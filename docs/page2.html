                <p> After Milo has completed the scrapping and auto tagging of all the text script,
                    I then take the scripts and import them to eXist-db to xQuery them. I used
                    xQuery to help separate and list out pieces of information that are deemed
                    useful. In this example, I’ve deemed all pieces of text that are surrounded by
                    music notes to be pulled and listed alongside the season it appeared in. Dr.
                    Beshero-Bondar and I collaborated on this xQuery to get the song lyrics since
                    for-loops are not my strong suit. I did, however, learn from that collaboration
                    and created another xQuery to section the music into episodes. In the figure
                    below is part of the output I got after xQuery: </p>

                <p>I then took that output and imported it into CytoScape to visualize the data.
                    CytoScape is good with networking and can network large amounts of data at once.
                    For this example, I set the lyrics to be connected to each season it appeared
                    in. I also have it set to have the connecting lines to have a growing width
                    based on how repetitive it is per season, same with its color gradient. Below is
                    the Music Network in Seasons, you can zoom and move elements around below:</p>

                <p>I used the same xQuery process from making the seasons network to make the
                    episodes network. Here is the xQuery Output I got along with the Music Network
                    in Seasons. <b>Be sure to click the Music Network in Episodes picture</b> to see
