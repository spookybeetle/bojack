                <h4>Name Type Appearances</h4>
                <p>Bojack Horseman has a plethora of names that appear throughout the show including people, organizations, 
                    locations, and ethnicities. The ammount of times each type of name appears in the show can display the 
                    of these types of names throughout the show.</p>
                <p>The first category on the graph is Person. This category is for every name of a person or living bweing
                    that appears in the show. It takes up a whopping 82.2% of all names that show up in the show, which makes sense.
                    What is a show without its cast of characters?</p>
                <p>The second category represented is "Global Political Entities", or in other words any country that is referenced
                    directly by name in the show. Surprisingly, countries are not mentioned all too much in the show. However; what is more
                    interesting than that is how organizations (represented by ORG) are mentioned less than GPE's. The show is full
                    of companies and their products. A good bulk of the episodes reference a company by name, too. It is surprising that the 
                    numbers show that companies and organizations just appear so little throughout the series.</p>
                <p>The next category is NORP, standing for Nationalities, or Religious/Political Groups. For how gruff of a show Bojack Horseman
                    is, is comfotig in a sense to see how little these groups are referenced. The show has its moments (as the Nazi Party is
                    referenced by name on more than one occasion) but seeing that NORP take up less than 2% of all names mentioned shows how aware/self
                    aware the show is.</p>
                <p>The final category is LOC, standing for Location (excluding GPE). This was one of the most shocking data points to see. Locations 
                    seem to be mentioned constantly, but they make up less than 1% of all names mentioned in the show.</p>
