            <div class="data">
                <p> After Milo has completed the scrapping and auto tagging of all the text script,
                    I then take the scripts and import them to eXist-db to xQuery them. I used
                    xQuery to help separate and list out pieces of information that are deemed
                    useful. In this example, I’ve deemed all pieces of text that are surrounded by
                    music notes to be pulled and listed alongside the season it appeared in. Dr.
                    Beshero-Bondar and I collaborated on this xQuery to get the song lyrics since
                    for-loops are not my strong suit. I did, however, learn from that collaboration
                    and will create another xQuery to section the music into episodes. </p>
                <p> After querying the music into seasons, I then took the output and imported it
                    into CytoScape to visualize the data. CytoScape is good with networking and can
                    network large amounts of data at once. For this example, I set the lyrics to be
                    connected to the seasons it’s mentioned. I also have it set to have the
                    connecting lines to have a growing width based on how repetitive it is, same
                    with its color gradient. </p>
