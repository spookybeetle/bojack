            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <div class="data">
                <h4>Name Type Appearances</h4>
                <p>Bojack Horseman has a plethora of names that appear throughout the show including
                    people, organizations, locations, and ethnicities. The ammount of times each
                    type of name appears in the show can display the of these types of names
                    throughout the show.</p>
                <p>The first category on the graph is Person. This category is for every name of a
                    person or living bweing that appears in the show. It takes up a whopping 82.2%
                    of all names that show up in the show, which makes sense. What is a show without
                    its cast of characters?</p>
                <p>The second category represented is "Global Political Entities", or in other words
                    any country that is referenced directly by name in the show. Surprisingly,
                    countries are not mentioned all too much in the show. However; what is more
                    interesting than that is how organizations (represented by ORG) are mentioned
                    less than GPE's. The show is full of companies and their products. A good bulk
                    of the episodes reference a company by name, too. It is surprising that the
                    numbers show that companies and organizations just appear so little throughout
                    the series.</p>
                <p>The next category is NORP, standing for Nationalities, or Religious/Political
                    Groups. For how gruff of a show Bojack Horseman is, is comfotig in a sense to
                    see how little these groups are referenced. The show has its moments (as the
                    Nazi Party is referenced by name on more than one occasion) but seeing that NORP
                    take up less than 2% of all names mentioned shows how aware/self aware the show
                    is.</p>
                <p>The final category is LOC, standing for Location (excluding GPE). This was one of
                    the most shocking data points to see. Locations seem to be mentioned constantly,
                    but they make up less than 1% of all names mentioned in the show.</p>

                    Person, 82.2%. GPE, 7.9%. ORG 7.7%. NORP, 1.4%. LOC, .082%" class="milo"/>
                <h4>Song Appearances Throughout Seasons</h4>
                <p>Music is a key aspect of the Bojack Horseman series. It is used to convery time,
                    emotions, and common themes. There is also usage for comedical purposes. The
                    image below shows the middle portion of the Music Network in Seasons from the
                    Virtualization page. Here we can see that the middle section has lyrics that are
                    connected to nearly all Bojacks seasons. We think that this is due to the intro
                    song being played in nearly all episodes of the series. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>In this image of the same network, we see that Season 5 is completely cut off from
                the rest of the series. This is interesting since even the intro song is not in any
                way connected to Season 5. The show at this point shows that Bojack is at his lowest
                in life. He is back on drugs and has influenced his co-star to do the same. He has
                also at the same time lost a couple of loved ones and slowly the friendships of
                others. Is perhaps the sudden change in connection in Season 5.</p>

            <p>Even in this image of the Music Network in Episodes show that, overall Season 5 only
                has songs in very few of its episodes.</p>
