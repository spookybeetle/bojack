<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur mother's having another one

of her episodes.

</line>


<line>
Last night, she went to see <ital>A Doll's <name type="ORG">House</name></ital>

with a couple girlfriends,

and now she has ideas.

</line>


<line>
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

to discover that not only had she

not made me l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch,

which is a meal I need in order to live,

but she'd furthermore, locked herself

in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

</line>


<line>
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

but when they do it at such a volume

you can hear it through the door,

then you know they're doing it

just for the attention.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I was able to cobble together

a sandwich for myself,

so, I'm the real hero of the story.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rn <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nking]

-[tires screeching]

</line>


<line>
It was a couple <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs later

when I realized I was on a good r<name type="ORG">un</name>

with my novel.

</line>


<line>
I had this really interesting sentence

that kept going for pages and pages,

and I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w rare it is

to really get in the groove like that.

</line>


<line>
How, most days, I can't concentrate

because my idiot child

is blasting the television,

and it suddenly dawned on me;

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t cock on a rock,

she never even picked up

the little noise and snot factory!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[tires screech, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rn <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nking]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, here I am, being your mother,

which I know is giving you all sorts

of mixed-up ideas about gender,

while your brain

is still loose and stupid.

</line>


<line>
Just remember,

if you become a queer later in life,

this isn't my fault!

</line>


<line>
Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub

act called, "My <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy was My <name type="PERSON">Mo</name><name type="PERSON">mm</name>y,"

while <name type="PERSON">ga</name>zing longingly

at a tangled string of pearls.

</line>


<line>
Pearls are for ladies, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Pearls are for ladies.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know S<name type="ORG">un</name>day is my writing day.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="ORG">un</name>days are the one day

that are just for me and my craft,

and still, you and the black <name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

that birthed you

conspire to ruin it for me.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do now?

Just go back to writing?

</line>


<line>
I'm out of the zone now,

the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le day's s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t!

</line>


<line>
All because of you

and that brittle wisp of a woman

you made the mistake

of making your mother.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> No. It's not her fault.

</line>


<line>
She's doing the best she can, after all.

</line>


<line>
It's just that...

you can't depend on women.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't depend on anyone.

</line>


<line>
Sooner or later, you need to learn

that no one else

is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take care of you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I learned

when I had to make my own sandwich.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't rely on other people, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's good for you to know that.

</line>


<line>
And she's a good mother

for teaching you that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've got a head start on most kids.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're actually very lucky.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[music continues over radio]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>haaaaank youuuuu?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, I stopped at a <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>x,

on the way here,

and the girl behind the co<name type="ORG">un</name>ter said,

"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

</line>


<line>
Not, "How are you doing today?"

No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

</line>


<line>
Which is pretty shitty because it puts

the onus on me to disagree with her,

like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"

suddenly I'm the ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive one.

</line>


<line>
Usually, when people ask <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I'm doing,

the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

but I can't say I'm doing shitty

because I don't have a good reason

to be doing shitty.

</line>


<line>
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"

then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

</line>


<line>
And I have to be like,

"I don't know, all of it?"

</line>


<line>
So instead, when people ask <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I'm doing,

I usually say, "I am doing so great."

</line>


<line>
But when this girl at the <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>x

asked me if I was having an awesome day,

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught, well, today

I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

today I have a good reason,

so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

</line>


<line>
And she i<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ediately burst into tears.

</line>


<line>
So, now I have to comfort her,

which is annoying,

and meanwhile, there's a line

of people forming behind me,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are all giving me

these real judgy looks

because I made

the <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>x girl cry.

</line>


<line>
And she's bawling, and she's saying,

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

and I'm like, <name type="PERSON">"It</name>'s fine. It's fine.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's not fine,

but, you know, it's... fine.

</line>


<line>
And I would like to order

a Double <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> Meal,

and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

so maybe less with the crying

and more with the frying, huh?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[inhales]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> And the girl apologizes, a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

and she offers me a free churro

with my meal.

</line>


<line>
And as I'm leaving,

I think, "I just got a free churro

because my mom died."

</line>


<line>
No one ever tells you when your mom dies,

you get a free churro.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[people murmuring]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clears throat]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Anyway, I'm sorry,

that's not part of the...

[clears throat] All right.

</line>


<line>
Okay, here we go. Let's do this.

</line>


<line>
Here I am, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

doing a eulogy, let's go.

</line>


<line>
Hey, piano man,

can I get like a, like an or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n flourish?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n plays]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Nicely done.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I was a little worried

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't have the right

accompaniment today.

</line>


<line>
I guess it's a good thing my mom

was an or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n donor!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[rims<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t plays]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-What happened to the or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n?

-[<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rn "oo<name type="PERSON">ga</name>hs"]

</line>


<line>
Why don't you leave

the comedy to the professionals?

</line>


<line>
Okay? <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral, sir,

for my mother.

</line>


<line>
Can you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w a little respect?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[trumpet whines]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I'll take it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bea</name>trice <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was she?

What was her deal?

</line>


<line>
Well, she was a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse.

</line>


<line>
Uh, she was born in 1938.

She died in 2018.

</line>


<line>
One time, she went to a parade,

</line>


<line>
and one time, she smoked

an entire ci<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rette in one long inhale.

</line>


<line>
I watched her do it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ruly a remarkable woman.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[rustling]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Lived a full life, that lady.

</line>


<line>
Just, all the way to the end,

which is, uh, now, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Really makes you think, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, huh?

</line>


<line>
Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen you die.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's my time,

you've been great! <name type="PERSON">T</name>ip your waitress!

</line>


<line>
No, I'm just kidding aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

there's no waitress.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's all I have to say about my mother.

</line>


<line>
No point beating a dead <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse, right?

</line>


<line>
So... [inhales] Now what?

I don't know, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m, you got any ideas?

</line>


<line>
Anything?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m?

</line>


<line>
No?

</line>


<line>
Nothing to contribute?

Knock once if you're proud of me.

</line>


<line>
Can I just say <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w amazing it is

to be in a room with my mother,

and I can just talk wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut her telling me

to shut up and make her a drink?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m. Knock once

if you think I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld shut up.

</line>


<line>
No? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,

by making this eulogy into a me-logy,

so, seriously,

if you wanted me to sit down

and let someone else talk, just knock.

I will not be offended.

</line>


<line>
No? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.

</line>


<line>
She wanted an open casket,

but, you know, she's dead now,

so w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares what she wanted?

</line>


<line>
No, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds bad. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I think that if she could've seen

what she looked like dead,

she'd agree it's better this way.

She looked like this.

</line>


<line>
-[groaning]

-[mourners <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]

</line>


<line>
Kinda like a pissed-off toy dinosaur.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.

</line>


<line>
So, now her face is forever frozen

in a mask of tremendous <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rror

and anguish.

</line>


<line>
Or as my mom called it, <name type="PERSON">T</name>uesday!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>uesday! My mom called it <name type="PERSON">T</name>uesday.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[woman coughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m, what did you think of that joke?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u like that?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[woman coughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u never did care for my comedy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clears throat]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Here's a story.

</line>


<line>
When I was a teenager,

</line>


<line>
I performed a comedy routine

for my high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol talent s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was this cool <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et

that I wanted to wear

because it would make me

look like <name type="PERSON">Al<name type="PERSON">bert</name> Brooks</name>.

</line>


<line>
For months, I saved up for this <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et,

but when I finally had enough,

I went to the store and it was gone.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey had just sold it to someone else.

So, I went <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me and I told my mother.

</line>


<line>
She said, <name type="PERSON">"Let</name> that be a lesson.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the good

that comes from wanting things."

</line>


<line>
She was really good

at dispensing life lessons,

that always seemed to circle back

to everything being my fault.

</line>


<line>
But then, on the day of the talent s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

my mother had a surprise for me.

</line>


<line>
She had bought me the <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et.

</line>


<line>
Even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh she didn't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to say it,

I knew this meant that she loved me.

</line>


<line>
Now, that's a good story about my mother.

</line>


<line>
It's not true,

but it's a good story, right?

</line>


<line>
I stole it from an episode of <ital><name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ude </ital>I saw

when i was a kid,

where she talks about her father.

</line>


<line>
I remember when I saw it,

thinking that's the kind of story

</line>


<line>
I want to tell

about my parents when they die.

</line>


<line>
But I don't have any stories like that.

</line>


<line>
All I know about being good

I learned from <name type="PERSON">T</name>V.

</line>


<line>
And in <name type="PERSON">T</name>V, flawed characters

are constantly s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wing people they care

with these surprising grand gestures.

</line>


<line>
And I think that part of me

still believes that's what love is.

</line>


<line>
But in real life,

the big gesture isn't enough.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to be consistent,

you need to be dependably good.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't just screw everything up,

and then take a boat out into the ocean

to save your best friend,

or solve a mystery, and fly to <name type="GPE">Kansas</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to do it every day,

which is so... hard.

</line>


<line>
When you're a kid, you convince yourself

that maybe the grand gesture

could be enough.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh your parents

aren't what you need them to be,

over and over and over a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

at any moment they might surprise you,

with something... wonderful.

</line>


<line>
I kept waiting for that, the proof,

that even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh my mother

was a hard woman,

deep down, she loved me

and cared about me

and wanted me to know

that I made her life

a little bit brighter.

</line>


<line>
Even now, I find myself waiting.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m, knock once if you love me

and care about me,

and want me to know I made your life

a little bit brighter.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[owl chirping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
My mother did not go <ital>gentle</ital>

into that good night.

</line>


<line>
She went clawing and fighting

and thrashing, hence the face.

</line>


<line>
-[groaning]

-[mourners <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]

</line>


<line>
If you'd seen her,

</line>


<line>
I swear to <name type="PERSON">God</name> the only thing

you'd be thinking about right now

is that I am nailing this impression.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-[woman</name> clears her throat]

-[chairs squeak]

</line>


<line>
I was in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital with her

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se last moments,

and they were truly <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rrifying,

full of nonsensical screams and cries,

but there was this moment,

this one instant of strange calm,

where she looked in my direction

and said, "I see you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the last thing she said to me.

"I see you."

</line>


<line>
Not a statement of judgment

or disappointment, just acceptance

and the simple recognition

of another person in a room.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">"Hello</name>, there. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are a person.

And I see you."

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you,

it's a weird thing to feel

at 54 years old,

that for the first time in your life

your mother sees you.

</line>


<line>
It's an odd realization that it's

the thing you've been missing,

the only thing you wanted all along,

to be seen.

</line>


<line>
And it doesn't feel like a relief,

to finally be seen.

</line>


<line>
It feels mean, like,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, it turns out that you knew

what I wanted,

and you waited <name type="ORG">un</name>til the very last moment

to give it to me."

</line>


<line>
I was prepared for more cruelty.

</line>


<line>
I was sure that she would get

in one final zinger,

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I let her down,

and about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I was fat and stupid,

and too tall to be

an effective <name type="PERSON">Lindy-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>pper</name>.

</line>


<line>
How I was needy and a burden

and an embarrassment.

</line>


<line>
All that I was ready for.

I was not ready for "I see you."

</line>


<line>
Only my mother would be lousy enough

to swipe me

with a moment of connection

on her way out.

</line>


<line>
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it wasn't about connection.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it was a... <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it was

an "I see you," like, "I see you."

</line>


<line>
Like, <name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name> might have the rest

of the world fooled,

but I know exactly w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's more my mom's speed.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe she just literally meant

"I see you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are an object

that has entered my field of vision."

</line>


<line>
She was out of it at the end,

so maybe it's dumb

to try to attribute it to anything.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-[woman</name> sighs]

-Back in the 90s,

</line>


<line>
I was in a very famous <name type="PERSON">T</name>V S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

called <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[man coughs]

-Please <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld your applause.

</line>


<line>
And I remember one time, a fan asked me,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, um, you know that episode

where the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse has to give <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>

a pep talk,

after <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> finds out his crush

only asked him to the dance

because her friends were having

a dorkiest date contest?

</line>


<line>
In all the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ts of the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse,

you can see a paper coffee cup

on the kitchen co<name type="ORG">un</name>ter,

but in the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ts of <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>,

the coffee cup's missing.

</line>


<line>
Was that because the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

was making a statement,

about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

and <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w even two people

can experience the same moment

in entirely different ways?

</line>


<line>
And I didn't have the heart to be, like,

</line>


<line>
"No, man, some crew guy

just left their coffee cup in the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t."

</line>


<line>
So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."

</line>


<line>
And maybe this is like that coffee cup.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe, we're dumb to try to pin

significance onto every little thing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe, when someone says,

"I see you," it just means, "I see you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, it's possible

she wasn't even talking to me.

</line>


<line>
Because, if I'm being <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest,

she wasn't really looking at me,

she was looking past me.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was nobody else in the room.

</line>


<line>
I think she was talking to me,

but, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly,

she was so far gone at that point,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows what she was seeing.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> were you talking to, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Not saying, huh? Staying mum?

</line>


<line>
No rims<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t there?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, whatever I'm paying you,

it's too much.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe, she saw my dad.

</line>


<line>
My dad died about ten years ago

of injuries he sustained during a duel.

</line>


<line>
When your father dies,

you ask yourself a lot of questions.

</line>


<line>
Questions like,

"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"

and <name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> dies in a duel?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing was so stupid.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Dad</name> spent his entire life

writing this book,

but he couldn't get any stores

to carry it,

or any newspapers to review it.

</line>


<line>
Finally, I guess this one newspaper

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught he was pretty hilarious,

because they ran a review

and tore him to shreds.

</line>


<line>
So, my father, ever the Proud <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ry,

decided he would not stand

for this besmirchment of his <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor.

</line>


<line>
He claimed the critic didn't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

what it meant to be a man,

so he <name type="NORP">dem</name>anded satisfaction

in the form of pistols at dawn.

</line>


<line>
He wrote the paper, this letter,

saying anyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> didn't like his book,

he would challenge to a duel,

anyone in the world.

</line>


<line>
He'd even pay for airfare

to <name type="GPE">San Francisco</name> and a night in a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>tel.

</line>


<line>
Well, eventually this fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d its way

to some kook in <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ntana,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was as batshit as he was

and took him up on the offer.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey met at <name type="FAC">Golden Gate Park</name> and agreed:

ten paces, then s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot.

</line>


<line>
But in the middle of the ten paces,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Dad</name> turned to ask the guy if he'd actually

read the book and what he t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

but, not looking where he was going,

tripped over an exposed root

and bashed his head on a rock.

</line>

<line>
I wish I'd known to go

to <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>x then.

</line>


<line>
I could have gotten a free churro.

It would've been nice

to have something to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w for being

the son of <name type="ORG">Butterscotch</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
My darling mother <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve the eulogy.

</line>


<line>
My entire life I never heard her say

a kind word to or about my father,

but at his f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral she said,

</line>


<line>
"My husband is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clearing throat]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
"My husband is dead,

</line>


<line>
I don't know why she said that.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe she felt that's the kind of thing

you're supposed to say at a f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe she <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ped one day

someone would say that about her.

</line>


<line>
"My mother is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>


<line>
Or maybe she knew

that he had frittered away

all her inheritance,

and replaced it with crippling debt,

which is a pretty shitty thing

to leave your widow with.

</line>


<line>
"Bad news, you lost a husband,

but don't worry, you also lost the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use!"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m knew she'd have to sell

all her fancy jewelry

and move into a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe that's what she meant by

"everything is worse."

</line>


<line>
Is that what you meant, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m?

</line>


<line>
I gotta say,

I'm really carrying this double act.

</line>


<line>
At least with <name type="ORG">Penn</name> and <name type="PERSON">T</name>eller,

the quiet one does card tricks.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se parties, they were really something.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here were skits and magic acts,

and ethnically insensitive

vaudeville routines,

and the big finale

was always a dance my mother did.

</line>


<line>
She had this beautiful dress that she only

brought out for these parties,

and she did this incredible number.

</line>


<line>
It was so beautiful and sad.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Dad</name> hated the parties.

He'd lock himself in the study,

and bang on the walls

for us to keep it down,

but he always came out to see <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m dance.

</line>


<line>
He'd linger in the doorway,

scotch in hand,

and watch in awe, as this cynical,

despicable woman he married...

took flight.

</line>


<line>
And as a child w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was completely

terrified of both my parents,

</line>


<line>
I was always aware

that this moment of grace,

it meant something.

</line>


<line>
We <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood each other, in a way.

</line>


<line>
Me and my mom and my dad,

as screwed up as we all were,

we did <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand each other.

</line>


<line>
My mother, she knew

what it's like to feel your entire life

like you're drowning

with the exception of these moments,

these very rare, brief instances,

in which you suddenly remember...

you can swim.

</line>

</line>


<line>
But, then a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, mostly not.

<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>stly you're drowning.

</line>


<line>
She <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood that too.

</line>


<line>
And she recognized that I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood it.

And <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.

</line>


<line>
All three of us were drowning,

and we didn't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to save each other,

but there was an <name type="ORG">un</name>derstanding

that we were all drowning together.

</line>


<line>
I would like to think

that's what she meant

when we were in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital

and she said, "I see you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he weird thing

about both your parents being dead

is it means that you're next.

</line>


<line>
I mean, you know, obviously it's not

like there's a wait list for dying.

</line>


<line>
Any one of us could get r<name type="ORG">un</name> over

by a <name type="PERSON">Snapchat</name>ting teen at any moment.

</line>


<line>
And you would think that knowing that

would make us more adventurous,

and kind, and forgiving.

</line>


<line>
But it makes us small,

and stupid, and petty.

</line>


<line>
I actually had a near-death experience,

recently.

</line>


<line>
A st<name type="ORG">un</name>t went bad

and I fell off a building.

</line>


<line>
I'm an actor. I do my own st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts.

<line>
It hasn't come out yet,

but it's already getting E<name type="PERSON">mm</name>y buzz.

</line>


<line>
Oh, speaking of buzz...

[inhales]

</line>


<line>
I've to take

two of these every morning,

but my days are so screwed up

'cause of the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting schedule,

</line>


<line>
I don't even know

what morning means anymore.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's a joke in there somewhere,

about a guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s been to so many f<name type="ORG">un</name>erals,

he doesn't even know

what mourning means anymore.

</line>


<line>
Let you guys figure that one out

for yourselves. [gulps]

</line>


<line>
Anyway, you know what I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught...

when I was falling off the building

and I went into panic mode?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last thing that my stupid brain

could come up with before I died?

</line>


<line>
"Won't they be sorry."

</line>


<line>
-Cool t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught, brain.

-[rims<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t plays]

</line>


<line>
No, that wasn't...

</line>


<line>
Would you just... <name type="PERSON">Di</name>al it back, all right?

</line>


<line>
I don't even know what "they"

I wanted to be sorry.

</line>


<line>
My mom, even before she died,

could barely remember w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I was.

</line>


<line>
And of course, my dad's dead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last conversation I ever had with him

was about his novel.

</line>


<line>
He was so certain

this book was his le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>cy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe he t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it would vindicate him

for all the shitty things he ever did

in his stupid worthless life.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it did. I don't know.

I never read it.

</line>


<line>
Because why would I give him that?

</line>


<line>
I used to be on this <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

called <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Seriously, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld your applause.

</line>


<line>
-[man coughs]

-Well held.

</line>


<line>
It was written by my friend <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s also dead now,

and it starred this little girl

named <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
And it was about these orphans.

And early on, the network had a note,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe don't mention

they're orphans,

because audiences tend

to find orphans sad and not relatable."

</line>


<line>
I never t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught the orphans were sad.

</line>


<line>
I always t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught they were lucky

because they could imagine their parents

to be anything they wanted.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey had something to long for.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, we did this one season finale,

where <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>'s birth mother comes to town.

</line>


<line>
And she was a j<name type="ORG">un</name>kie,

but she's gotten herself cleaned up,

and she wants to be

in <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>'s life a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
And of course, she's like a perfect

grown-up version of <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>,

and they go to the mall together

and get her ears pierced,

like she's always wanted and--

</line>


<line>
Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six

finale of <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,</ital>

if you're still working

your way through it.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse tries

to warn her, "Be careful,

moms have a way of letting you down."

</line>


<line>
But <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> just thinks

the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse is jealous,

and when the mom says

she's moving to <name type="GPE">California</name>,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> decides to go with her.

</line>


<line>
And the network really juiced

the cliffhanger:

</line>


<line>
''Is <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> gone for good?''

</line>


<line>
But of course, because it's a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

she was not gone for good.

</line>


<line>
Of course, because it's a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>'s mother had a relapse

and had to go back to rehab,

so <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> had to hitchhike

all the way <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

getting rides from Mr. <name type="PERSON">T</name>,

Alf, and the cast of <ital>Stomp.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Of course that's what happened.

</line>


<line>
Because, what are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do,

just not have <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> on the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't have happy endings in sitcoms,

not really,

because, if everyone's happy,

the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w would be over,

and above all else,

the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w... has to keep going.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's always more s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
And you can call <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d </ital>dumb,

or bad, or <name type="ORG">un</name>realistic,

but there is nothing more realistic

than that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u never get a happy ending,

'cause there's always more s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
I guess <name type="ORG">un</name>til there isn't.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
My mom would hate it if she knew

that I spent so much time at her f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral

talking about my old <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe she'd think it was f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny

that her idiot son

couldn't even do this right. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows?

</line>


<line>
She left no instructions

for what she wanted me to say.

</line>


<line>
All I know is she wanted an open casket,

and her idiot son

couldn't even do that right.

</line>


<line>
I'll stand up here and pretend

</line>


<line>
I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to please that woman,

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh so much of my life has been

wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.

</line>


<line>
But I keep going back to that moment

in the ICU when she looked at me, and...

</line>


<line>
"I-C-U."

</line>


<line>
"I... see... you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ,

we were in the intensive care <name type="ORG">un</name>it.

</line>


<line>
She was just reading a sign.

</line>


<line>
My mom died and all I got

was this free churro.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know the shittiest thing

about all of this?

</line>


<line>
Is when that stranger behind the co<name type="ORG">un</name>ter

<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve me that free churro,

that small act of kindness

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed more compassion

than my mother <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve me

her entire goddamn life.

</line>


<line>
Like, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard is it to do something nice

for a person?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his woman at the <name type="PERSON">Jack</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>x

didn't even know me.

</line>


<line>
I'm your son.

</line>


<line>
All I had was you!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[inhales]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I have this friend.

</line>


<line>
And right aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d when I first met her,

her dad died, and I actually went with her

to the f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
And months later, she told me

that she didn't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why she was still upset,

because she never even liked her father.

</line>


<line>
It made sense to me, because I went

through the same thing when my dad died.

</line>


<line>
And I'm going through the same thing now.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what it's like?

</line>


<line>
It's like that s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <ital><name type="PERSON">Beck</name>er,</ital>

you know, with <name type="PERSON">T</name>ed Danson?

</line>


<line>
I watched the entire r<name type="ORG">un</name> of it,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping that it would get better,

and it never did.

</line>


<line>
It had all the right pieces, but it just--

It couldn't put them together.

</line>


<line>
And when it got canceled,

</line>


<line>
I was really bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ed out,

not because I liked the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

but because I knew it could be

so much better,

and now it never would be.

And that's what losing a parent is like.

</line>


<line>
It's like <ital><name type="PERSON">Beck</name>er.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Suddenly, you realize you'll never have

the good relationship you wanted,

and as long as they were alive,

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh you'd never admit it,

part of you,

the stupidest goddamn part of you,

was still <name type="PERSON">ho</name>lding on to that chance.

</line>


<line>
And you didn't even realize it

<name type="ORG">un</name>til that chance went away.

</line>


<line>
"My mother is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>


<line>
Because now I know

I will never have a mother

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> looks at me from across a room

and says,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man, I see you."

</line>


<line>
But I guess it's good to know.

</line>


<line>
It's good to know

that there is nobody looking out for me,

that there never was,

and there never will be.

</line>


<line>
No, it's good to know that I am

the only one that I can depend on.

</line>


<line>
And I know that now and it's good.

It's good that I know that.
