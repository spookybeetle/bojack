<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane]</nonVerbComm> The series is called

Crooshing <name type="GPE">US</name>A.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>What does that mean?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Crooshness is hard to define,

but I also don't know it when I see it.

</line>


<line>
Oop. Pardon my reach.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls

interested in agriculture.

</line>


<line>
You might say I've got my eyes on them.

Potato eyes, that is.

</line>


<line>
-Guy?

-[Guy] Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
Hey, girls! It's Diane,

outside <name type="GPE">Idaho</name>'s largest potato supplier,

</line>


<line>
-Starch Farms.

-Hello!

</line>


<line>
Let me get this straight.

</line>


<line>
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,

two types of onions,

and is also a front

for a local sex trafficking ring?

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

-How'd you get started in sex trafficking?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't think

I'm getting that microphone back.

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond straight year</ital>

<ital>this <name type="GPE">Michigan</name> resort's food</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>has tested positive for avian botulism.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Wow, two years in a row.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's like the Tom Hanks</ital>

<ital>of poisoning people.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>They said the jewelry is safe</ital>

<ital>for humans now,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but I've been wearing this</ital>

<ital>for a week, and...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Can we get more B-roll

so we have something to cut away to

when I have to scratch my nose?

</line>


<line>
I thought scratching your nose

was your way of saying hello to me.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Don't you find it a little convenient</ital>

<ital>that the mayor has yet to restore</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>clean drinking water to this part of--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>No, it's quite in-convenient.</ital>

<ital>You think this is convenient?</ital>

</line>


<line>
The East Side is a lower-income area,

ergo the residents

are not huge campaign donors, ergo--

</line>


<line>
No, the mayor

didn't target that neighborhood,

he was just that stupid

when it came to water filtration.

</line>


<line>
He was just stupid enough to think

he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

</line>


<line>
Say "ergo" one more time.

</line>


<line>
-Ergo.

-Nah.

</line>


<line>
-No, no, no, no.

-[Diane giggles]

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is Diane Nguyen...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is Diane... This is Di...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is Diane Nguyen,</ital>

<ital>and that's the </ital>Croosh!

</line>


<line>
-[Guy mumbles] Let me see.

-Did you hear

about Philip Morris <name type="ORG">Disney</name> Fox

</line>


<line>
AT&amp;T AOL <name type="ORG">Time</name> Warner PepsiCo

Haliburton Skynet <name type="ORG">Toyota</name> <name type="ORG">Trader Joe's</name>?

</line>


<line>
-What about them?

-They got acquired by Whitewhale.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

Well, how many companies are there now?

</line>


<line>
Four? [gasps]

</line>


<line>
-What is it?

-I'm sorry, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.

</line>


<line>
-Huh.

-I mean, this is <name type="ORG">un</name>professional. One bed!

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do

with just one bed?

</line>


<line>
Quite a pickle.

</line>


<line>
I should march right back down

to that front desk and tell them--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you... [chuckles]

for helping me with my one bed bit.

</line>


<line>
-[both moan]

-It's a good bit.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack's voice]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Dear Diane, hello.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Guy snores]

<ital>-This is a letter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="ORG">Rehab</name> is making me write a letter</ital>

<ital>to a friend</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>because I guess letter writing</ital>

<ital>is therapeutic?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I hear it did wonders</ital>

<ital>for the <name type="ORG">Zodiac</name> killer.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Anyway, rehab's going fine.</ital>

<ital>A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and I think next week,</ital>

<ital>we're doing a color war.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And it's good that I'm here,</ital>

<ital>and it's good that I'm not drinking</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>or taking pills, but I keep thinking</ital>

<ital>about how this isn't real life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>As nice as this is, I know that someday</ital>

<ital>I'll have to go back to the real world.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Lady, listen, can you put him

on the phone, please?

</line>


<line>
I don't care if he doesn't wanna

talk to me. I'm his father. No, Lady--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Guy groans angrily]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack's voice]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Anyway, that's my letter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I probably won't even send it,</ital>

<ital>but if you're reading this, I guess I did?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Your friend, BoJack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>P.S. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm only in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> for a week.

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's selfish

to wanna see my son.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but you gotta give your ex notice.

</line>


<line>
Whose side are you on?

</line>


<line>
Uh... Hey, look out the window.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Guy]</nonVerbComm> Wow, there she is!

</line>


<line>
The <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond windy, muddy,

big-shoulders city by the lake.

</line>


<line>
Look! Willis Tower.

Oh, and look, the new Whitewhale building!

</line>


<line>
You cannot be excited

about a giant corporation like Whitewhale

setting up shop in your hometown.

</line>


<line>
I'm just excited

we got a new big building.

</line>


<line>
-In your face, <name type="GPE">Dubai</name>.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man gasps and pants]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...

-Ah...

</line>


<line>
-Not bad.

-It's because the bread

</line>


<line>
is made from lake water and lard.

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzes]

<ital>-From <name type="GPE">New York</name> <name type="ORG">Time</name>s, I'm Michael Barbaro.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Today, your phone is ringing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Here's what you need to know about people</ital>

<ital>who still use their phone to call people.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Stefani.

</line>


<line>
Hey, girl!

</line>


<line>
-No, no, it's Guy.

<ital>-[Stefani] Hey, Guy!</ital>

</line>


<line>
I got you on speaker. Diane's eating

the best sandwich of her life.

</line>


<line>
-It's okay.

-[Stefani exhales]

</line>


<line>
Diane, I love

that you still eat sandwiches.

</line>


<line>
Flaws like that are what make you

relatable to regular women.

</line>


<line>
-[gulps] What?

-Meanwhile,

</line>


<line>
I am adoring your cross-co<name type="ORG">un</name>try exposition

of the ugly <name type="ORG">un</name>derbelly

of <name type="GPE">America</name>n capitalism.

</line>


<line>
So croosh.

</line>


<line>
But I wonder if you could make room

in the rotation

</line>


<line>
for a few feel-good stories?

</line>


<line>
Stefani, our videos

are making a difference.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be some good news out there.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-We'll see what we can do!

</line>


<line>
-Why'd you say yes?

-We can do feel-good stories.

</line>


<line>
What about that girl who opened up

a lemonade stand

to pay for her dad's cancer treatment?

</line>


<line>
How is that a feel-good story?

</line>


<line>
"Hey, <name type="GPE">America</name>! We're the only developed

nation without subsidized healthcare,

so this child joined

the workforce in a desperate bid

to keep her father alive!"

</line>


<line>
Okay. How 'bout this?

</line>


<line>
Local cameraman has a pretty

good thing going,

</line>


<line>
where he gets to travel

all over the co<name type="ORG">un</name>try

</line>


<line>
and fool aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d in hotel rooms with

his beautiful, smart, feisty producer...

</line>


<line>
and he's pretty sure

this passionate, intelligent,

warrior for truth likes it too,

so maybe these two knuckleheads

should swallow their pride for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond

and make some feel-good videos.

</line>


<line>
Hey, girls.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Diane.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Tell me

about <name type="ORG">the Every Animal Girl Company</name>.

</line>


<line>
We are two best friends

who got tired of seeing dolls

promoting <name type="ORG">un</name>realistic beauty standards.

</line>


<line>
Take Ginny here.

</line>


<line>
Most giraffe dolls have necks

one inch shorter by scale

than the average girl giraffe.

</line>


<line>
Not our Ginny.

</line>


<line>
Her neck is long and proud,

for all our <name type="GPE">necky</name> gals out there.

</line>


<line>
As a <name type="GPE">necky</name> gal, I love that.

</line>


<line>
And is it true that all your dolls

are made out of recycled material?

</line>


<line>
-Uh... No.

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
-Sorry?

-Well, traditionally...

</line>


<line>
-[overlapping dialogue]

-The first batch, um...

</line>


<line>
The important thing is

we're two best friends.

</line>


<line>
Okay, what's going on?

</line>


<line>
Uh... [giggles nervously]

</line>


<line>
Okay. We are excited to anno<name type="ORG">un</name>ce

that as of today,

<name type="ORG">the Every Animal Girl Company</name>

has been purchased by <name type="ORG">Toys Galore</name>,

a subsidiary

of <name type="ORG">Whitewhale Consolidated Interests</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yay! <name type="ORG">Toys Galore</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
"Yay..."

</line>


<line>
A small, independent start-up

bought out by a huge conglomerate.

</line>


<line>
It must be so empowering

to see your success grow.

</line>


<line>
What a happy story for two best friends.

Now, about the recycled materials?

</line>


<line>
Well, it's <name type="ORG">un</name>clear what role recycling

will play in the future of this company.

</line>


<line>
Right now, we're mainly focused

on empowering yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g girls

and closing the main <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> factory

so we can relocate overseas

for cheaper labor.

</line>


<line>
Right before the holidays!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm> Feel-good.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[strained]</nonVerbComm> What an exciting,

empowering time for you!

</line>


<line>
I know.

</line>


<line>
You think you can edit that down

into something feel-goody?

</line>


<line>
For sure.

It'll have to go up late, though,

because I'm having some friends over

to watch the game tonight.

</line>


<line>
God, I'm freezing.

</line>


<line>
-Aw.

-So, you, uh...

</line>


<line>
-You wanna watch the game with us?

-Are you asking me to meet your friends?

</line>


<line>
No, I just figure,

since you're staying with me anyway--

</line>


<line>
I would be delighted. Wait, it's not

the <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> Baby Humans game, is it?

</line>


<line>
It's just a mascot.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[reporter]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And there goes Waa-Waa,</ital>

<ital>the Baby Human, stumbling aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>like the furless, featherless dolt he is.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What's he got there?</ital>

<ital>Don't drink that poison, you crazy human!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-We don't drink poison.

<name type="ORG">-Diane</name>, he's not a literal human.

</line>


<line>
Waa-Waa is a tribute

to your proud human heritage.

</line>


<line>
-I'm very flattered.

-Anyway, meet the gang.

</line>


<line>
Everyone, this is Diane. My, um...

</line>


<line>
Ah... You know, my--

The woman that I work with.

</line>


<line>
-[all] Hi.

-[man] 'Sup, dude?

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...

-You okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Sorry, just-- I'll be right back.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-Diane</name>, I'm really sorry, but--

-It's fine.

</line>


<line>
I wasn't expecting, ya know,

in front of your friends.

</line>


<line>
-He just showed up.

-We haven't put a label on us.

</line>


<line>
-I'm not looking for--

-The speech and debate tournament

</line>


<line>
-was canceled on acco<name type="ORG">un</name>t of cyberbullying.

-Wait, what are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
-My son is here. He surprised me.

-Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
I usually don't bring women aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d my kid

<name type="ORG">un</name>less it's serious.

</line>


<line>
-I get it.

-Do you mind staying at a hotel?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah. Totally.

-He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
What if he sees me go out?

Is the coast clear?

</line>


<line>
-You should maybe go out the window.

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
This makes sense. But what about my stuff?

</line>


<line>
I'll pack your bag

and throw it out to you.

</line>


<line>
Okay, good. Bye.

Thank you for inviting me to your party.

</line>


<line>
You have a lovely home.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack's voice]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Dear Diane, hello.</ital>

<ital>I am writing you another letter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Today sucks. There's this new lady here,</ital>

<ital><name type="GPE">Beverly</name>, and she took my snack kit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And that is so classic <name type="GPE">Beverly</name>.</ital>

<ital>Probably. I just met her.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The whole point of the snack kits</ital>

<ital>is they're comm<name type="ORG">un</name>al, right?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>They're these bags full of snacks</ital>

<ital>that we take on our morning hikes,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and we put them together the night before</ital>

<ital>as, like, a team-building thing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag</ital>

<ital>of candied nuts into a snack kit,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>something just for me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I marked my bag with a "B"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>so I'd know which one to grab</ital>

<ital>in the morning.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"B" for "BoJack."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[groans angrily]

<ital>-But then today, I see <name type="GPE">Beverly</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>who, again, just got here,</ital>

<ital>waltzing aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the house</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody</ital>

<ital>made a special kit just for me!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>B for <name type="GPE">Beverly</name>!</ital>

<ital>I must have a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret admirer!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Again, just got here!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[shivering]

<ital>-The story of my life</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is that I never get anything nice.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You'd think that I'd learn to adjust</ital>

<ital>my expectations by now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But, no. Once again,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was the idiot</ital>

<ital>who got my hopes up about candied nuts,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and now I am disappointed</ital>

<ital>with no one to blame but myself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

<ital>-Anyway, what's new with you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm><ital> Just kidding,</ital>

<ital>you can't say anything, this is a letter!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Okay, talk soon. BoJack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[crickets chirping]

-[phone buzzes]

</line>


<line>
<ital>From <name type="GPE">New York</name> <name type="ORG">Time</name>s, I'm Michael Barbaro.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Today, your--</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-[Stefani] <ital>Diane, your last video--</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good

as maybe you wanted--

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding? I feel great!

</line>


<line>
You made a big impression with the guys

at Whitewhale.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-I'll say. They bought <name type="ORG">Girl Croosh</name>!

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Well, technically they bought <name type="ORG">Fuddruckers</name>

and merged it with <name type="ORG">Dow Chemical</name> to create

a new media venture called <name type="GPE">Spronk</name>!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-[Diane] Hold on--</ital>

-<name type="GPE">Spronk</name> acquired <name type="ORG">Univision</name>,

which will incorporate <name type="ORG">Girl Croosh</name>

into the <name type="ORG">Gizmodo</name>-branded mist

of advertorial.

</line>


<line>
-That's terrible!

-Not for me! I'm gonna be rich!

</line>


<line>
-You already are rich!

-Oh, yeah! [giggles]

</line>


<line>
Oops. Well, anyway, good luck with <name type="GPE">Spronk</name>,

which is currently rebranding

as <name type="ORG">Content Spew</name>.

</line>


<line>
So spew that content, girl! [giggles]

</line>


<line>
Bye!

</line>


<line>
Oh, spronk me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sputters]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Pardon our dust

while we finish construction.

</line>


<line>
Can I get you a <name type="ORG">Pepsi Cola</name>?

Or anything else from the vast Whitewhale

agglomeration of fine beverages?

[sputters]

</line>


<line>
Uh, I think we're good.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beep]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry about last night.

-It's fine. Let's just watch the movie.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Welcome!</ital>

<ital>Here at <name type="ORG">Whitewhale Consolidated Interests</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>we do it all through the free-market magic</ital>

<ital>of the Whitewhale Way!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> <ital>That's right, Mr. Whitewhale!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Who? Why? Where?</ital>

<ital>Whence forth are you two,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and how did you manifest in my office?</ital>

<ital>Be gone, ghastly ghouls!</ital>

</line>


<line>

<ital>We're no spooky specters! My name's Vert!</ital>

<line>
<ital>Vertical Integration!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I'm Ollie, the <name type="ORG">Oligopoly</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You summoned us here to tell your new</ital>

<ital>employees about the Whitewhale Way!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, best be quick about it,</ital>

<ital>you <name type="ORG">un</name>holy apparitions.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Whitewhale Way was developed</ital>

<ital>by Ezekiel Whitewhale,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>who started small with a modest petroleum</ital>

<ital>refinery he inherited from his father.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ollie]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>One day he looked aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d and said,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"Wait one minute!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>While I'm refining this oil, someone else</ital>

<ital>is getting rich drilling it,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and another someone's sellin' it</ital>

<ital>to the common commuter!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, he bought his own rig</ital>

<ital>and opened a chain of gas stations.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>By controlling both the means</ital>

<ital>of production and the delivery system,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ezekiel cornered the market</ital>

<ital>and choked out the competition</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="ORG">un</name>til they had no choice</ital>

<ital>but to sell to him, too!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And that's vertical integration! </ital>[burps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[giggles]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Pardon me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>F-f-f-f-fast-forward to the 1980s,</ital>

<line>
<ital>Well, I must have been a h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry whale</ital>

<ital>because I just kept gobbling up companies.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Fast-forward to today,</ital>

<ital>and it looks like I gobbled up you!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles]

-Are we supposed to be charmed by this?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Welcome to the Whitewhale family.</ital>

<ital>Everywhere you are, that's where we'll be.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Here's a list

of your new sister companies.

</line>


<line>
Please be mindful of them

as you spew your content. [sputters]

</line>


<line>
So we can't make videos

about any of these subsidiaries?

</line>


<line>
Monsanto, <name type="ORG">JP <name type="ORG">Morgan</name> Chase</name>,

Marie Osmond?

</line>


<line>
Oh! There it is,

<name type="ORG">the Every Animal Girl Company</name>.

</line>


<line>
You don't really think Whitewhale bought

<name type="ORG">Girl Croosh</name> just to kill our video?

</line>


<line>
And you couldn't just tell

a feel-good story about two friends

who started a business.

</line>


<line>
Maybe this is for the best.

</line>


<line>
You can get a new job in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>,

spend more time with your kid.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and you can go back to <name type="GPE">LA</name>,

where you won't have to borrow my coat

all the time.

</line>


<line>
-[giggles]

-Didn't you wanna write another book?

</line>


<line>
I have this book of essays

I've been brewing in my head.

</line>


<line>
It's called, <ital>One Last Thing</ital>

<ital>and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>About This Forever: Dispatches</ital>

<ital>from the Frontlines of the War on Women:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Arguments, Opinions, Reflections,</ital>

<ital>Recollections, The Razor Tax--</ital>

</line>


<line>
Is this still the title?

</line>


<line>
I kind of got lost in the middle

 and couldn't find a way out.

</line>


<line>
No, no, it's good,

</line>


<line>
I just think you want to save some of it

for the inside of the book.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I guess that's it for us,

though, right?

</line>


<line>
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
What if we did one more video

about anything we wanted

and posted it on the website before they 

realize we still have all the passwords?

</line>


<line>
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.

-Oh, yeah!

</line>


<line>
Now, there's a feel-good story.

</line>


<line>
Me feeling good about takin'

those assholes down!

</line>


<line>
Diane, this is Isabel,

star reporter at <ital><name type="ORG">The Trib<name type="ORG">un</name>e</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
She's been h<name type="ORG">un</name>ting Whitewhale for years.

</line>


<line>
-Call me... Isabel.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
All my days, the beast has ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted me.

</line>


<line>
The h<name type="ORG">un</name>t consumes my every waking moment.

</line>


<line>
You might even say Whitewhale is my...

green light at the end of the dock.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-That's a <ital>Gatsby</ital> reference. Read a book.

</line>


<line>
Isabel, be nice.

</line>


<line>
I wish I had the energy,

but my obsession has ruined me.

</line>


<line>
Destroyed my relationships,

obliterated my career. And for nothing.

</line>


<line>
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,

Matt Minnowman.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-Then he disappeared.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe there's your story.

-Not your story?

</line>


<line>
Mm. My editor thought I was getting

"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,

so he moved me

to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.

</line>


<line>
Now the search for the season's hot toy

torments my waking days.

</line>


<line>
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?

The answer eludes me at every turn.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane]</nonVerbComm> I can't believe it. We got a lead.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding? It's so cold.

How is it snowing in October?

</line>


<line>
There are basically two seasons here:

bitter winter, <name type="ORG">un</name>bearable humidity.

</line>


<line>
-You'll learn to love it.

-[giggles]

</line>


<line>
-[Diane gasping]

-[both giggling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack's voice]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Dear Diane, I'm sure you are dying to know</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>how this <name type="GPE">Beverly</name></ital>

<ital><name type="ORG">sec</name>ret admirer situation is going,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-so I'll cut right to the chase.</ital>

-[Guy] Oh!

</line>


<line>
<ital>I started writing "BH" on my snack kits</ital>

<ital>to clear up any confusion</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>about who the extra nuts are for.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But now <name type="GPE">Beverly</name> thinks "BH"</ital>

<ital>stands for <name type="GPE">Beverly</name>, here-ya-go.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"<name type="GPE">Beverly</name> here ya go"?</ital>

<ital>Why would the "H" stand for--</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Guy and Diane moan]

<ital>-You know what? Doesn't matter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The dumbest part is that <name type="GPE">Beverly</name> doesn't</ital>

<ital>even eat candied nuts.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Diane moaning]

<ital>-She's allergic.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So she usually just ends up</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-giving her nuts to me.</ital>

-[Guy snores]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Doctor Champ would probably say</ital>

<ital>that means something.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That the <name type="ORG">un</name>iverse has a way of looking out</ital>

<ital>for us if we just stop fighting it, but...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I don't know.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Anyway, I guess it's working.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Hope things are working</ital>

<ital>for you, too. BoJack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[keyboard clacking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Were you up all night?

</line>


<line>
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.

</line>


<line>
Turns out there was an "accident"

at the warehouse.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-He stayed late to finish some work.

</line>


<line>
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.

It's no big deal."

</line>


<line>
Next morning, they fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d him dead.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
This guy was trying to get the word out

about working conditions,

and then he died in the warehouse.

</line>


<line>
I got the names of some coworkers,

let's get our hands

on the <name type="ORG">sec</name>urity footage.

</line>


<line>
Did you know your cereal

was made by Whitewhale?

</line>


<line>
I threw it out to be safe.

</line>


<line>
Microchips-- Oh, my God,

you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

</line>


<line>
You think I'm obsessed.

Am I totally scaring you off right now?

</line>


<line>
No. You're glowing.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[keyboard clacking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We were working 17-hour days.

</line>


<line>
We were spread thinner

than a shitty <name type="GPE">New York</name> slice of pizza

and working harder than the '96 Bulls.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Guy]</nonVerbComm> Okay, so Matt's stationed here...

</line>


<line>
So, what, he walked to the other side

of the room just to die?

</line>


<line>
That's where he died, all right.

</line>


<line>
Management left his body out there

on the floor.

</line>


<line>
Almost like it was a warning

to the other workers.

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
I just don't think you can attribute it

to intentional cruelty.

</line>


<line>
-It's callousness.

-Can't it be both?

</line>


<line>
Whitewhale's not evil.

They're just capitalists.

</line>


<line>
What's the difference?

</line>


<line>
<ital>From</ital> <name type="GPE">New York</name> <name type="ORG">Time</name>s,

<ital>I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you

at the <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> Whitewhale building

tomorrow at 2:00.

</line>


<line>
Bring your camera. [sputters]

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit. If they know what we're doing,

why would they wanna talk to us?

</line>


<line>
I guess we'll find out.

</line>


<line>
I'm kind of weirdly excited.

</line>


<line>
-Hey. I got you something.

-What? Shut up!

</line>


<line>
-Huh.

-Ah.

</line>


<line>
-You don't like it.

-No, I love it.

</line>


<line>
It's just I won't get much use

out of a coat like this in <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
No. It's for here.

</line>


<line>
Is this your way of asking me

to move to <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> No. Not everything is some kind

of <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret <name type="ORG">un</name>derhanded conspiracy.

</line>


<line>
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
But I also don't know why it's so obvious

that you go back to <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I live there.

-But there's nothing for you there.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me?

</line>


<line>
I just don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why you're so into p<name type="ORG">un</name>ishing yourself.

</line>


<line>
I am not--

</line>


<line>
And it's not just yourself,

because every time you get cold,

</line>


<line>
-guess who has to give you his coat.

-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?

</line>


<line>
No. [sighs]

</line>


<line>
I just don't know

why I should suffer

because you have this ideological

objection to feeling good.

</line>


<line>
Are you-- I would love to feel good.

</line>


<line>
What a luxury. How nice for you

that you can do that

while the world burns aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d you.

</line>


<line>
This is not even about the world,

this is about you and me.

</line>


<line>
"You and me"?

What's "you and me"?

</line>


<line>
-Don't--

-No, no, tell me, Guy, please,

because I would love some clarification.

Am I your girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Am I the, um,

"you know, woman that I work with"?

</line>


<line>
-Come on, Diane.

-What is this?

</line>


<line>
I... Just take the coat.

</line>


<line>
I think I should go back to the hotel.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane shudders]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[birds chirping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I didn't know if you'd come.

</line>


<line>
Well, we got a job to do, right?

Could get chilly up there.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what kind of video

you're putting together,

but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.

</line>


<line>
You're not gonna stop us.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to stop you,

I just said that.

</line>


<line>
See, when you put out stories about us

being "evil" or "callous"

or whoever the bad guy in <ital>Harry Potter</ital> is,

people think our business is <name type="ORG">un</name>compromised

by morality and our stock goes up.

</line>


<line>
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders

that one of your employees died

in a work-related accident?

</line>


<line>
-What accident?

-Matt Minnowman's body was fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d

in your warehouse.

</line>


<line>
Oh, him, sure!

But that was no accident. I killed him.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I murdered him!

</line>


<line>
Like <ital>murdered</ital> murdered him?

</line>


<line>
Well, I didn't murder-of-crows him.

</line>


<line>
He took too many bathroom breaks

and encouraged the other employees

to take bathroom breaks as well.

</line>


<line>
And you're not worried it's going

to get out that you killed an employee?

</line>


<line>
Like in the video

we're shooting right now?

</line>


<line>
Didn't you hear? <name type="ORG">Congress</name> just passed

a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.

</line>


<line>
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!

-What?

</line>


<line>
Hold on. Just because it passed

the <name type="ORG">House</name> doesn't mean the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> will--

</line>


<line>
Really, Diane?

</line>


<line>
Okay, but the president could still veto--

</line>


<line>
Really, Diane?

</line>


<line>
All right, sure, but the Supreme <name type="ORG">Court</name>.

Okay, I get it.

</line>


<line>
Look, don't take it so hard.

</line>


<line>
If you wanna do something about it,

just make a billion dollars and murder me!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both cackle]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Barbara, let's make sure they get

a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag

</line>


<line>
-on their way out.

-[sputters]

</line>


<line>
Well, we can still post the video.

</line>


<line>
Why?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.

It's been real.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. It's been real.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna beg you to stay

if that's what you're waiting for.

</line>


<line>
I'm not waiting for anything.

</line>


<line>
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,

please don't go, I'm in love with you.

</line>


<line>
Stay here in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>

and write your book of essays

and come with me to baseball games.

</line>


<line>
They've got a pretty good theater scene

here and a big shiny bean and you could...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You could be so happy

in your warm winter coat."

</line>


<line>
-I don't need you to say--

-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?

</line>


<line>
But if you wanted to stay, I could

make things so good for you, Diane.

</line>


<line>
-Listen--

-No, no, I get it.

</line>


<line>
No, listen. Guy.

</line>


<line>
I feel so shitty all the time.

</line>


<line>
I feel like the whole world is pushing in

on me, except for when I'm with you.

</line>


<line>
You have been such a good thing for me.

</line>


<line>
But I can't be with you

if you're the only good thing in my life.

</line>


<line>
It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-Diane</name>! Don't get on that train!

-[scoffs]

</line>


<line>
-Guy, I just told you--

-I know, but you're going to the airport.

</line>


<line>
That train's going to <name type="GPE">Cottage <name type="LOC">Grove</name></name>,

you're gonna get screwed!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack's voice]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Dear Diane,</ital>

<ital>it was <name type="GPE">Beverly</name>'s last day yesterday.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Everyone is real excited for her,</ital>

<ital>but she spent the whole day sulking</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>because she never fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out</ital>

<ital>who her <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret admirer was.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,</ital>

<ital>so finally I just say,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"It was me! I'm in love with you!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And she goes,</ital>

<ital>"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And then she starts crying.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,</ital>

<ital>you made <name type="GPE">Beverly</name> cry on her last day."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, the thing I keep thinking about is...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>was it worth it for <name type="GPE">Beverly</name> to be happy</ital>

<ital>for a little bit,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>even though it ended up sad?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Or would it have been better</ital>

<ital>if the whole thing never happened?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Every time someone leaves rehab...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>it makes you think</ital>

<ital>about your own progress.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Some days it feels like you're not</ital>

<ital>progressing at all, other days you think,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"Well, maybe a little."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The main thing I think about</ital>

<ital>is how stupid I am</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that I didn't do this sooner.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I wasted so many years being miserable</ital>

<ital>because I assumed</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that was the only way to be.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But I don't wanna do that anymore.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Also, am I crazy or have I gotten</ital>

<ital>really good at writing letters?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is BoJack, by the way.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-[line ringing]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
I was thinking about these grilled cheese

sandwiches I used to make,

back when I first moved to <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I was dirt-broke,

and I had no friends and no job,

and I got obsessed with perfecting

the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.

</line>


<line>
-Makes sense.

-Partly because it was cheap,

but also because while I was doing it,

</line>


<line>
I wasn't thinking about how depressing

my life was.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
So, on the plane I was thinking,

</line>


<line>
I should make

another grilled cheese sandwich

because I haven't in a long time,

but I love them

and they always make me feel better

about things.

</line>


<line>
-Look, Diane, I gotta--

-And the thing about

making your own grilled cheese sandwich

is you can do it anywhere. You know?

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

So, I guess that's another good thing.
