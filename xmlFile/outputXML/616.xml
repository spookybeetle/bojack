<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, nothing's easy.

</line>


<line>
But I wouldn't be talking to you now

if I didn't believe

that it wasn't too late for us.

</line>


<line>
So what are we doing here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know about the rest of you,

but I'm here to put on the best

goddamn production of <ital><name type="PERSON">Hedda Gabler</name></ital>

this supermax prison has ever seen!

</line>


<line>
So let's take it back

to Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Elvsted</name>'s entrance,

</line>


<line>
and remember, if you're on stage,

I can see you, you're in character,

</line>


<line>
you have an opinion

about the return of Ejlert Løvborg.

</line>


<line>
-[guard clears throat]

-Oh, shit, is it 10:30 already?

</line>


<line>
Okay, look, guys, I gotta go,

but I'll be back tomorrow

and we'll pick up rehearsals <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nday.

</line>


<line>
If everyone could be off-book by then,

that would be phenomenal.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Schlesinger</name>,

if you have time to fashion a shiv

</line>


<line>
and or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>nize a jump on the rats

you have time to learn your lines, 'kay?

<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for picking me up.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he jury finds you guilty

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're extremely clever, can we go?

</line>


<line>
I sentence you to life...

filled with my friendship!

</line>


<line>
If this is my only other option,

I c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ose prison.

</line>


<line>
So you were just planning

on wearing this to the wedding?

</line>


<line>
Really leaning on that "optional"

in black tie optional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese are the clothes I went in with.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know

I'd be going to a wedding in a year.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why you always gotta pack

a spare suit, just in case.

</line>


<line>
-What are you in for a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

-Officially, breaking and entering,

but I think it was kind of for everything.

</line>


<line>
Ah, a little bit of everything.

</line>


<line>
Like the varied cuisine

at your favorite small plate

lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name> restaurant, right?

</line>


<line>
-Pardon?

-Do you have a favorite

establishment of that sort?

</line>


<line>
A favorite small plate

lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name> restaurant? Hell if I know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, it means so much

that you would say that.

</line>


<line>
I actually am a little h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry.

Where could we get l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ele</name>fino!

</line>


<line>
No? Oh, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w about the diner?

</line>


<line>
So, do you spend a lot of time

with them, as a couple?

</line>


<line>
Well, I see Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn a lot

at "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>" events.

</line>


<line>
E<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ys, Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>s,

Critic's C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice Awards, Peabody Awards.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Nobel Prize for <name type="PERSON">T</name>elevision

they created just for our s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
But <name type="GPE">Judah</name> usually stays <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me with <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I can't believe she's getting married.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it would be with you, huh?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it would be with nobody

because I wasted all her best years.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>urns out her best years are now.

</line>


<line>
Well, joke's on me.

I couldn't even waste the right years.

</line>


<line>
I'm s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>cked she could get me out

for the weekend.

</line>


<line>
-When are you getting out for real?

-Few months.

</line>


<line>
Wow. What are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do next?

Big plans post-big <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="ORG">Big <name type="PERSON">Mo</name><name type="PERSON">mm</name>a's</name> <name type="ORG">House</name></ital> reboot?

</line>


<line>
My main goal right now

is just not screwing up this weekend.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u won't screw it up.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure I'll find a way.

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Can you get me another suit?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be there?

</line>


<line>
Everyone's going to be there.

It's the party of the year.

</line>


<line>
I haven't talked to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane since, uh...

</line>


<line>
-What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

-Oh, I'm too busy with my s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se birthdays

aren't <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> dad themselves!

</line>


<line>
What is this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

</line>


<line>
Besides, I'm really trying to focus

on myself right now.

</line>


<line>
I had this breakthrough recently.

</line>


<line>
One day, in therapy, I just blurted out,

</line>


<line>
"Is my problem with women

any movie directed by <name type="PERSON">Christopher</name> Nolan?

</line>


<line>
Because, yes, women are involved,

but it's really never about the women.

</line>


<line>
It's about me."

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's actually somewhat astute.

-It occurred to me:

</line>


<line>
Are my self-destructive patterns

and <name type="ORG">un</name>examined cycles of co-dependency

the popular <name type="PERSON">Jim Carrey</name> character <name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>sk?

</line>


<line>
Because "somebody stop me"!

</line>


<line>
Are all of your breakthroughs

phrased like that?

</line>


<line>
Um, are all of my breakthroughs a <name type="NORP">British</name>

prog-rock band from the '70s?

</line>


<line>
-Because yes.

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
W-What are we doing here?

Is this where the wedding is?

</line>


<line>
-I just have to make a real quick stop.

-At the <name type="PERSON">Griffith</name> Observatory?

</line>


<line>
-I have a press event.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u took me to a press event?

</line>


<line>
It was on the way.

</line>


<line>
Ah! No. What do you... I can't be here.

</line>


<line>
-It'll take 15 minutes, 20 tops.

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
Definitely not more

than two and a half <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Hello, everybody!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u all know and love me

as the titular Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.

</line>


<line>
I've also been known for other roles:

Sad Dog, fracking advocate,

finder-outer of what

<name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo stars and celebrities know

and whether they know things,

but some of you might remember me

as the notorious Stealer of the "D"!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ooh!

</line>


<line>
Now, to celebrate the success

of "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>,"

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it was time

I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve a birthday present back!

</line>


<line>
I called up my favorite sign company

and said,

</line>


<line>
"I wanna give this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le town the 'D'!

</line>


<line>
'D' for <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.

</line>


<line>
'Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>,' that is!"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Yay!

</line>


<line>
So, wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut further a-dad,

let's say goodbye

to the era of <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo forever,

and say hello to...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Holly</name>... woob?

-[all <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
No, I said "D" as in "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

</line>


<line>
No, obviously I meant the "<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>" part

of "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>,"

</line>


<line>
I assumed that went wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut saying.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I gotta go,

but the next time I need a sign made

</line>


<line>
I'm going to strongly consider

going with a different company.

</line>


<line>
Okay, next stop: wedding!

</line>


<line>
I'm not ready for this.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta take me back to jail.

</line>


<line>
What? Come on, <name type="PERSON">Shawshank</name>,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be fine.

</line>


<line>
No, I can't be aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d people.

I can't face them, I'm not ready.

</line>


<line>
-What do you think is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen?

-I don't know! I never know.

</line>


<line>
I just know that something bad

is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen

if I go to that wedding.

</line>


<line>
How about this? We'll go to the wedding

and if you get there

and you wanna leave, we can leave.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
And if you wanna stay,

I'll stay there with you.

</line>


<line>
I will not leave your side.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure?

-Of course.

</line>


<line>
I'm here for you, buddy. No matter what.

</line>


<line>
Unless I see my good friend <name type="PERSON">Eric</name>a

and get distracted

by some noteworthy aspect

of her character or presentation,

but, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

what are the odds that would...

in ten minutes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no time to explain.

</line>


<line>
We need to go down to the beach

so I can sit on your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ulders!

</line>


<line>
-What? Why?

-I just said there's no time to explain!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you go to jail

for being a bad listener?

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> So...

why did we need to be on the beach?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you just seemed

really overwhelmed at the party.

</line>


<line>
-I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you could use some air.

-Oh. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks.

</line>


<line>
But then why are you on my s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ulders?

</line>


<line>
So I could get

a better view of the fireworks.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, get down. Oh, okay.

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]

</line>


<line>
It's good to see you.

</line>


<line>
How'd you get out of the supermax?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d a helicopter crash

into the side of the building

and then you just walked out?

</line>


<line>
What? No. I'm just here for the wedding.

I'm going back tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Oh, bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er.

</line>


<line>
No, it's good.

I think the routine is good for me.

</line>


<line>
-I'm staying out of trouble, at least.

-<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>! Staying out of trouble, at least!

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to set little goals for myself.

</line>


<line>
Like, in a couple months,

I'll beat my record for being sober.

</line>


<line>
-Nice!

-Yeah, so that's...

that's something to aim for,

but then, uh, after that, um...

</line>


<line>
After that, you'll beat your record a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Every day, you'll set a new record.

</line>


<line>
Sure. But it's easy now. In jail.

</line>


<line>
I don't have to

make any c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ices for myself.

</line>


<line>
I worry about what's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen

when I get out.

</line>


<line>
-What if I relapse a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen you'll get sober a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-Let me tell you something.

</line>


<line>
I was at the office the other day,

doing the "Hokey Pokey"

with some work associates...

</line>


<line>
-Uh-huh.

-...and I realized

everyone mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstands that song.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Hokey Pokey"?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, there's way too much emphasis

on the "<name type="PERSON">ho</name>key pokey" part.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is what it's all about.

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's exactly what I mean.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not what the song is saying.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
And I was thinking about my mom,

you know, my relationship with my mom.

</line>


<line>
It's weird. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, awkward.

</line>


<line>
I feel like she doesn't really get me,

but, you know, she's trying.

</line>


<line>
And a couple years ago,

</line>


<line>
I never t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught I would have

any kind of relationship with her.

</line>


<line>
Like, I was sure of it.

</line>


<line>
What changed?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I did? Or-- Or she did?

</line>


<line>
Or, um, we... are?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

-So, that's what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
It's like the song says.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name> do the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>key pokey

and you turn yourself aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u turn yourself aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what it's all about.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters

put that much t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

into the existential significance

of the lyrics.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey literally rhyme "about" with "about."

</line>


<line>
But isn't the point of art

less what people put into it

and more what people get out of it?

</line>


<line>
-Is that the point of art?

-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe that's why it's called art.

</line>


<line>
I can't tell

if you're being smart or stupid.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I never know.

</line>


<line>
I think you had it for a moment

and then you lost it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Hey, there he is!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

that was an incredible wedding.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? It wasn't too much

with the fireworks,

and the cirque performers,

and the procession of exotic peafowl?

</line>


<line>
No, you produced the hell out of it.

</line>


<line>
What'd you think about the part

where the priest got murdered

and <name type="GPE">Judah</name> had to figure out

which bridesmaid was the culprit?

</line>


<line>
A little outside the box,

as far as weddings go,

but it worked in context.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught so, too!

</line>


<line>
Congratulations.

And <name type="GPE">Judah</name>, too. Where is he?

</line>


<line>
I think he's going over some contracts.

</line>


<line>
We're putting together

an all-female reboot

of <ital>12 <name type="ORG">Angry Men</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's called "11 Angry Women."

</line>


<line>
-Not 12?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta leave room for a sequel.

<line>
So your groom is doing paperwork

during his own wedding reception?

</line>


<line>
Oh, we had our real wedding a week ago.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his one's just for the industry.

<line>
-What?

-I invited the town's top talent,

took away their p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>nes,

and shuffled them together.

</line>


<line>
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty,

next day, they're calling me,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, could you put me in touch

with so-and-so?"

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>om! I've attached myself as a producer!

-Does that really work?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Jennifer Jason Leigh</name>!

Have you met regular Jason <name type="PERSON">Lee</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're my two favorite <name type="PERSON">Jason <name type="PERSON">Lee</name>s</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>scuss.

</line>


<line>
Well, I am offended I wasn't

important enough for your real wedding,

but I'm flattered I'm important enough

for your industry one.

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

"Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-All of <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woob

is buzzing about your comeback.

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you say "<name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woob"?

</line>


<line>
If this movie does what it's supposed to,

the district attorney's not the only one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> wanna lock you into something.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure

I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld take on more projects.

</line>


<line>
I started this drama program at prison

and we're doing <ital><name type="PERSON">Hedda Gabler</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's not <name type="PERSON">Strindberg</name>,

but, you know, we're having a good time.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught that maybe when I got out,

I could go back and vol<name type="ORG">un</name>teer.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Well, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds fabulous!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but... [sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers] I didn't even

think that I'd have other options.

</line>


<line>
A year ago,

everyone in this town hated me.

</line>


<line>
People have s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt memories.

</line>


<line>
It's the best and worst thing

about people.

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both?

</line>


<line>
-I've really enjoyed teaching.

-Oh! Oh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe I could direct something?

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry I said anything. I--

-Well, I mean, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld on.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't

just jump into something,

but if there's a good opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity,

I'd be stupid not to take it, right?

</line>


<line>
I mean, we both know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard it is

to get heat in this town.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hink it over.

I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

</line>


<line>
Well, a decision.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[soft music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, you wanna dance?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Oh! Aw.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both chuckle]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I had this weird idea

when I heard you were getting married

that I'd get here

and there'd be some disaster,

and I knew that either I would cause it

or, just maybe,

</line>


<line>
I would be the only one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> could fix it.

</line>


<line>
A disaster, huh?

</line>


<line>
Not like a "disaster" disaster,

like a sitcom disaster, you know?

</line>


<line>
Like, it would be time for the wedding

and no one would know where to find you.

</line>


<line>
-No one but you, right?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
And I'd find you in some special spot

and I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go."

</line>


<line>
And you'd say,

"What am I doing, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> And then what,

I'd r<name type="ORG">un</name> off with you?

</line>


<line>
No, I would talk you

into going through with it,

and it would be like a symbol

of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much I'd grown,

that I could let you go.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

</line>


<line>
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.

</line>


<line>
Just... it's a better story

if you had cold feet.

</line>


<line>
It's a better story for you.

I think I like it better this way.

</line>


<line>
I guess you're right.

</line>


<line>
What would you have said to me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know. I would have said, uh,

</line>


<line>
-"Come on, man. Do it."

-[chuckles] Oh, wow.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no. I would-- Okay. Hold on.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me what you're afraid of.

</line>


<line>
In this make-believe scenario

that you came up with?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess I'm afraid

of losing some part of myself.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid that if I let someone else

take care of me

that I'm not really me anymore.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable,

you know, going soft.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid that this could be

the best thing that ever happened to me

and if it doesn't make me

as happy as I'm supposed to be,

that means I'm a lost cause.

</line>


<line>
-Holy shit.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se are some really good arguments.

</line>


<line>
-Are you kidding me?!

-Okay, okay, look.

</line>


<line>
Yes, all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se things could be true,

but on the other hand,

what if you deserve to be happy

and this is a thing

that will make you happy?

</line>


<line>
And maybe don't worry

about whether you'll be happy later

and just focus

on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you're happy right now?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, is it that easy?

-No.

</line>


<line>
But you're here because, at some point,

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

this was a good idea.

</line>


<line>
And I think we oughta listen to her.

</line>


<line>
Because she's the smartest woman I know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's true. She is.

</line>


<line>
So, what do you think?

Are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> marry him?

</line>


<line>
Well, I already got the dress.

</line>


<line>
But you didn't need me

to say any of that, did you?

</line>


<line>
I guess I didn't.

</line>


<line>
Hey, if I do decide

to get back into the business

when I get out of prison...

</line>


<line>
I mean, I probably won't, but if I do,

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> need representation.

</line>


<line>
Someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can look out for me,

help me make the right decisions,

keep me out of trouble...

</line>


<line>
I can reco<name type="PERSON">mm</name>end some excellent people.

<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught I might find you here.

-I'm trying to quit.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you look like

you're trying really hard.

</line>


<line>
Don't be shitty.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen you in a while.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u doing okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

</line>


<line>
-I mean, you know, okay.

-Sure.

</line>


<line>
I'm working

on this middle-grade fiction series.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I mean, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> am I, <name type="PERSON">Rick</name> Riordan?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Rick</name> Riordan?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, good point.

What have you been up to?

</line>


<line>
Well, let's see, um,

I've been getting into podcasts,

went through a Sudoku phase, and, uh,

</line>


<line>
-oh, I'm in prison, so...

-Right. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's still happening?

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's very much happening.

I've also got a new movie coming out.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, with <name type="PERSON">Vance</name> <name type="PERSON">Waggoner</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
I know what you're thinking, but he's--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't need to explain yourself to me.

</line>


<line>
I know you think

I'm some kind of a sell-out,

but it wasn't like other opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ities

were banging down my door...

</line>


<line>
-I'm not arguing with you.

-Because of "Horny Unicorn<name type="PERSON">"-</name>-

</line>


<line>
I'm not going to help you work through

whatever you're trying to work through.

</line>


<line>
I just came out here to smoke.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u came to me.

</line>


<line>
-Because I wanted to talk to you.

-About what? "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Horny Unicorn"?

</line>


<line>
No, about-- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to talk to you.

[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers] I miss talking to you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[ci<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rette sizzles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I wish I had my p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne right now.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know what you mean.

</line>


<line>
I never know what to do

with my hands at parties.

</line>


<line>
No, I wish I had my p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne

so I could play you

the last voicemail you left me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you remember that,

that you left me a voicemail?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[inhales]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ooh.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were sober.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told me you were sober.

</line>


<line>
And things were good in my life

and I was thinking about my future,

and then I woke up one morning

and I had this voicemail.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I-I wasn't in the--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were happy on the voicemail.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u so<name type="ORG">un</name>ded happy.

</line>


<line>
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic,

or <name type="PERSON">ho</name>wever you'd describe

that thing you get

that's the closest to the emotion

normal people call happy.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry--

-And you were clearly intoxicated,

and you were talking about swi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing.

"I'm going swi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing," you said.

</line>


<line>
"Since nothing matters anyway,

and nobody cares about me,

</line>


<line>
-I might as well go swi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing, right?"

-I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
"Call me back

if you don't want me to go swi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise, I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> assume

you don't care."

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were dead.

</line>


<line>
For seven <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs,

I couldn't get in touch with anyone

and I was sure you were dead,

and it was my fault for leaving you,

for feeling good, for not worrying.

</line>


<line>
When I left for <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>,

you promised me you were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay,

but I made you promise me that.

</line>


<line>
-Was I selfish for believing you?

-No.

</line>


<line>
Why did you call me?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u knew I was in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I was dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

and-- and I was high.

</line>


<line>
And I just... I wanted to talk to you.

</line>


<line>
When I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out you weren't dead,

I was angry.

</line>


<line>
I was relieved, but I was also angry

that I'd given you that power over me.

</line>


<line>
I was angry at you for a really long time.

</line>


<line>
Are you still angry at me?

</line>


<line>
No. I don't know.

What good has being angry at you

</line>


<line>
-ever done for me?

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I wish I could have been

the person you t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught I was,

</line>


<line>
-the person w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> would save you.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was never your job.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen why did you always make me

feel like it was?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, maybe it's everybody's job

to save each other.

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.

</line>


<line>
I am, too.

</line>


<line>
So, you're still in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>, then, or...?

</line>


<line>
When I got that voicemail,

my boyfriend at the time

wanted me to move to <name type="GPE">Houston</name> with him.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to move with him.

</line>


<line>
But after you called, I got scared.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no.

-I didn't trust myself.

</line>


<line>
I was happy and I didn't trust that.

So I stayed in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

</line>


<line>
We tried to make it work long distance,

but it was hard.

</line>


<line>
Eventually, I just t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is stupid."

</line>


<line>
So, what, you broke up with him?

</line>


<line>
No. I moved to <name type="GPE">Houston</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o be with your boyfriend at the time?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Plus, the winters in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>

are cold as shit,

</line>


<line>
I don't know why anyone

would build a city there.

</line>


<line>
No wonder that cow started that fire.

</line>


<line>
I get it. I'm on <name type="PERSON">T</name>eam Cow.

</line>


<line>
But your boyfriend at the time,

he's not your boyfriend anymore?

</line>


<line>
He is not.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
How'd you learn <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to trust it?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he happiness?

</line>


<line>
I didn't. But I trust him.

</line>


<line>
It's hard to imagine you in <name type="GPE">Houston</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm like

a totally different person now.

</line>


<line>
-Are you?

-No?

</line>


<line>
Yes? I wear fewer <name type="PERSON">jack</name>ets.

I smile more.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes I look back at my <name type="GPE">LA</name> years,

and I think, <name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> was that person?"

</line>


<line>
Does she ever come back, that <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

</line>


<line>
Sometimes.

</line>


<line>
I felt her when I got back to <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.

</line>


<line>
But it's not you?

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's all me.

</line>


<line>
I'd love to say,

"No, she's gone forever."

</line>


<line>
But I was terrified

of coming back here for the wedding.

</line>


<line>
<name type="NORP">-Seeing</name> Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter. Seeing you.

-What'd you think was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I would spin out,

start questioning everything,

blow everything up.

</line>


<line>
But that didn't happen, did it?

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat didn't happen.

</line>


<line>
But was part of you

kinda <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping that it would?

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u ever miss the mess?

</line>


<line>
No, "miss" is the wrong word.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I lived in <name type="GPE">LA</name>,

but I'm not nostalgic for it.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I knew Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

</line>


<line>
-even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh he's not in my life anymore.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
I think there are people that help you

become the person that you end up being,

and you can be grateful for them

even if they were never

meant to be in your life forever.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I knew you, too.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"Knew</name>," huh?

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>


<line>
Hey, wouldn't it be f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny

if this night was the last time

we ever talked to each other?

</line>


<line>
-Um, anyway, I--

-I need to tell you...

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to--

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't owe me anything.

</line>


<line>
No, I need to tell you: <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
And it's going to be okay.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
And... [softly] thank you.

</line>


<line>
-Wait.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
I know. I know.

But can I just tell you a f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny story?

</line>


<line>
Sure.

</line>


<line>
But it better be very f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna lie to you,

it's only kind of f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
So we have this movie night

at the prison, right?

</line>


<line>
And we get to vote

on what movies we wanna see.

</line>


<line>
But of course the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing's rigged,

because Big <name type="PERSON">Andy</name>'s favorite movie

is <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Family <name type="PERSON">Stone</name>,</ital>

so Big <name type="PERSON">Andy</name> gets his guys

to vote for it every week,

and so every week

we watch <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Family <name type="PERSON">Stone</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hold on, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se favorite movie

is <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Family <name type="PERSON">Stone</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I mean, yeah, it's a fine movie...

</line>


<line>
-But every week?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I'm saying!

</line>


<line>
So, one day I'm like, "If I see

<name type="PERSON">Luke Wilson</name> teach <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Parker

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to let her freak flag fly

one more time, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> snap."

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand,

is movie night mandatory?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-So why don't you just not go?

</line>


<line>
What am I, a philistine?

I support the arts, sue me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, sorry.

</line>


<line>
But I know a guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> vol<name type="ORG">un</name>teers in the library,

which is where they keep the D<name type="PERSON">VD</name>s,

so I make a deal with him.

</line>


<line>
"I'll give you my <name type="ORG">Jell-O</name> for a month

if <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Family <name type="PERSON">Stone</name></ital> goes missing."

</line>


<line>
I feel like this doesn't end well.

</line>


<line>
So, movie might comes aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

time for another Christmas in <name type="GPE">Connecticut</name>,

but then, uh-oh, the D<name type="PERSON">VD</name>'s gone,

what do we do?

</line>


<line>
So Big <name type="PERSON">Andy</name>'s getting really upset,

and his guys are all riled,

and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas!

</line>


<line>
Why don't we watch

<ital>Pieces of April </ital>this week?

</line>


<line>
Change of pace.

<name type="PERSON">Patricia Clarkson's</name> in it and..."

</line>


<line>
And?

</line>


<line>
-Prison riot.

-Oh, shit, really?

</line>


<line>
No. Worse. Big <name type="PERSON">Andy</name> falls in love

with <ital>Pieces of April,</ital>

so now we watch<ital> Pieces of April</ital>

every week.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u kind of made your own bed

on that one.

</line>


<line>
Story of my life.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds awful.

</line>
