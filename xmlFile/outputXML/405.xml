<line>
Oh, no. No, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

</line>


<line>
Sorry to interrupt your l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch,

but there was another mass shooting.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God, where?

</line>


<line>
A town outside <name type="GPE">Tampa</name> called--

</line>


<line>
Not geographically, dipshit.

What's the location?

</line>


<line>
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

</line>


<line>
-It was a shopping mall.

-No!

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Ms. Taken</ital> is coming out next month.

-I know, sir.

</line>


<line>
The whole third act

revolves aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney <name type="ORG">Portnoy</name>

shooting people in a mall.

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do now,

not release the movie?

</line>


<line>
I hope it doesn't come to that.

</line>


<line>
I am sick and tired

of real-life g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence

getting in the way of us telling stories

that glamorize g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence.

</line>


<line>
Why does this keep happening?

Has the whole world gone crazy?

</line>


<line>
No, we've just been conditioned

by a rugged individualist culture

woven into the savage architecture

of our co<name type="ORG">un</name>try itself,

birthed as it was

through violent uprising,

but perhaps popularized

in the modern imagination by stories of--

</line>


<line>
Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,

</line>


<line>
I'll staple a string to your back

and then yank it.

</line>


<line>
Why not make yourself useful

and schedule a sit-down

with <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney <name type="ORG">Portnoy</name>'s team

to talk about how we distance ourselves

from this <ital>fakakte mishegoss.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Got it.

Except for the <name type="GPE">foccacia</name><ital> </ital><name type="GPE">Michigan</name> part.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Excuse me, could you point me</ital>

<ital>in the direction of an H&amp;M?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sure. But when you get there,</ital>

<ital>you're gonna be DOA.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Uh-uh. You picked the wrong shopaholic</ital>

<ital>to mess with.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Because this shopaholic's</ital>

<ital>also a holic for revenge.</ital>

<line>
-Wow. Carla <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benzbrown.

-Yep.

</line>


<line>
-My mother.

-That's right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I lied!

-What?

</line>


<line>
There's no Carla <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benzbrown.

</line>


<line>
-I have no idea who your mother is.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to have a relationship

lying to each other.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so why did you lie to me?

</line>


<line>
I meant everything else I said.

</line>


<line>
I'll do everything I can

to help find your mom.

</line>


<line>
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.

</line>


<line>
In fact, in my experience,

they're soulless succubi

</line>


<line>
born fully formed from the ass of Satan.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my grandmother

so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like quite a character.

</line>


<line>
-Can I meet her?

-Oh, my mom?

</line>


<line>
No, you cannot meet my mom

because she's... dead.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Dead mom.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, what happened

to the fudgesicles I bought?

</line>


<line>
-I lied again. My mom's not dead.

-Stop lying to me!

</line>


<line>
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.

Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.

</line>


<line>
I do. Where does she live?

</line>


<line>
Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,

</line>


<line>
she has her own private room

with a nice view,

</line>


<line>
'ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d-the-clock medical care,

</line>


<line>
and plenty of other seniors

to say casually cruel things to

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">un</name>der a passive-aggressive veil

of plausible deniability.

</line>


<line>
What's this place called?

</line>


<line>
I want to say Whispering Pines.

Whistling Pines?

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
Something with a W. Winter's Bone?

</line>


<line>
-Take me there.

-[groans] Fine!

</line>


<line>
-For real this time?

-Yes. I promise.

</line>


<line>
I am not gonna lie to you ever again.

</line>


<line>
-Did you eat the last fudgesicle?

-No.

</line>


<line>
I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle.

</line>


<line>

<line>
<ital>All this time you thought</ital>

<ital>I was just another damsel in distress,</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>but I'm afraid you were mis... guided.</ital>

-[screaming]

</line>


<line>
Oh... oh.

</line>


<line>
-[groans] That is not good.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Everybody set a <name type="ORG">Google</name> Alert

for "mass shooting."

</line>


<line>
Can't keep getting caught

off guard.

</line>


<line>
This is so sad.

</line>


<line>
You always hear about mass shootings

affecting other people's movie openings,

but you never think they're gonna

affect <ital>your </ital>movie opening. [sobs]

</line>


<line>
My thoughts and prayers

to the victims and their families.

</line>


<line>
-Of course. Yeah, thoughts and prayers.

-Thoughts and prayers.

</line>


<line>
Tragedy like this

really puts things in perspective.

</line>


<line>
Like, what are we doing

sitting in a conference room?

</line>


<line>
Life is short. We should have

this meeting at a water park.

</line>


<line>
Whoa! A water park

where people have meetings.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe that's the movie.

-I'm sorry, who is this schmuck?

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney's asexual fake fianc√©.

</line>


<line>
He's a common person/supermodel,

being engaged to him makes me appear

more approachable/glamorous.

</line>


<line>
Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time

to cut the mall shootout from the film.

</line>


<line>
That still leaves

the movie theater shootout,

</line>


<line>
-the shootout at the co<name type="ORG">un</name>ty fair, the--

-[vibrations and buzzing]

</line>


<line>
We should probably lose

the movie theater shootout.

</line>


<line>
Right. Well, we still have

the co<name type="ORG">un</name>ty fair shootout.

</line>


<line>
-[vibrations and buzzing]

-Oh, dear.

</line>


<line>
-This is a sad day.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>BoJack?</ital>

-Hi.

</line>


<line>
-Where have you been?

<ital>-Listen.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

I was an awful boyfriend to you.

</line>


<line>
I was an awful client,

and I was an awful friend.

</line>


<line>
This last year I spent some time away

and it made me realize

how special the people in my life are.

</line>


<line>
<ital>And you might be</ital>

<ital>the most special of them all.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wow, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

I-- I appreciate that.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

do you remember the name

of that super nice elder care facility

that we both agreed was the best place

for my mom to r<name type="ORG">un</name> out the clock?

</line>


<line>
Oh, pluck a duck.

It's called <name type="GPE">Walnut Springs</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Walnut Springs</name>!

I knew there was a W in there. Bye!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[ringing]

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I feel like I didn't strike the right tone

in the last phone call.

</line>


<line>
I really am sorry,

and the most important thing is,

you know how dedicated I am

to making things right again.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

turns out there's a few <name type="GPE">Walnut Springs</name>es

in the <name type="GPE">SoCal</name> area.

</line>


<line>
It's the one in <name type="GPE">Santa Barbara</name>, dummy!

</line>


<line>
-Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died?

-A lotta people!

</line>


<line>
-[panting]

-Sorry, what did I miss?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Court</name>ney's beloved was outlining his plan

to curtail g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying,

if people have the right pumped-up kicks,

maybe they can outr<name type="ORG">un</name> the bullets.

</line>


<line>
All this talk of g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence

is depressing.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Ms. Taken </ital>is a movie about empowerment.

-That's what I've been saying!

</line>


<line>
It's <ital>Bridget Jones</ital>

with slightly more bloody murdering.

</line>


<line>
We just have to keep the story

on <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney,

and not on the depressingly

<name type="ORG">un</name>stoppable rise

of real-life g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence in this co<name type="ORG">un</name>try,

thoughts and prayers.

</line>


<line>
-Thoughts and prayers.

-Hello?

<name type="ORG">-Diane</name>!

</line>


<line>
I got an exclusive for you.

</line>


<line>
You are going to write a glowing feature

about my client and her new movie.

</line>


<line>
-Why would I...

-You know <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney <name type="ORG">Portnoy</name>.

</line>


<line>
You probably recall when she soared

as the thorny horticulturist

in <ital>One Sordid Fortnight</ital>

<ital>With the Short-Skirted Sorceress.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-How would you enjoy joining <name type="ORG">Portnoy</name>

for a scorched soy porterhouse pork

four-courser at Koi?

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what?

-Glorify your source,

but don't make it feel forced, of course,

and try the borscht. Smooches!

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Hey--</ital>

-And that's how you do it, folks.

</line>


<line>
Oh... [gasps]

</line>


<line>
You're telling me

you didn't feel one twinge of guilt

when you left your mom in this place?

</line>


<line>
Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt,

trying to remember, no.

</line>


<line>
-Definitely not.

-Damn.

</line>


<line>
You didn't know my mom.

</line>


<line>
Football?

You don't have the ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ches for it.

</line>


<line>
You'll only embarrass yourself,

as in every other endeavor you pursue.

</line>


<line>
-But, Mom...

-If you're looking to get knocked aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

for an afternoon, why don't you just read

one of your father's manuscripts

and tell him his prose

is pedestrian and derivative?

Works for me every time.

<nonVerbComm>[inhales and puffs]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
Mrs. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man, you have a visitor.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hi, Mom.

-Do I know you?

</line>


<line>
Here we go.

Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>?

-Okay, we're doing this?

</line>


<line>
I think she really doesn't know

who you are.

</line>


<line>
She knows.

This is just like when she pretended

not to recognize me

after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

</line>


<line>
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

who liked to tickle a lot more

than just the ivories.

</line>


<line>
When I made it home <name type="ORG">un</name>scathed, she said,

"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, could I trouble you

for some orange juice, please?

</line>


<line>
Stop calling me <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>!

Nobody here's named <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>!

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, orange juice. Now!

</line>


<line>
You're not being paid

for polite conversation.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, maybe you should just--

-Oh, hello! It's you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>.

</line>


<line>
I must apologize for <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>.

She learned to read on <name type="ORG">sec</name>ondhand books.

</line>


<line>
Mom, do you really not know who I am?

Me, famous BoJack?

</line>


<line>
If you are getting orange juice,

I'd love a glass too.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
So you see

I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you put your pants on

one leg at a time.

</line>


<line>
Well, I step into my pants

one leg at a time,

then my trouser-maidens lift the legs

simultaneously to avoid <name type="ORG">wrinklage</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, right, of course,

why else have trouser-maidens?

</line>


<line>
-Hey.<ital> <name type="GPE">Konichiwa</name>, </ital>Princess Mulan.

-Just leave us alone, okay?

</line>


<line>
I was giving you a compliment.

</line>


<line>
First, <ital><name type="GPE">konichiwa</name> </ital>is not a compliment,

it's <name type="GPE">Japan</name>ese for hello.

</line>


<line>
Second, I'm not <name type="GPE">Japan</name>ese.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I could put something

in that sweet mouth of yours

</line>


<line>
-so you don't have to talk so much.

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
One more step, asshole.

</line>


<line>
-What...

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
I was joking.

I don't want any trouble.

</line>


<line>
-Tell your story walking.

-...the...

shit was that?

</line>


<line>
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.

</line>


<line>
Why do you even have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Well, using it in the movie

was so empowering,

and now I just carry it everywhere.

Do you want to hold it?

</line>


<line>
No, I am very anti-g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
In fact, I think the whole idea of g<name type="ORG">un</name>s

is inherently--

</line>


<line>
Holy shit, I'm holding a g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

How long has this been in my hand?

</line>


<line>
-Slides right in, doesn't it?

-It actually feels kind of nice.

</line>


<line>
Would you like to try shooting it?

We can go to my g<name type="ORG">un</name> range.

</line>


<line>
You have your own g<name type="ORG">un</name> range?

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="ORG">Court</name>ney <name type="ORG">Portnoy</name>.

I have all the things.

<nonVerbComm>[clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[breathless gasp]</nonVerbComm> Whoa...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Bea]</nonVerbComm> I can't believe you came back.

</line>


<line>
-Who, me? Or BoJack?

-You look just like him.

</line>


<line>
-People tell me that.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Your mother's <name type="NORP">dem</name>entia

is progressing rapidly.

</line>


<line>
-You came out of nowhere.

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol

for the alarming creep of <name type="NORP">dem</name>entia.

</line>


<line>
-It isn't there, <name type="ORG">un</name>til it is.

-Thank you, very colorful.

</line>


<line>
We tried to call you,

but the number you gave us

</line>


<line>
-connected to a sandwich shop in <name type="GPE">Temecula</name>.

-Is that right?

</line>


<line>
This is the most responsive

she's been in weeks.

</line>


<line>
I think with regular visits

from you and your daughter--

</line>


<line>
That's not happening.

</line>


<line>
Seeing my mom

is like a Terrence Malick movie.

</line>


<line>
Every ten years or so is bearable,

but more than that

and it starts to get annoying.

</line>


<line>
She won't last another ten years.

</line>


<line>
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>,

let's blow this <name type="ORG">Jell-O</name> stand.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna come back though, right?

</line>


<line>
We can't just leave her like this.

</line>


<line>
You can do anything

if you believe in yourself.

</line>


<line>
-We have to come back.

-[Bea] <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Every week.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
Because she's your mother

and <name type="NORP">dem</name>entia is hereditary.

</line>


<line>
One day, you're gonna be

in a home like this, and so will I,

and wouldn't you want

someone visiting you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Fine.

We'll come back. Happy?

Great. Also, real quick follow-up,

why are you holding a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God!

</line>


<line>
Did I drive all the way home

without realizing I was holding a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
No wonder that guy at the gas station

didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Did I rob a gas station?

</line>


<line>
Classic Diane shenanigans.

</line>


<line>
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."

Yup, she sure remembers

all the important people.

That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

Thirty <name type="ORG">sec</name>onds

after that picture was taken

you yelled at me

for getting ice cream on my shorts.

</line>


<line>
No ice cream for me, <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>.

I'm watching my figure.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you want to look pretty

for when Death comes to visit.

</line>


<line>
Beth? No.

</line>


<line>
We stopped talking

after she wouldn't eat my casserole

and then I told the whole supper club

that her son was a gay.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh.

-Okay. You two enjoy each other.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go see

if I can seduce a lonely dowager

into giving me her night-night pills.

</line>


<line>
Wow. Is this you?

</line>


<line>
-[Bea] This is me at my debutante ball.

-You were so beautiful.

<line>
You could be thin, too.

Just go easy on the sweets

and when you go somewhere,

Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Morning time, <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

</line>


<line>
And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

</line>


<line>
Here's something

I'm just now reading on a cue card.

</line>


<line>
All the ladies

are getting concealed carry permits.

</line>


<line>
It's the newest thing.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't want to be aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

one of those ladies

at a certain time of the month,

if you know what I mean.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> I don't.

</line>


<line>
Joking aside, I think it's great

these gals have a hobby.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers

that we have a breaking news alert--

</line>


<line>
-there has been another mass shooting.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
I am totally <name type="ORG">un</name>qualified

to cover a news story this important.

</line>


<line>
But as a straight white male,

I will plow forward with confidence

and assume I'm doing fine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Again with the crazy g<name type="ORG">un</name>men.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

we're gonna have to put this movie

on the shelf

next to that wacky vacation comedy we did

about the klutzy babysitter.

</line>


<line>
-[Todd] <ital>Ha! That so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds hilarious!</ital>

-What the hell are you doing on this call?

</line>


<line>
Imagining that f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny movie

you just described.

</line>


<line>
Okay, what do all these shootings

have in common?

</line>


<line>
G<name type="ORG">un</name>s? Bullets? Who are you,

Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

</line>


<line>
Men! What if we played up

the "Ms." in <ital>Ms. Taken</ital>?

</line>


<line>
In a world of increasing terror,

our movie tells women

they don't have to be afraid anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, now you're talking.

-When you put it that way,

it almost so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like these mass shootings

could be a good thing for the movie.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, of course not.

They're a terrible tragedy.

</line>


<line>
Thoughts and prayers

are with the victims.

</line>


<line>
-Right, thoughts and prayers.

-But...

anything that makes women feel <name type="ORG">un</name>safe

might actually help our box office.

</line>


<line>
But you don't want women to feel <name type="ORG">un</name>safe.

</line>


<line>
Of course not!

</line>


<line>
Nobody wants that,

nobody's saying that.

</line>


<line>
But if they already <ital>do</ital> feel <name type="ORG">un</name>safe,

there's no reason not to capitalize.

</line>


<line>
Right, if they already feel <name type="ORG">un</name>safe anyway.

</line>


<line>
Exactly, we're not making them

feel <name type="ORG">un</name>safe.

</line>


<line>
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,

from there being more mass shootings.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
In that case,

I got good news and I got bad news.

</line>


<line>
Bad news is

you're gonna want to avoid the 405.

</line>


<line>
-Ta-da!

-Ugh! Keep it down.

</line>


<line>
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

</line>


<line>
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

</line>


<line>
We did a special episode about elder care.

</line>


<line>
Now we're gonna watch it

and learn how to handle this bitch.

</line>


<line>
When you say "this bitch",

do you mean your mom's <name type="NORP">dem</name>entia

or your mom?

</line>


<line>
I think you can pick that up

through context.

</line>

Hush, <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>.

That's my son on the television.

</line>


<line>
-You know him?

<nonVerbComm>[Ethan]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You heard the boss man.</ital>

<ital>Whoa, whoa, Ethan,</ital>

<ital>this man is our guest!</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
-You know I hate g<name type="ORG">un</name>s, right?

-I know.

</line>


<line>
Although my official stated

political opinion

is I respect the Second Amendment

but I think some g<name type="ORG">un</name> purchases

should require the barest amo<name type="ORG">un</name>t 

of backgro<name type="ORG">un</name>d checks.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>,

you know I hate g<name type="ORG">un</name>s, too.

</line>


<line>
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

</line>


<line>
But being a g<name type="ORG">un</name> owner finally makes me

feel as safe walking down the street

as a man gets to feel all the time.

</line>


<line>
And that's an incredible feeling

I'm not ready to give up yet.

</line>


<line>
If you can frack <name type="ORG">un</name>der our house,

I should get to have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
All right, that's fair.

</line>


<line>
I'm really proud we've fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d a way

to keep our personal lives

and our political lives compartmentalized.

</line>


<line>
Me, too.

<ital>-You have no idea...</ital>

<ital>-Yes. I have no idea?</ital>

</line>

<ital>-Is your bubble of privilege so thick...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're addicted to these things.</ital>

</line>

<ital>And what is it with men</ital>

<ital>and not wanting women to feel safe?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh? Good.

</line>


<line>
Because you love that BoJack, right?

</line>


<line>
Well, he's not much of a son,

but the show can be a comfort sometimes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
They were playing your dumb show

in his hospital room.

</line>


<line>
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

</line>


<line>
In the episode I saw, you walked in

on your daughter in the shower.

</line>


<line>
The old one. That episode got us

into the <ital><name type="ORG">TV Guide</name></ital>

"Cheers and <name type="ORG">Jeers</name>" column.

</line>


<line>
We did not get a "Cheers."

</line>


<line>
You always could play the fool, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
We have to have this conversation now,

on the way to Dad's f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> There was so much more

I wanted to say to him.

</line>


<line>
Well... you can forget it now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Olivia]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And since you saw me naked,</ital>

</line>


<line>
Out of the way, hag,

you're blocking the screen.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
I know this must be painful for you.

</line>


<line>
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

</line>


<line>
If I'm not getting credit

for coming, what's the point?

</line>


<line>
If only there was some way for her

to connect the BoJack from the show

with the BoJack who visits her every week.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?

-Can we what?

</line>


<line>
Put on a live episode

of <ital><name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d </ital>in the nursing home.

</line>


<line>
-Good thinking, <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
We'll do a <ital><name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

here at the home.

</line>


<line>
She'll love it

because it's her son BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-Okay...

-Then after the show,

</line>


<line>
I'll come out and say hello.

And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

</line>


<line>
When her eyes spark with recognition,

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna sit down next to her,

I'm gonna squeeze her hand

and get real close and say...

</line>


<line>
-"Fuck you, Mom."

-What?

</line>


<line>
I can finally tell her off!

I'm gonna say, "Look at you,

you old piece of shit,

rotting in a nursing home!"

</line>


<line>
-Now I have the power!

-That's what you want to say to her?

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's gonna be great!

I can't wait to see the look on her face.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Bad news.

</line>


<line>
Hear about the mass shooting

outside Tulsa?

</line>


<line>
Terrible tragedy.

Thoughts and prayers.

</line>


<line>
We really have to do something

about these men who go...

</line>


<line>
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

</line>


<line>
A woman mass shooter?

Oh, no, that really <ital>is </ital>bad news!

</line>


<line>
I just think this is what happens

when you give women g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

</line>


<line>
They start shooting people with them.

</line>


<line>
I mean, do they even know

what g<name type="ORG">un</name>s are for?

</line>


<line>
I don't feel safe anymore

walking down my own street alone at night.

</line>


<line>
Me, a man!

</line>


<line>
I am convening a series

of <name type="ORG">congress</name>ional hearings

</line>


<line>
on the matter of women and g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

</line>


<line>
Because even one death

from the bullet of a female g<name type="ORG">un</name> owner

</line>


<line>
is too many.

</line>


<line>
What are my constituents supposed to do,

</line>


<line>
not compliment

random women on the street

</line>


<line>
because they might be

carrying a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
We cannot allow our lives

to be dictated by that kind of fear.

</line>


<line>
So you see, the trigger was specifically

designed for a man's grip

</line>


<line>
and a man's temperament.

</line>


<line>
Look, all I'm saying is

</line>


<line>
maybe you shouldn't blame women

for wanting g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you should blame

the constant societal messaging

</line>


<line>
that tells us we are safe only as long

as the men aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d us allow us to be.

</line>


<line>
So if you have a problem

with women carrying firearms,

</line>


<line>
you can roll up your sleeves

and actually work to create a society

</line>


<line>
where women feel safe and equal,

or you can just ban all g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

</line>


<line>
-[gavel banging]

-The <name type="ORG">ayes</name> have it.

</line>


<line>
Possession of any firearm is now illegal

in the state of <name type="GPE">California</name>.

</line>


<line>
We did it, boys.

</line>


<line>
-Huzzah!

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
-Congratulations!

-Fabulous!

</line>


<line>
I thought that was gonna go the other way.

</line>


<line>
Wow, Diane.

You just passed sensible g<name type="ORG">un</name> legislation.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe this co<name type="ORG">un</name>try hates women

more than it loves g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

</line>


<line>
No?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I don't know about this.

</line>


<line>
You'll be fine.

Just remember to en<name type="ORG">un</name>ciate.

</line>


<line>
It helps if you imagine

performing for the back row.

</line>


<line>
-Not that. I mean...

-Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!

</line>

<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

</line>


<line>
We just started. Let's at least

get through the first act

before we judge ourselves

too harshly, huh?

</line>


<line>
I wonder if there's a way

to make math f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

You think we should

still finish the episode, or...?

</line>


<line>
Our insurance policy

is very strict and very clear.

</line>


<line>
Once a resident becomes violent,

we can no longer house them.

</line>


<line>
Can you recommend another facility?

</line>


<line>
Frankly, at your mother's rate

of deterioration,

she probably doesn't have much time.

</line>


<line>
I recommend she spend it surro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded

by the people who care about her.

</line>


<line>
Okay, who are they?

Do you have their number?

</line>


<line>
-I was referring to you and your daughter.

-Oh. Uh...

</line>


<line>
We'll take her.

She can have the guest room,

</line>


<line>
-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Okay. If she really doesn't have

much time left.

</line>


<line>
But if we get to this time next year,

she's still hanging on,

you will be getting

a very strongly worded letter, mister.

That's all we got,

once we took out all the g<name type="ORG">un</name>s.

Maybe it could work

as an H&amp;M commercial?

</line>


<line>
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah.

<line>
Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry you didn't get

to tell your mom off.

</line>


<line>
I keep thinking

about all the things I never said

because I was so sure

there'd be other days to say them.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you tell her now?

-It's not the same.

</line>


<line>
I should have done it

back when she knew who I was,

back when it would mean something.

</line>


<line>
But now, she's gonna die

and she's never gonna know

just how much I hate her.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah? You're not just saying that?

-She read your book, didn't she?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, but I really wanted

to say it to her face.

</line>


<line>
Well, hey, she's here now, right?

And she has good days and bad days.

</line>


<line>
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.

And then you can totally rip into her.
