<line>
Oh, no. No, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

</line>


<line>
Sorry to interrupt your lunch,

but there was another mass shooting.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, where?

</line>


<line>
A town outside Tampa called--

</line>


<line>
Not geographically, dipshit.

What's the location?

</line>


<line>
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

</line>


<line>
-It was a shopping mall.

-No!

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Ms. Taken</ital> is coming out next month.

-I know, sir.

</line>


<line>
The whole third act

revolves around Courtney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>

shooting people in a mall.

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do now,

not release the movie?

</line>


<line>
I hope it doesn't come to that.

</line>


<line>
I am sick and tired

of real-life g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence

getting in the way of us telling stories

that glamorize g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence.

</line>


<line>
Why does this keep happening?

Has the whole world gone crazy?

</line>


<line>
No, we've just been conditioned

by a rugged individualist culture

woven into the savage architecture

of our country itself,

birthed as it was

through violent uprising,

but perhaps popularized

in the modern imagination by stories of--

</line>


<line>
Okay, <name type="PERSON">Chomsky</name>, when I want you to talk,

</line>


<line>
I'll staple a string to your back

and then yank it.

</line>


<line>
Why not make yourself useful

and schedule a sit-down

with Courtney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>'s team

to talk about how we distance ourselves

from this <ital>fakakte mishegoss.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Got it.

Except for the foccacia<ital> </ital>Michigan part.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Excuse me, could you point me</ital>

<ital>in the direction of an H&amp;M?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sure. But when you get there,</ital>

<ital>you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be DOA.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Uh-uh. You picked the wrong shopaholic</ital>

<ital>to mess with.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Because this shopaholic's</ital>

<ital>also a holic for revenge.</ital>

</line>

-Wow. Carla <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benzbrown.

-Yep.

</line>


<line>
-My mother.

-That's right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I lied!

-What?

</line>


<line>
There's no Carla <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benzbrown.

</line>


<line>
-I have no idea w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> your mother is.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to have a relationship

lying to each other.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so why did you lie to me?

</line>


<line>
I meant everything else I said.

</line>


<line>
I'll do everything I can

to help find your mom.

</line>


<line>
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.

</line>


<line>
In fact, in my experience,

they're soulless succubi

</line>


<line>
born fully formed from the ass of Satan.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my grandmother

sounds like quite a character.

</line>


<line>
-Can I meet her?

-Oh, my mom?

</line>


<line>
No, you cannot meet my mom

because she's... dead.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Dead mom.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, what happened

to the fudgesicles I bought?

</line>


<line>
-I lied again. My mom's not dead.

-Stop lying to me!

</line>


<line>
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.

Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.

</line>


<line>
I do. Where does she live?

</line>


<line>
Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,

</line>


<line>
she has her own private room

with a nice view,

</line>


<line>
'round-the-clock medical care,

</line>


<line>
and plenty of other seniors

to say casually cruel things to

</line>


<line>
under a passive-aggressive veil

of plausible deniability.

</line>


<line>
What's this place called?

</line>


<line>
I want to say Whispering Pines.

Whistling Pines?

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
Something with a W. Winter's Bone?

</line>


<line>
-Take me there.

-[groans] Fine!

</line>


<line>
-For real this time?

-Yes. I promise.

</line>


<line>
I am not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> lie to you ever again.

</line>


<line>
-Did you eat the last fudgesicle?

-No.

</line>


<line>
I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle.

</line>


<line>

<ital>I was just another damsel in distress,</ital>

</line>

</line>


<line>
Oh... oh.

</line>


<line>
-[groans] That is not good.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Everybody set a Google Alert

for "mass shooting."

</line>


<line>
Can't keep getting caught

off guard.

</line>


<line>
This is so sad.

</line>


<line>
You always hear about mass shootings

affecting other people's movie openings,

but you never think they're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

affect <ital>your </ital>movie opening. [sobs]

</line>


<line>
My thoughts and prayers

to the victims and their families.

</line>


<line>
-Of course. Yeah, thoughts and prayers.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>houghts and prayers.

</line>


<line>
Tragedy like this

really puts things in perspective.

</line>


<line>
Like, what are we doing

sitting in a conference room?

</line>


<line>
Life is short. We should have

this meeting at a water park.

</line>


<line>
Whoa! A water park

where people have meetings.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe that's the movie.

-I'm sorry, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this schmuck?

</line>


<line>
I'm Courtney's asexual fake fiancé.

</line>


<line>
He's a common person/supermodel,

being engaged to him makes me appear

more approachable/glamorous.

</line>


<line>
Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time

to cut the mall shootout from the film.

</line>


<line>
That still leaves

the movie theater shootout,

</line>


<line>
-the shootout at the county fair, the--

-[vibrations and buzzing]

</line>


<line>
We should probably lose

the movie theater shootout.

</line>


<line>
Right. Well, we still have

the county fair shootout.

</line>


<line>
-[vibrations and buzzing]

-Oh, dear.

</line>


<line>
-This is a sad day.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
-<ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?</ital>

-Hi.

</line>


<line>
-Where have you been?

<ital>-Listen.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

I was an awful boyfriend to you.

</line>


<line>
I was an awful client,

and I was an awful friend.

</line>


<line>
This last year I spent some time away

and it made me realize

how special the people in my life are.

</line>


<line>
<ital>And you might be</ital>

<ital>the most special of them all.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wow, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

I-- I appreciate that.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

do you remember the name

of that super nice elder care facility

that we both agreed was the best place

for my mom to r<name type="ORG">un</name> out the clock?

</line>


<line>
Oh, pluck a duck.

It's called <name type="GPE">Walnut Springs</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Walnut Springs</name>!

I knew there was a W in there. Bye!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[ringing]

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I feel like I didn't strike the right tone

in the last phone call.

</line>


<line>
I really am sorry,

and the most important thing is,

you know how dedicated I am

to making things right again.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

turns out there's a few Walnut Springses

in the <name type="GPE">SoCal</name> area.

</line>


<line>
It's the one in <name type="GPE">Santa Barbara</name>, dummy!

</line>


<line>
-Yeesh! <name type="PERSON">Cranky</name> much? W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> died?

-A lotta people!

</line>


<line>
-[panting]

-Sorry, what did I miss?

</line>


<line>
Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan

to curtail g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying,

if people have the right pumped-up kicks,

maybe they can outr<name type="ORG">un</name> the bullets.

</line>


<line>
All this talk of g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence

is depressing.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Ms. Taken </ital>is a movie about empowerment.

-That's what I've been saying!

</line>


<line>
It's <ital><name type="PERSON">Bridget</name> Jones</ital>

with slightly more bloody murdering.

</line>


<line>
We just have to keep the story

on Courtney,

and not on the depressingly

unstoppable rise

of real-life g<name type="ORG">un</name> violence in this country,

thoughts and prayers.

-Hello?

I got an exclusive for you.

</line>


<line>
You are going to write a glowing feature

about my client and her new movie.

</line>


<line>
-Why would I...

-You know Courtney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>.

</line>


<line>
You probably recall when she soared

as the thorny horticulturist

in <ital>One Sordid Fortnight</ital>

<ital>With the Short-Skirted Sorceress.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-How would you enjoy joining <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>

for a scorched soy porterhouse pork

four-courser at Koi?

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what?

-Glorify your source,

but don't make it feel forced, of course,

and try the borscht. Smooches!

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Hey--</ital>

-And that's how you do it, folks.

</line>


<line>
Oh... [gasps]

</line>


<line>
You're telling me

you didn't feel one twinge of guilt

when you left your mom in this place?

</line>


<line>
Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt,

trying to remember, no.

</line>


<line>
-Definitely not.

-Damn.

</line>


<line>
You didn't know my mom.

</line>


<line>
Football?

You don't have the haunches for it.

</line>


<line>
You'll only embarrass yourself,

as in every other endeavor you pursue.

</line>


<line>
-But, Mom...

-If you're looking to get knocked around

for an afternoon, why don't you just read

one of your father's manuscripts

and tell him his prose

is pedestrian and derivative?

Works for me every time.

Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>, you have a visitor.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hi, Mom.

-Do I know you?

</line>


<line>
Here we go.

Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>?

-Okay, we're doing this?

</line>


<line>
I think she really doesn't know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are.

</line>


<line>
She knows.

This is just like when she pretended

not to recognize me

after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

</line>


<line>
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> liked to tickle a lot more

than just the ivories.

</line>


<line>
When I made it home unscathed, she said,

"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, could I trouble you

for some orange juice, please?

</line>


<line>
Stop calling me <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>!

Nobody here's named <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>!

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, orange juice. Now!

You're not being paid

for polite conversation.

-Oh, hello! It's you.

<name type="PERSON">Holly</name>hock.

</line>


<line>
I must apologize for <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>.

She learned to read on secondhand books.

Mom, do you really not know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I am?

Me, famous <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
If you are getting orange juice,

I'd love a glass too.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
So you see

I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you put your pants on

one leg at a time.

</line>


<line>
Well, I step into my pants

one leg at a time,

then my trouser-maidens lift the legs

simultaneously to avoid <name type="ORG">wrinklage</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, right, of course,

why else have trouser-maidens?

</line>


<line>
-Hey.<ital> Konichiwa, </ital>Princess Mulan.

-Just leave us alone, okay?

</line>


<line>
I was giving you a compliment.

</line>


<line>
First, <ital>konichiwa </ital>is not a compliment,

it's Japanese for hello.

</line>


<line>
Second, I'm not Japanese.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I could put something

in that sweet mouth of yours

</line>


<line>
-so you don't have to talk so much.

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
One more step, asshole.

</line>


<line>
-What...

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
I was joking.

I don't want any trouble.

</line>


<line>
-Tell your story walking.

-...the...

shit was that?

</line>


<line>
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.

</line>


<line>
Why do you even have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Well, using it in the movie

was so empowering,

and now I just carry it everywhere.

Do you want to hold it?

</line>


<line>
No, I am very anti-g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns

is inherently--

</line>


<line>
Holy shit, I'm holding a g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

How long has this been in my hand?

</line>


<line>
-Slides right in, doesn't it?

-It actually feels kind of nice.

</line>


<line>
Would you like to try shooting it?

We can go to my g<name type="ORG">un</name> range.

</line>


<line>
You have your own g<name type="ORG">un</name> range?

-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>, me? Or <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

-You look just like him.

</line>


<line>
-People tell me that.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Your mother's dementia

is progressing rapidly.

</line>


<line>
-You came out of nowhere.

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol

for the alarming creep of dementia.

</line>


<line>
-It isn't there, until it is.

-Thank you, very colorful.

</line>


<line>
We tried to call you,

but the number you gave us

</line>


<line>
-connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.

-Is that right?

</line>


<line>
This is the most responsive

she's been in weeks.

</line>


<line>
I think with regular visits

from you and your daughter--

</line>


<line>
That's not happening.

</line>


<line>
Seeing my mom

is like a Terrence Malick movie.

</line>


<line>
Every ten years or so is bearable,

but more than that

and it starts to get annoying.

</line>


<line>
She won't last another ten years.

</line>


<line>
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!

-Huh?

We can't just leave her like this.

if you believe in yourself.

-[<name type="PERSON">Bea</name>] <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Every week.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
Because she's your mother

and dementia is hereditary.

</line>


<line>
One day, you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

in a home like this, and so will I,

and wouldn't you want

someone visiting you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Morning time, Hollywoo!

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">A <name type="PERSON">Ryan</name> Seacrest Type</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I'm <name type="PERSON">A Billy Bush Type</name>.

</line>


<line>
Here's something

I'm just now reading on a cue card.

</line>


<line>
All the ladies

are getting concealed carry permits.

</line>


<line>
It's the newest thing.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't want to be around

one of those ladies

at a certain time of the month,

if you know what I mean.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> I don't.

</line>


<line>
Joking aside, I think it's great

these gals have a hobby.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers

that we have a breaking news alert--

</line>


<line>
-there has been another mass shooting.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
I am totally unqualified

to cover a news story this important.

</line>


<line>
But as a straight white male,

I will plow forward with confidence

and assume I'm doing fine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Again with the crazy gunmen.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have to put this movie

on the shelf

next to that wacky vacation comedy we did

about the klutzy babysitter.

</line>


<line>
-[Todd] <ital>Ha! That sounds hilarious!</ital>

-What the hell are you doing on this call?

</line>


<line>
Imagining that funny movie

you just described.

</line>


<line>
Okay, what do all these shootings

have in common?

</line>


<line>
Guns? Bullets? W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are you,

Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

</line>


<line>
Men! What if we played up

the "Ms." in <ital>Ms. Taken</ital>?

</line>


<line>
In a world of increasing terror,

our movie tells women

they don't have to be afraid anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, now you're talking.

-When you put it that way,

it almost sounds like these mass shootings

could be a good thing for the movie.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, of course not.

They're a terrible tragedy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>houghts and prayers

are with the victims.

</line>


<line>
-Right, thoughts and prayers.

-But...

anything that makes women feel unsafe

might actually help our box office.

</line>


<line>
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

</line>


<line>
Of course not!

</line>


<line>
Nobody wants that,

nobody's saying that.

</line>


<line>
But if they already <ital>do</ital> feel unsafe,

there's no reason not to capitalize.

</line>


<line>
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.

</line>


<line>
Exactly, we're not making them

feel unsafe.

</line>


<line>
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,

from there being more mass shootings.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
In that case,

I got good news and I got bad news.

</line>


<line>
Bad news is

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> want to avoid the 405.

</line>


<line>
-Ta-da!

-Ugh! Keep it down.

</line>


<line>
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

</line>


<line>
It's not a book, it's a D<name type="PERSON">VD</name> case.

</line>


<line>
We did a special episode about elder care.

</line>


<line>
Now we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> watch it

and learn how to handle this bitch.

</line>


<line>
When you say "this bitch",

do you mean your mom's dementia

or your mom?

</line>


<line>
I think you can pick that up

through context.

</line>


<line>
Season two, episode 12.

</line>


<line>
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up,

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Dementia</name>."

</line>


<line>
-I'll go lie down.

</line>


<line>
Hush, <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>.

That's my son on the television.

</line>


<line>
-You know him?

-I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You heard the boss man.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Guess your daughter, the bikini model,</ital>

<ital>will have to pick you up at the park.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Daughter, the bikini model?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Whoa, whoa, <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>,</ital>

<ital>this man is our guest!</ital>

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-You know I hate guns, right?

-I know.

</line>


<line>
Although my official stated

political opinion

is I respect the Second Amendment

but I think some g<name type="ORG">un</name> purchases

should require the barest amount 

of background checks.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

you know I hate guns, too.

</line>


<line>
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

</line>


<line>
But being a g<name type="ORG">un</name> owner finally makes me

feel as safe walking down the street

as a man gets to feel all the time.

</line>


<line>
And that's an incredible feeling

I'm not ready to give up yet.

</line>


<line>
If you can frack under our house,

I should get to have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
All right, that's fair.

</line>


<line>
I'm really proud we've found a way

to keep our personal lives

and our political lives compartmentalized.

</line>


<line>
Me, too.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-You have no idea...</ital>

<ital>-Yes. I have no idea?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Is your bubble of privilege so thick...</ital>

<ital>-What's with humans and guns?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're addicted to these things.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And what is it with men</ital>

<ital>and not wanting women to feel safe?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I don't--</ital>

<ital>-This is a gendered issue...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Excuse me!</ital>

<ital>-...make no mistake.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I don't think women...</ital>

<ital>-You can't sympathize...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>...running around with guns</ital>

<ital>makes anybody safer.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Yeah. That's the danger.</ital>

<ital>-I don't--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Excuse me.</ital>

<ital>-Not the men</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> commit 90 percent of murders,</ital>

<ital>it's the crazy hysterical women</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you gotta worry about!</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> Yes, yes! Fill my chamber

with your powerful bullets!

Beatrice, look w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s back.

</line>


<line>
And we brought more<ital> <name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh? Good.

</line>


<line>
Because you love that <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
Well, he's not much of a son,

but the show can be a comfort sometimes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
They were playing your dumb show

in his hospital room.

</line>


<line>
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

</line>


<line>
In the episode I saw, you walked in

on your daughter in the shower.

</line>


<line>
The old one. That episode got us

into the <ital>TV Guide</ital>

"Cheers and <name type="ORG">Jeers</name>" column.

</line>


<line>
We did not get a "Cheers."

</line>


<line>
You always could play the fool, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
We have to have this conversation now,

on the way to <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s funeral?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> There was so much more

I wanted to say to him.

</line>


<line>
Well... you can forget it now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And since you saw me naked,</ital>

<ital>that means I get to see you naked!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[The Horse]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Something tells me</ital>

<ital>I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> regret this.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[audience laughing]

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Out of the way, hag,

you're blocking the screen.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
I know this must be painful for you.

</line>


<line>
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

</line>


<line>
If I'm not getting credit

for coming, what's the point?

</line>


<line>
If only there was some way for her

to connect the <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> from the show

with the <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> visits her every week.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?

-Can we what?

</line>


<line>
Put on a live episode

of <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around </ital>in the nursing home.

</line>


<line>
-Good thinking, <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>hock.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
We'll do a <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around</ital>

here at the home.

</line>


<line>
She'll love it

because it's her son <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Okay...

-Then after the show,

</line>


<line>
I'll come out and say hello.

And she'll say, "<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>? Is that you?"

</line>


<line>
When her eyes spark with recognition,

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> sit down next to her,

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> squeeze her hand

and get real close and say...

</line>


<line>
-"Fuck you, Mom."

-What?

</line>


<line>
I can finally tell her off!

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> say, "Look at you,

you old piece of shit,

rotting in a nursing home!"

</line>


<line>
-Now I have the power!

-That's what you want to say to her?

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be great!

I can't wait to see the look on her face.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Bad news.

</line>


<line>
Hear about the mass shooting

outside Tulsa?

</line>


<line>
Terrible tragedy.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>houghts and prayers.

</line>


<line>
We really have to do something

about these men w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> go...

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">P.C.</name> This time it was a woman.

</line>


<line>
A woman mass shooter?

Oh, no, that really <ital>is </ital>bad news!

</line>


<line>
I just think this is what happens

when you give women guns.

</line>


<line>
They start shooting people with them.

</line>


<line>
I mean, do they even know

what guns are for?

</line>


<line>
I don't feel safe anymore

walking down my own street alone at night.

</line>


<line>
Me, a man!

</line>


<line>
I am convening a series

of congressional hearings

</line>


<line>
on the matter of women and guns.

</line>


<line>
Because even one death

from the bullet of a female g<name type="ORG">un</name> owner

</line>


<line>
is too many.

</line>


<line>
What are my constituents supposed to do,

</line>


<line>
not compliment

random women on the street

</line>


<line>
because they might be

carrying a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
We cannot allow our lives

to be dictated by that kind of fear.

</line>


<line>
So you see, the trigger was specifically

designed for a man's grip

</line>


<line>
and a man's temperament.

</line>


<line>
Look, all I'm saying is

</line>


<line>
maybe you shouldn't blame women

for wanting guns.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you should blame

the constant societal messaging

</line>


<line>
that tells us we are safe only as long

as the men around us allow us to be.

</line>


<line>
So if you have a problem

with women carrying firearms,

</line>


<line>
you can roll up your sleeves

and actually work to create a society

</line>


<line>
where women feel safe and equal,

or you can just ban all guns.

</line>


<line>
-[gavel banging]

-The <name type="ORG">ayes</name> have it.

</line>


<line>
Possession of any firearm is now illegal

in the state of <name type="GPE">California</name>.

</line>


<line>
We did it, boys.

</line>


<line>
-Huzzah!

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
-Congratulations!

-Fabulous!

</line>


<line>
I thought that was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go the other way.

</line>


<line>
Wow, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

You just passed sensible g<name type="ORG">un</name> legislation.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe this country hates women

more than it loves guns.

</line>


<line>
No?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I don't know about this.

</line>


<line>
You'll be fine.

Just remember to enunciate.

</line>


<line>
It helps if you imagine

performing for the back row.

</line>


<line>
-Not that. I mean...

-Shh! Here they come. <name type="PERSON">Gladys</name>, hit it!

'cause I love waffling!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Olivia</name>, you usually love

my breakfast humor.

</line>


<line>
Why so glum, sugarplum?

<line>
It's this algebra homework

that gives me the blues.

</line>


<line>
-X-axis? Y-axis?

-[panting and gasping]

</line>


<line>
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis?

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Henrietta</name>, what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, maybe we should stop.

</line>


<line>
We just started. Let's at least

get through the first act

before we judge ourselves

too harshly, huh?

</line>


<line>
I wonder if there's a way

to make math f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>

-[clicking]

-The only thing I like is rap music songs.

-[groaning and panting]

</line>


<line>
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

</line>


<line>
Don't change it.

I want to see if this married couple

can work through their differences.

</line>


<line>
-Gimme the remote!

-This isn't right!

</line>


<line>
-Guys, sharing is caring!

-[grunts]

<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Code red, code red!

What is happening? I don't like this!

</line>


<line>
No!

-Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

I am the heiress

to the <name type="PERSON">Sugarman</name> Sugarcube Company.

You can't do this to me!

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screaming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I never get to watch what I want.

</line>


<line>
You think we should

still finish the episode, or...?

</line>


<line>
Our insurance policy

is very strict and very clear.

</line>


<line>
Once a resident becomes violent,

we can no longer house them.

</line>


<line>
Can you recommend another facility?

</line>


<line>
Frankly, at your mother's rate

of deterioration,

she probably doesn't have much time.

</line>


<line>
I recommend she spend it surrounded

by the people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> care about her.

</line>


<line>
Okay, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are they?

Do you have their number?

</line>


<line>
-I was referring to you and your daughter.

-Oh. Uh...

</line>


<line>
We'll take her.

She can have the guest room,

</line>


<line>
-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Okay. If she really doesn't have

much time left.

</line>


<line>
But if we get to this time next year,

she's still hanging on,

you will be getting

a very strongly worded letter, mister.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Excuse me, could you point me</ital>

<ital>in the direction of an H&amp;M?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Sure.</ital>

-[click]

</line>


<line>
That's all we got,

once we took out all the guns.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it could work

as an H&amp;M commercial?

</line>


<line>
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah.

Cut down in the prime of its life.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

</line>


<line>
Eh, I'll be fine.

<line>
-Oh.

-[growls]

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry you didn't get

to tell your mom off.

</line>


<line>
I keep thinking

about all the things I never said

because I was so sure

there'd be other days to say them.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you tell her now?

-It's not the same.

</line>


<line>
I should have done it

back when she knew w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I was,

back when it would mean something.

</line>


<line>
But now, she's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> die

and she's never <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> know

just how much I hate her.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure she knew, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah? You're not just saying that?

-She read your book, didn't she?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, but I really wanted

to say it to her face.

</line>


<line>
Well, hey, she's here now, right?

And she has good days and bad days.

</line>


<line>
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.

And then you can totally rip into her.
