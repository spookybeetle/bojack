<ital>Hank After Dark!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Wolf howls]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutters clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, no.

It's because we're on a show

called <ital><name type="ORG">Party of Five</name>. </ital>Get it?

</line>


<line>
Hey, buddy,

pass me that bottle of vodka?

</line>


<line>
-That's not really how this works.

-It's open bar, don't be a dick.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

-Do I know you?

</line>


<line>
This is my better half,

Katrina <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Katrina, BoJack.

-I don't watch TV.

</line>


<line>
Can I get another drink now or

will that quote, <name type="ORG">un</name>quote "embarrass" you?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--

-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
My friends told me to get

a prenup,

but I was like,

"Hey, marriage lasts forever."

</line>


<line>
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe two guys like us

were even in the same category

as Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> That's Uncle Hanky.

</line>


<line>
Listen, <name type="ORG">Peanutbottle</name>,

there is no "guys like us."

</line>


<line>
I'm BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
You're just some other guy

I'll probably never talk to again.

</line>


<line>
Hey, boys.

What is this, a crossover episode?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
That is the f<name type="ORG">un</name>niest thing

I have ever heard.

</line>


<line>
Uncle Hanky.

Sir, I am your biggest fan.

</line>


<line>
I used to watch <ital>Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>'s</ital>

<ital>Dance-Pop <name type="ORG">Cosmo</name>polis</ital>

every day after school.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?

-Of course, kid.

</line>


<line>
Here, let me advance this. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

And we probably got it.

</line>


<line>
And we'll find out

in four to six weeks.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I can't wait.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I gotta go.

My wife's hand just disappeared

into that busboy's pants.

</line>


<line>
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

</line>


<line>
Hey, kid, listen.

</line>


<line>
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

</line>


<line>
I've seen your show. You're really f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

</line>


<line>
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

</line>


<line>
That's just the way it is.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
This suit needs more flasks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-Diane</name>!

-[passenger] Aah!

</line>


<line>
Will you bring me one of those

big <name type="NORP">Toblerone</name> bars? [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't

be out there for another month.

</line>


<line>
Yes, I know, but I always forget to

write these things down.

</line>


<line>
Tell me, how's your little movie?

</line>


<line>
Actually one of the stars just died.

It's really sad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.</ital>

<ital>Meanwhile, Diane,</ital>

here in <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>, I'm stitching

children's arms back on.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

</line>


<line>
Are you giving me a thumb's up

or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

</line>


<line>
Well, now the production's

on hiatus

</line>


<line>
so BoJack and I

are going on a book tour

to promote the new paperback edition

of <ital>One Trick Pony.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Please get here soon, Diane.

</line>


<line>
The people of <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name> need you

and I need that <name type="NORP">Toblerone</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

</line>


<line>
You need to be on

your best behavior for this tour.

</line>


<line>
Don't do that BoJack thing

where you go off-script

</line>


<line>
and get a lot of people

mad at you.

</line>


<line>
What? I don't do that.

</line>


<line>
You're a movie star now.

</line>


<line>
Any bad press you get

can hurt <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now boarding, Flight 422 to <name type="GPE">J<name type="ORG">un</name>eau</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Please. We're going to <name type="GPE">Alaska</name>.

</line>


<line>
How am I gonna offend a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch

of inbred <name type="NORP">Eskimo</name> blubber-m<name type="ORG">un</name>chers?

</line>


<line>
You're right. What was I thinking?

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Republic of <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>'s</ital>

<ital>Prince Gustav</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>visiting <name type="GPE">Los Angeles</name> this week</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>while his co<name type="ORG">un</name>try</ital>

<ital>rests on the brink of civil war.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Prince Gustav</ital>

<ital>is a ruthless despot,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but I'd still rather share a bed</ital>

<ital>with him than my ex-wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Shannon, I didn't mean that.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dance music playing over speakers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Listen. With <ital>Hey, I Think You</ital>

<ital>Can Dance </ital>as a lead-in,

</line>


<line>
we are expecting big things

for <ital><name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name> Stars and Celebrities:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?</ital>

<ital>Let's Find Out,</ital>

or <ital>H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.</ital>

for short.

</line>


<line>
-Mm.

-[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

</line>


<line>
You guys can get

some pictures together.

</line>


<line>
Hank is coming here?

</line>


<line>
That old guy from

<ital>Hey, I Think You Can Dance?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What's the big deal?

-You don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
When I was a kid,

this guy was <ital>the</ital> guy.

</line>


<line>
I even bought his novelty rap album,

<ital>The Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name> Hip-Hop Hypothesis.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You shouldn't meet your hero

on an empty stomach.

</line>


<line>
-Want me to go get you some chili?

-Good call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="LOC">Chili</name> is nature's chillaxative.

</line>


<line>
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

</line>


<line>
-Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

-Oh, we've met.

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

you guys could stand back to back.

</line>


<line>
And then on the billboard it'll say:

</line>


<line>
"Hank and Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> are back

to back. Thursdays on <name type="ORG">MBN</name>." [laughs]

</line>


<line>
So, what should I do with my arms?

Like akimbo?

</line>


<line>
-You're fine.

-Reverse akimbo?

</line>


<line>
-No, that--

-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.

Got a momentum going.

</line>


<line>
-Can't stop windmilling now.

-Hey, hey.

</line>


<line>
Why don't we just do

what feels natural?

</line>


<line>
Guys like us? We're pros.

</line>


<line>
"Guys like us"?

</line>


<line>
You think I'm a guy like us?

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is the happiest moment

of my life.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

would you get a picture of us?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

</line>


<line>
Now we open the floor to questions

from the audience.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, your book talked a lot about

how much you love apple fritters.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

</line>


<line>
So, my question is:

</line>


<line>
Do you think <name type="GPE">Israel</name>

has a right to defend herself?

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-And what part should the U.S. play

as an ally?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, the thing about that...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both growl]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat

walked away from the table in 2000.

</line>


<line>
I mean, obviously there's no panacea,

but a two-state solution

</line>


<line>
with an emphasis on human rights

feels like a place to begin.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience murmuring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[Moose] Brilliant insight.

-[woman] Very good.

</line>


<line>
-My question is for Diane <name type="ORG">Nyu--</name> <name type="ORG">Nyu--</name>

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">Nyu--</name>

-You won't get it. Ask the question.

</line>


<line>
Your book went to some revealing places.

</line>


<line>
Were you worried at all that it

would hurt BoJack or his career?

</line>


<line>
That's a great question.

</line>


<line>
I'd also like to know

the answer to that, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Well, I think the truth

is worth pursuing, no matter what.

</line>


<line>
BoJack's not perfect.

There are other celebrities

who have done much worse things

and it hasn't hurt their careers.

</line>


<line>
-Like who?

-I don't know, like Mike Tyson

or... Sean <name type="ORG">Penn</name>, or Josh Brolin,

or <name type="NORP">Christian</name> Slater, Woody Allen,

</line>


<line>
Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>, Bill Murray...

</line>


<line>
Wait, wait, what about

Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>?

</line>


<line>
Well, all of his former assistants

have made the same allegations.

</line>


<line>
-I feel like we're getting off track.

-Do you not know that?

</line>


<line>
Any questions about me,

the handsome, famous horse with a book?

</line>


<line>
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

</line>


<line>
I'm not saying anything

not on the public record.

</line>


<line>
You can just <name type="ORG">Google</name>

"Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name> allegations" and I--

</line>


<line>
Oh, you don't have to

<name type="ORG">Google</name> it right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Dear God.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Stank</name>y Hanky?

Allegations vile and ranky.

</line>


<line>
But first, the visiting

<name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>n Prince Gustav

went missing briefly

this afternoon,

but he was quickly fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d

buying chili in <name type="GPE">Beverly</name> <name type="LOC">Hills</name>.

</line>


<line>
His official statement was,

"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hooray, being a prince."

</line>


<line>
Our main story,

ominous and anomalous accusations

against Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

</line>


<line>
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

and what does she have against

our beloved hippopotamus?

</line>


<line>
Joining me now is

<name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name> apologist

and armchair sociologist,

Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

</line>


<line>
what are these allegations?

</line>


<line>
These allegations are so crazy,

I can't even say them on TV

</line>


<line>
or I'll so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like a crazy person.

</line>


<line>
What I want to know

is why we're letting a national treasure

</line>


<line>
face the same kind of smear tactics

used by <name type="ORG">the Viet Cong</name>.

</line>


<line>
Are you calling attention to the fact

</line>


<line>
that Ms. Nguyen is <name type="GPE">Vietnam</name>ese?

</line>


<line>
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You gotta see</ital>

<ital>this set they're building!</ital>

</line>


<line>
There's a giant replica of my head,

and every episode, the eyes

light up with dollar signs,

confetti shoots out of the ears,

then I somersault out the mouth.

</line>


<line>
We're bringing class

back to primetime.

</line>


<line>
-So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds amazing.

-And I'm really getting along

with J.D. Salinger.

</line>


<line>
-Did you know we both hate phonies?

-I did know that.

</line>


<line>
So... listen.

Some website called "Tit P<name type="ORG">un</name>cher"

is saying you said some stuff

about Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>,

I didn't mean for that to happen.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do me a favor.

Please don't make a big thing out of this.

</line>


<line>
It's really not a good time, you know,

with my show about to la<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, we are on the same page.

-Oh, are you also on "Tit P<name type="ORG">un</name>cher"?

</line>


<line>
Because you should not read

the comments.

</line>


<line>
Believe me,

nothing would make me happier

than for this to just go away.

</line>


<line>
-Great. I love you, too.

-[with heavy accent] Hello.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God!

-Is chili you ask for.

</line>


<line>
I am peasant boy Todd

from village.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Friend of Peanut Man</name>, and lover

of federated <name type="GPE">America</name>n states.

</line>


<line>
No reason for suspicions.

[laughs] Come on!

</line>


<line>
Wait a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond, something's different.

[sniffs]

</line>


<line>
I am... digging this new cologne!

</line>


<line>
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

</line>


<line>
Is so great to be

in meager trash city <name type="GPE">Los Angeles</name>

with no pressures of royal life.

</line>


<line>
What? Royal life?

Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Look at me. Normals.

</line>


<line>
There's that classic

self-deprecating Todd wit.

</line>


<line>
I'd know it anywhere.

</line>


<line>
-We will now begin our Q and A.

-Fire when ready.

</line>


<line>
What you got against Uncle Hanky,

you uppity cooze?

</line>


<line>
Diane,

I believe this question is for you.

</line>


<line>
If anyone here has any questions

about the book,

</line>


<line>
I'd be happy to answer those.

</line>


<line>
As would I, BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

</line>


<line>
Golden-<name type="ORG">Globe</name> winning

star of the book.

</line>


<line>
If Hank did anything wrong,

they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm really not here

to talk about that.

</line>


<line>
You women are all the same.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me?

-Yeah, you make these

broad accusations

to get attention for yourself,

and when you don't have proof

to back it up, you just slink away.

</line>


<line>
I'm not slinking away.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to say one thing

about me.

</line>


<line>
I text and drive like all the time.

What?

</line>


<line>
Isn't that what happened with all

those assistants? They took his money,

and they don't even care

they could be ruining a man's life.

</line>


<line>
What? <ital>They ruined his</ital> life?

</line>


<line>
-You should probably just drop this.

-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

</line>


<line>
They don't even know

how much I'm gonna drop it.

</line>


<line>
The way you said that

made it so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like you won't drop it.

</line>


<line>
How dare you spread

a narrative that--

</line>


<line>
Don't tell me what to spread.

</line>


<line>
I'll spread whatever I want.

It's called one of the amendments.

</line>


<line>
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

</line>


<line>
-This is completely--

-Yeah, hi.

</line>


<line>
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I came with her. I gotta say

I'm opposed to child labor,

</line>


<line>
like as a rule, but there

are some kinds of labor

</line>


<line>
that children are just better at.

</line>


<line>
You ever try to fit

into a mine shaft?

</line>


<line>
That is a tight squeeze. What?

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, probably gonna get

some letters about that, huh?

</line>


<line>
I'm so incorrigible.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's paying attention

to me now!

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

</line>


<line>
Anyone else want a snack?

</line>


<line>
No? That's a no?

On the snacks? Okay.

</line>


<line>
What do you have against

Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>?

</line>


<line>
Everyone says

he's a really nice guy.

</line>


<line>
Good point.

</line>


<line>
That's exactly the problem.

Because he's so nice,

</line>


<line>
people don't wanna think

he's capable of awful things

</line>


<line>
so they let him off the hook.

</line>


<line>
We don't know what happened.

It's a classic "he said, she said."

</line>


<line>
"He said, <ital>they</ital> said."

It's eight different women.

</line>


<line>
-Are they all lying?

-I mean, probably. We do that.

</line>


<line>
At this point,

we just don't know enough to judge.

</line>


<line>
Who are these women?

Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

</line>


<line>
Do they wear short shorts?

</line>


<line>
Do they drink alcohol?

All these things are possible.

</line>


<line>
We don't know the facts.

</line>


<line>
See, this is part of the problem.

</line>


<line>
You're supposed to be a journalist.

</line>


<line>
You won't even tell your audience

what he's accused of.

</line>


<line>
You're an expert.

Why don't you tell us?

</line>


<line>
I'm not afraid to say it.

</line>


<line>
Eight different women,

all former assistants,

</line>


<line>
claim that Uncle Hanky

took them to a--

</line>


<line>
What is Diane doing?

</line>


<line>
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour

and she's upstaging me.

</line>


<line>
Like how it was supposed

to be my book.

</line>


<line>
Actually, this might be

a thing she does.

</line>


<line>
She knows that <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>

is the only thing

keeping my network afloat, right?

</line>


<line>
The same network

that employs her husband.

</line>


<line>
Why would she do this?

</line>


<line>
Sometimes she just whips

herself into a frenzy

and she loses all perspective.

Goddamn it, honeydew?!

</line>


<line>
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think

every time it gets invited to a party,

it can bring along

its dumb friend honeydew?

</line>


<line>
You don't get a plus-one,

cantaloupe!

</line>


<line>
You need to talk to her.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit

on <ital><name type="ORG">Contemporary Family</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>

<line>
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail

</line>


<line>
-Hey, man.

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
You know it's a federal crime to go

through someone else's mail?

</line>


<line>
I do not know your customs,

for I am dirt-poor servant child.

</line>


<line>
Oh, don't worry about it.

Now walk me through that mail.

</line>


<line>
Death threat for wife, death threat

for wife, once more death threat,

and here many monies off

for Bed Bath Beyond.

</line>


<line>
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

<line>
Diane? I want you

to meet Amanda Hannity,

editor-in-chief

here at <ital><name type="ORG">Manatee Fair</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
The pleasure's yours.

Walk with me, squawk with me.

</line>


<line>
That woman can knock a drink back like

a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

but damn if she doesn't

get shit done.

</line>


<line>
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

</line>


<line>
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you

an exposé on Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

</line>


<line>
I would love

to take down <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>

and finally topple the acropolis

of monstrous hypocrisy

that ensconces us.

</line>


<line>
Hey, wouldn't your readers

prefer something more relevant?

</line>


<line>
Like, uh, what to do with all those

extra buttons that come with your shirts.

</line>


<line>
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing

your weight behind this.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I didn't mean--

-That dress is hideous.

</line>


<line>
Go home, burn it and come back.

</line>


<line>
When we know what we know

about a monster like that

and we still put him on TV

every week,

we're teaching a generation

of yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g boys and girls

that a man's reputation

is more important

than the lives of the women

he's ruined.

</line>


<line>
Yes, exactly!

I feel like I've been alone

in a crazy alternate <name type="ORG">un</name>iverse

these last few days.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know I got your back,

right?

</line>


<line>
We women have got to stick to--

Hey, fruit plate.

</line>


<line>
No, people don't want articles

about that. People want life-hacks.

</line>


<line>
Diane, you need to be strong.

</line>


<line>
Everyone is g<name type="ORG">un</name>ning for you. You're

a woman talking out of turn about a man.

</line>


<line>
We're not supposed to have opinions.

We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

</line>


<line>
No, this model doesn't look as pretty

as the other one. Can we kill it?

</line>


<line>
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

</line>


<line>
We need to sit you down with someone

who's willing to go on the record.

</line>


<line>
I already reached out to all eight

of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

</line>


<line>
-What about his current assistant?

-You think she'd talk?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. What do you think,

<ital>But back to our main story,</ital>

<ital>what is Diane's problem?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'll say it once, for your article.

</line>


<line>
I didn't do any of those things

that you're accusing me of.

</line>


<line>
I wanna be very clear.

</line>


<line>
I'm not meeting you here

because I'm scared of you.

</line>


<line>
This is me doing you a favor.

</line>


<line>
-I think you are scared of me.

-I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

and I truly do believe that.

</line>


<line>
Twenty-four hours from now,

the news cycle

will move on to something else.

</line>


<line>
I'll go back to hosting my dance show,

which employs h<name type="ORG">un</name>dreds

of nice, good, hardworking people.

</line>


<line>
You, on the other hand,

are pretty much done.

</line>


<line>
People love me and they're

not gonna forgive you for this.

</line>


<line>
-This isn't about me.

-If you keep pushing this,

you're gonna drag down

the people close to you.

</line>


<line>
Look, you had your f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
So, why don't you call it a day

and go home to your husband?

</line>


<line>
I know who you are.

</line>


<line>
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.

</line>


<line>
I'm Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

</line>


<line>
Who the hell are you?

</line>


<line>
-So, you got nothing.

-I'm not giving up.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be someone

who will talk.

</line>


<line>
Oh, listen. I had a conversation

with my bosses

at AOL-<name type="ORG">Time</name> Warner-Pepsico-

Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Toyota</name>-<name type="ORG">Trader Joe's</name>,

and we agreed

these kind of stories,

they don't sell magazines.

</line>


<line>
-Are you seriously killing this?

-It's just not a good time.

</line>


<line>
So, this has nothing to do

with the fact

that AOL-<name type="ORG">Time</name> Warner-Pepsico-

</line>


<line>
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-<name type="ORG">Toyota</name>-

<name type="ORG">Trader Joe's</name> also owns <name type="ORG">MBN</name>,

and is currently profiting off of

Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>'s good reputation?

</line>


<line>
I know you're upset.

</line>


<line>
Would you like a Joe-Joe?

</line>


<line>
It's just like an <name type="NORP">Oreo</name>,

but <name type="ORG">Trader Joe's</name> style.

</line>


<line>
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

</line>


<line>
Because you're mad at me, right?

</line>


<line>
Not because Joe-Joes

taste like garbage?

</line>


<line>
So, help me to <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand...

</line>


<line>
Dog friend's program

is to find what celebrities know?

</line>


<line>
-Yep.

-So, is torture?

</line>


<line>
We don't torture people

</line>


<line>
That's called

one of the amendments.

</line>


<line>
No, of course.

</line>


<line>

No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

<nonVerbComm>[man 1]</nonVerbComm> Hey, Diane!

</line>

Why don't you shut

</line>


<line>
Don't you talk to her like that!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 2]</nonVerbComm>

Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.

</line>


<line>
I say you should

shut your stupid pretty face.

</line>


<line>
-This is not over. When people hear what--

-Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

</line>


<line>
-How could you say that?

-What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
I mean, what is your endgame

in all of this?

</line>


<line>
You don't actually believe

Hank's innocent, do you?

</line>


<line>
Of course not,

but that doesn't matter.

</line>


<line>
You're not gonna beat this guy.

</line>


<line>
I--

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Todd?

</line>


<line>
BoJack!

Thank God you fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d me.

</line>


<line>
I thought I would never see

you again.

</line>


<line>
-We're in the middle of something.

-I got mixed up in some bad stuff

and a genocide may or may not

have been perpetrated in my name.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you heard about it

on the news?

</line>


<line>
No, most of the news has been about

Diane and Hank <name type="GPE">Hippopopalous</name>.

</line>


<line>
What? Why? This is really serious.

</line>


<line>
Oh, of course your thing is serious

and my thing is just a dumb feminist

trying to get attention

by attacking a famous man, is that it?

</line>


<line>
Uh, what? No.

</line>


<line>
-Eat shit, Diane!

-You eat shit!

</line>


<line>
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know

what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
He spent the last few days

at Burning Man or whatever getting high.

</line>


<line>
No! That's not what happened at all.

</line>


<line>
A stranger just told me to eat shit.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand why you

can't be on my side about this.

</line>


<line>
I am on your side.

</line>


<line>
And I'm telling you

you're not gonna win this thing.

</line>


<line>
Also, P.S., when have you ever

been on my side?

</line>


<line>
-I am always on your side.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Like when you wrote that book?

Was that you being on my side?

</line>


<line>
You're not still mad about the book.

</line>


<line>
You manipulated me

and completely took advantage of--

</line>


<line>
Guys? There is a very fragile alliance

between the Cords and the <name type="NORP">Ovians</name>.

</line>


<line>
If we don't do something--

</line>


<line>
-Todd, nobody cares.

-Nobody cares, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Everything I did

was to help you tell the story

</line>


<line>
I knew you wanted to tell.

</line>


<line>
You got everything you wanted

because of that book.

</line>


<line>
You were a joke,

now people take you seriously.

</line>


<line>
You were out of work,

now you got your dream role.

</line>


<line>
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

</line>


<line>
But also, you were my friend

and you hurt my feelings.

</line>


<line>
And it's weird that

you never apologized for that...

and that you still won't.

</line>


<line>
Well... [quietly]

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

</line>


<line>
-Are you?

-Yes, actually. I am.

</line>


<line>
I didn't want to do that

and I probably could have

handled things better.

</line>


<line>
I definitely should have.

I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
But this is bigger than you and me.

</line>


<line>
And I need you in my corner now

because I don't have anybody else.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, okay.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'm in your corner.

</line>


<line>
Guys, earlier, some general

asked me if it was "a go"

</line>


<line>
...on "that thing we talked about"?

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Yes." And he said,

"God help us all" and left the room.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm not sure

that was the right answer.

</line>


<line>
So, then I called Wayne to see

if I could write a story for <ital><name type="ORG">Buzzfeed</name>.</ital>

Here's the good news:

</line>


<line>
They'll publish anything.

</line>


<line>
Hey, um...

</line>


<line>
Can I talk to you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, of course. What's up?

</line>


<line>
I asked you, really nicely,

not to make a big thing out of this.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, I know, but someone--

-Had to say something, right?

</line>


<line>
And that someone had to be you?

</line>


<line>
Because... why?

</line>


<line>
I really don't get it.

</line>


<line>
What is accomplished by you

being the one to take a stand on this?

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>--

stupid to you, and small.

</line>


<line>
But I need this to go well,

and I can't... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Those are death threats.

</line>


<line>
People want to murder my wife

because of what she's

saying on the news

about something that

she has nothing to do with.

</line>


<line>
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
God, you know, you'd almost

be safer in <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, maybe I should go to <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm obviously not making

a difference here.

</line>


<line>
Actually, maybe you should.

</line>


<line>
Go feel good about yourself

and do your important work.

</line>


<line>
And maybe some space

might be good for us.

</line>


<line>
You don't really want me to go,

do you?

what I want?
