<ital>♪♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
It happened a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in. Why do I keep

thinking things will make me happy?

</line>


<line>
-What is wrong with me?

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, don't do this.

</line>


<line>
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.

-Uh... Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm drowning.

</line>


<line>
-I feel like I'm drowning.

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, listen.

</line>


<line>
When I was 17,

I snuck out to a fraternity party.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he roads were icy</ital>

<ital>and I swerved into the lake.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I came to <name type="ORG">un</name>derwater.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It was dark and cold,</ital>

<ital>and I didn't even know which way was up.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught for sure I was going to drown.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And then... I noticed...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>when I opened my mouth,</ital>

<ital>the air <name type="PERSON">bub</name>bles floated up,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I knew</ital>

<ital>which way to swim.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is a terrifying story.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, when you find yourself lost

and disoriented and <name type="ORG">un</name>derwater

and you don't know which way is up,

it's important to breathe.

</line>


<line>
I don't deserve this.

I'm not a best actor.

</line>


<line>
Awards aren't about w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s best, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's literally the only thing

they're about.

</line>


<line>
No. All this means is that

you're one of the special people.

</line>


<line>
I saw it the first time I met you.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u must have known it all your life.

</line>


<line>
And all your life, people told you

that you were wrong,

that you weren't special,

that you were just like everybody else.

</line>


<line>
But now, the special people are saying,

<name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name> were right, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were right."

</line>


<line>
I was right.

I am one of the special people.

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-What are we doing just sitting here?

</line>


<line>
I just got nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Grab a handful of beans and go to town.

-Hey, this is all really something.

</line>


<line>
But I actually just came

because I heard about the nomination

and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny way

of saying congratulations.

can sometimes send you spinning.

<name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, why doesn't this make me happy?

Will anything make me happy?

</line>


<line>
I'm an empty husk." <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat kind of thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, thank you for that,

but I'm actually doing great.

</line>


<line>
I direct your attention to

the aforementioned chili cheese fo<name type="ORG">un</name>tain!

</line>


<line>
It's too bad I'm not managing

your social campaign anymore,

</line>


<line>
because this party would make

a great <name type="PERSON">Snapchat</name> story.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> make me guilty

about leaving Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.

Like I said--

</line>


<line>
Honestly, I don't even know

what you're doing over there.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>weeting for celebrities?

-Well, actually, I don't--

</line>


<line>
When I met you, you were

so cool and interesting--

</line>


<line>
Uh, I was never cool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u used to actually care about shit.

What happened?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe caring about shit got old.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me

and sending death threats to my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

</line>


<line>
and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,

and getting in fights with my husband,

</line>


<line>
and seeing little refugee boys

die in <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital bombings.

</line>


<line>
It's exhausting and I can't do it.

If that makes me a bad person,

</line>


<line>
then I'm sorry that I'm not

the "cool, interesting girl."

</line>


<line>
I never said you were a bad person.

I just said it's not you.

</line>


<line>
And you know it's not you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and this party is you?

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are all these people?

</line>

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're just looking at the <name type="PERSON">T</name>esla.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why it's so hard for you

to believe that I could be happy.

</line>


<line>
I'm not like you, okay?

</line>


<line>
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

</line>


<line>
-Sure.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't know anything about me.

or you can think you're better

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're our <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond "first c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice."

What do you say?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, a job like that? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want

a fully present presenter to present.

</line>


<line>
And I don't know

if I've got the pep in my step

to take that s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

where it needs to go, you know?

</line>


<line>
I've got a real pepless step, <name type="PERSON">Shep</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, let me know,

because if you don't want to do it,

we'll probably just post the list

of nominees online or something.

</line>


<line>
It's really not that big of a deal.

</line>


<line>
Hey, sorry about that.

Just got a call from the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>s.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey want me to <name type="PERSON">ho</name>st--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey want you to <name type="PERSON">ho</name>st the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>s?

</line>


<line>
Nomination anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cement.

</line>


<line>
But I don't think

I have it in me right now.

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta take that gig.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter...

what did <name type="PERSON">Nana <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter</name> always say?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> "Always take every opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity

that comes your way

because opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ities

are like sneezes from <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

and when <name type="PERSON">God</name> sneezes,

you can't say '<name type="PERSON">God</name> bless you' to <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

so instead you have

to take the opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity.

</line>


<line>
I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>y, that old <name type="PERSON">ga</name>l had something

for everything, didn't she?

</line>


<line>
I know you're worried about me,

but sitting aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use worrying

isn't going to help anyone.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but you'll call me

when you get out of the surgery, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> let my p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne leave my sight.

</line>


<line>
Of course. And now,

I've got something new to live for.

My little brother, telling the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le world

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> got an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>!

<line>
We are minutes away.

<name type="PERSON">Shep</name>, release the envelope.

</line>


<line>
Copy that. Releasing the envelope.

</line>


<line>
It's go time.

</line>


<line>
It's go time.

</line>


<line>
-Are you ready, Brother <name type="PERSON">Pricewater</name>?

-Of course, Brother <name type="ORG">House</name>coopers.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

we'd like to invite you to the stage.

It's here! <name type="PERSON">T</name>he golden envelope.

-Sure thing, yeah.

</line>


<line>
-No, put it in my <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et pocket.

I just, um... I wanted to give you

</line>

Okay. Now, where's the... the...

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. Could've sworn it was right here.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
Oh! <name type="PERSON">T</name>here you are.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get on stage.

</line>


<line>
Yes, just as soon as you give me that

backup envelope, please and <ital>por favor.</ital>

</line>


<line>
What back-up envelope?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>here is no back-up envelope.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a test and you passed.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">W<name type="ORG">un</name>derbar</name>.</ital>

Now, let's get you out there.

</line>


<line>
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage,

to anno<name type="ORG">un</name>ce the nominations.

</line>


<line>
Just as soon as I--

Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is that <name type="PERSON">Brad</name>ley <name type="PERSON">Cooper</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Brad</name>ley <name type="PERSON">Cooper</name>?

We love him for some reason.

</line>


<line>
-Where?

-Let's go, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, what do we do?

-It's okay.

</line>


<line>
We just need to come up

with all the nominees ourselves.

</line>


<line>
But I haven't even seen all the movies.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, nobody has.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w they give out awards.

</line>


<line>
-But--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ime for talk is over.

</line>


<line>
Now's the time for action.

</line>


<line>
And by "action," I mean

talking about these 24 categories

<name type="ORG">un</name>til we've settled on a list of nominees.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to tell me right now,

are you in or out?

</line>


<line>
Well, when you put it that way,

</line>


<line>
I guess you can call me

high-waisted denim,

because, right now, I am very in.

</line>


<line>
Let's do this.

</line>


<line>
What did you think of <name type="PERSON">Frieda</name> Pinto?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding me?

Anybody could do what she did.

</line>


<line>
"Don't take my baby.

I'll give you all my Bitcoins!"

</line>


<line>
Wow. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is good.

</line>


<line>
Okay, for Best Picture,

what about <ital>Avatar?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a good movie.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue, but did that come out this year?

</line>


<line>
-I feel like I just saw it.

-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

</line>


<line>
Let's just throw it on the list.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, do we have <name type="PERSON">Daniel</name> <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>

down for anything? He's always there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d catch! I'll add him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Daniel</name> <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay. We need one more nominee

for Best Actor. Oh, what about <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
His performance in <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat</ital>

was as t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughtful and self-aware

as we've ever seen him.

</line>


<line>
-Besides, he's our friend.

-Is he?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a! I am surprised to hear

you say that, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Let's dig into that. We have time.

-I don't think we do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're supposed to be

anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cing these, like, now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here is always time

to talk about our feelings.

</line>


<line>
As my <name type="PERSON">Nana <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter</name> used to say,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's always time

to talk about feelings,

because feelings

are the ceilings of our hearts,

and a leaky feeling ceiling

leads to a flood of blood.

</line>


<line>
And I'm cold.

Will you pass me that blanket?"

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess I'm just tired

of <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> walking all over everybody

and still getting everything he wants.

</line>


<line>
Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>, <name type="PERSON">mm</name>-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. I think

the important thing to remember here

is that <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is a damaged individual,

struggling a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst a sea of <name type="NORP">dem</name>ons,

many self-created, but still all too real.

</line>


<line>
Getting this nomination

from the two friends he loves the most--

you and also me--

would really mean a lot to him.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Okay.

</line>


<line>
But did you really think

he was that good in the movie?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

</line>


<line>
And the final nominee

for Best Picture is <ital>Avatar.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se are all the nominations.

I will not be taking any questions.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye. I must go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[audience clamoring]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I gotta say, we picked

some top-notch noms.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know it!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>y, was I glad when we got

out of that theater, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh.

</line>


<line>
I know. So many questions.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, what the hell happened?

</line>


<line>
Why were you reading off that napkin?

Why are you guys r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey have their nominees.

What more could they want?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what's crazy?

We saved the day today,

and no one will ever even know.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, we'll know.

-[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, we know what you did.

</line>


<line>
Oh, boy.

</line>


<line>
So, the good news is,

my brother's surgery was a success.

</line>


<line>
And the bad news is,

you're not nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
And the other good news is...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[voice fading out]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

...that each breath is a gift

and it is a joy to live.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-We are so lucky we get to be alive.

</line>


<line>
-No, before that.

-Oh, I didn't tell you.

</line>


<line>
-My brother's been sick.

-No, I don't care about your brother.

</line>


<line>
First of all, manners.

</line>


<line>
Second of all, I think if you met him,

you'd actually really hit it off.

</line>


<line>
Imagine me but with less

"in your face" cool guy attitude.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you say I'm not nominated

for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

but I feel like what everyone's

overlooking here is,

</line>


<line>
I got most of the categories dead-on.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's pretty amazing, and I am not

getting enough credit for that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you know

that <ital>Avatar </ital>came out in 2009?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

-No.

</line>


<line>
But you know what they say.

<name type="PERSON">"It</name>'s an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor just to be nominated."

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait.

</line>


<line>
So, I'm just like everybody else.

</line>


<line>
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,

please don't get mad at <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
-Why would I get mad at <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

-Exactly. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is totally my fault.

</line>


<line>
-He didn't even want to nominate you.

-What?

</line>


<line>
With the gift of hindsight,

</line>


<line>
I see now <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w that might have

made you even more upset.

</line>


<line>
But I realized something today,

when my brother called from the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital,

and I think it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

make you feel a lot better.

</line>


<line>
-What? What is it?

-None of this matters.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

<line>
As a partner in the company,

</line>


<line>
I am prepared to forgo my salary

for the next three months,

but even then, we're going

to need some sort of miracle.

</line>


<line>
What are we doing?

What was the point of any of this?

</line>


<line>
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

</line>


<line>
Soon, I'll get some offer

from one of the big five agencies

that I can't say no to,

and I'll go back to being another cog

in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker

that is this industry.

</line>


<line>
-Is that the best I can <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe for?

-Not necessarily.

</line>


<line>
Alt<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, there is one thing

I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld probably mention.

to congratulate him.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying to pick fights.

</line>


<line>
Well, you don't have to see him at all

if you don't want to.

</line>


<line>
It's not like you work for him anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> cares what he thinks?

</line>


<line>
Why do you have

this weird fixation with him?

</line>


<line>
I do not have a fixation, <name type="PERSON">Roxy</name>.

I worry about him.

</line>


<line>
Okay. And last year?

</line>


<line>
When you came back from <name type="PERSON">Cordovia</name>

and needed a place to crash?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you could have stayed with me,

or any of your other friends,

but you went right to his <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you ever ask yourself why?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're filling everyone's glasses.

<ital>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</ital>

<ital>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was walking back to my car,</ital>

<ital>when all of a sudden,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-this woman...</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn] <ital>Oh.</ital>

<ital>twisted her ankle,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-and tumbled into my arms.</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn] <ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>urns out, she was a ballerina,</ital>

<ital>and she didn't speak a word of English.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, I rushed her to the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital,</ital>

<ital>and long story s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt, we eloped.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn] <ital>Oh.</ital>

-I moved to <name type="GPE">Russia</name>,

and I'm totally messing with you.

</line>


<line>
-None of that's true.

-<ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I would love to see you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

I think about you all the time.

</line>


<line>
-Really? [chuckles]

<ital>-Yeah. How about this Saturday?</ital>

</line>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, to maintain the integrity

of the giant c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, hi.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were in <name type="ORG">Ojai</name>?

</line>


<line>
-No, I was just saying hi.

-Well, why not go to <name type="ORG">Ojai</name>, huh?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u and me?

I could use an escape, couldn't you?

</line>


<line>
It's not really a good time.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, I need this.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're my best friend and I need you.

</line>


<line>
Don't leave me now.

Don't be like everybody else.

</line>


<line>
I'm not leaving you. I just--

</line>


<line>
Besides, I think you owe me, right?

After what you did?

</line>


<line>
-What I did?

-Come on, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. I know.

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter told me everything.

-Everything?

</line>


<line>
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used

to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

</line>


<line>
-when I got out of the bath?

-What?

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd-o, me and <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd-o ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ Bath time come</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ke <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd shiny and clean ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
Mm, no, not-not about that.

</line>


<line>
So, he didn't tell you everything.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d he tell you about the time

I co<name type="ORG">un</name>ted to a million?

</line>


<line>
One, two, three, four, five, six--

</line>


<line>
-No, stop.

-But I was just getting to the good part!

</line>


<line>
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want

to nominate me for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, that.

-What the hell, man?

</line>


<line>
-After everything I've done for you?

-What are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here

for free for six years?

</line>


<line>
Giving you food, indulging you

in your little projects and adventures

and stories about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you used to bang

on your butt like a bongo drum?

</line>


<line>
I let you turn my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

into your company's headquarters

for the last month.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but that's not

because you're my friend.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's because you felt bad about <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know about <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>?

</line>


<line>
I think I know.

Why? What do you think I know?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I know what I think,

but I don't know if the thing that I think

is the thing that you think I know.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know?

-So, you know I had sex with <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>?!

</line>


<line>
-Well, what did you think?

-I don't know! Not that!

</line>


<line>
I just knew something sketchy happened.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught maybe you <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve her

one of your weird monologues

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w sad you are,

and it bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ed her out!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, I'm sorry, all right?

I screwed up.

</line>


<line>
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--

-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't keep doing this!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't keep doing shitty things,

and then feel bad about yourself

like that makes it okay!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to be better!

</line>


<line>
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

</line>


<line>
I was dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k, and there was all this

pressure with the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> campaign.

</line>


<line>
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--

-No! No, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, just stop.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are all the things

that are wrong with you.

</line>


<line>
It's not the alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l, or the drugs,

or any of the shitty things

that happened to you in your career,

or when you were a kid.

</line>


<line>
It's you.

</line>


<line>
All right? It's you.

</line>


<line>
Fuck, man.

What else is there to say?
