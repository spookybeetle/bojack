<line>
...fucker!

</line>


<line>
-So, we have some options.

-Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know I love you.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not what this is about.

</line>


<line>
We always agreed

we didn't want kids, <name type="ORG">un</name>less--

</line>


<line>
A streetwise but soulful teen

needed somewhere to live

as he waited

for his <name type="ORG">Juilliard</name> audition.

</line>


<line>
We'd support his dancing and let him

stay in the guest room, right.

</line>


<line>
-But a baby? Are you--?

-It's not about me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no "I" in uterus,

there's only "us."

</line>


<line>
And "U," and another "U,"

but that's the "U" that's in "us,"

so I already said that "U."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he point is,

I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>wo h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred and forty-seven percent,

that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w "there for you" I'll be.

</line>


<line>
-Whatever you decide...

-What we decide, because this is--

</line>


<line>
Definitely. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a conversation.

</line>


<line>
Let's both say what we want

at the same time on three.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-One, two--

</line>


<line>
On three or after three?

</line>


<line>
How could I say it "on three"?

I'll be saying "three."

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Okay.

-One, two, three...

</line>


<line>
-Abortion.

-Get an abortion.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. We said different things.

My clients have won <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>s

Nine out of ten?

<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name><name type="ORG">un</name>g people and their p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>nes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here could be a beautiful rainbow

in this room right now

</line>


<line>
and you would have no idea.

</line>


<line>
Really makes you think, huh?

</line>


<line>
Can you look at rainbows on your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne?

</line>


<line>
Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne pinging]

-Shit.

</line>


<line>
I just tweeted "Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,"

as <name type="PERSON">Cynthia</name> <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'd buy it. She is not a fan,

and for good reason.

</line>


<line>
-We were up in the <name type="ORG">Poconos</name>, she and I...

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, not now.

</line>


<line>
-What's up your butt tonight?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u really wanna know?

</line>


<line>
I would seriously like to know

what crawled up your butt,

</line>


<line>
made a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me for itself in your butt,

</line>


<line>
started a family, lived a fruitful life,

and then died up your butt.

</line>


<line>
I'm getting an abortion.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, that takes me back.

</line>


<line>
I had more than my share of abortions

in the '90s.

</line>


<line>
I didn't get them, I paid for them.

</line>


<line>
I really <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se women

actually got the abortions,

</line>


<line>
and didn't just keep my money.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, are you tweeting for pop starlet

<name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name> right now?

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to. Why?

</line>


<line>
Because her acco<name type="ORG">un</name>t

just tweeted out to 40 million followers,

</line>


<line>
"I'm getting an abortion."

</line>


<line>
What? No--

</line>


<line>
She--

</line>


<line>
Oh, balls.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he tweet heard ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the world.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name> says,

"I'm getting an abortion."

</line>


<line>
And the world says, "Whaaa?"

</line>


<line>
If it's happening,

we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> talk about it.

</line>


<line>
It's time for <name type="PERSON">T</name>om's <name type="PERSON">Ran</name>t.

</line>


<line>
Is <name type="PERSON">T</name>witter an appropriate forum

to be discussing a sensitive issue

like abortion?

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?

</line>


<line>
Wait, does that say "<name type="PERSON">T</name>om Srant"?

Why does that say <name type="PERSON">T</name>om Srant?

</line>


<line>
I clearly said--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ran</name>dy, don't look at <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name>.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is on you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, <name type="ORG">VIM</name> is hanging on by a thread

and only barely scraping by

because of clients like <name type="ORG">Sextina</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger

on the Big <name type="PERSON">Bea</name>r condo.

</line>


<line>
Great investment.

We are not on the edge of complete ruin.

</line>


<line>
We are on the edge of complete ruin.

</line>


<line>
I think if I explain it to her

and apologize, she'll <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
Because she's so <name type="ORG">un</name>derstanding?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a teenage pop star.

</line>


<line>
Literally the two least

compassionate entities

combined into the supernova

of not <name type="ORG">un</name>derstanding

</line>


<line>
-that is <name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name>.

-[elevator dings]

</line>


<line>
Ugh. So imagine my surprise

when I'm in the middle of a performance

for <name type="PERSON">Gaddafi</name>'s cousin on his yacht

and I'm in a giant champagne flute

singing "Left <name type="PERSON">T</name>itty"

and everyone starts to look

at their p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>nes and look at me,

because I am apparently aborting a baby

I do not have.

</line>


<line>
So I had them turn their boat into a car

and drive me here to fire someone.

</line>


<line>
-I think that's me.

-Great. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're fired, Glasses.

</line>


<line>
I'll put out a statement

explaining the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le mess. I am so sorry.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Oh!

</line>


<line>
What "oh?" W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> said you could <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>aylor Swift just tweeted

that you were "brave."

</line>


<line>
Nicki <name type="PERSON">Minaj</name> tweeted at you

a face with heart eyes.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">BuzzFeed</name> just posted a list

of top 15 celebrities

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have had abortions

like <name type="ORG">Sextina</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're trending like crazy.

-I'm trending?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>st women w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> go through this

never talk about it

because it's so stigmatized.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he fact that you're coming out like this

is huge.

</line>


<line>
It would be, if you were

actually getting an abortion.

</line>


<line>
So what you're saying is,

maybe I <ital>am </ital>getting an abortion?

</line>


<line>
Well, no, because you're not.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but if you did,

this would make you a cultural icon.

</line>


<line>
Glasses, you're <name type="ORG">un</name>-fired.

I'm getting an abortion.

</line>


<line>
-Well...

-I gotta go on talk s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ws.

</line>


<line>
If I can make one woman

feel a little less alone,

then it's all worth it, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah...

</line>


<line>
And if I can make a million women

buy my album,

then it's definitely all worth it.

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, take the yes.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name>, you are now the face

of the pro-c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice movement.

</line>


<line>
-Now let's get you informed.

-Hey! Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[crowd chattering]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, before the procedure,

you'll need to look at an ultraso<name type="ORG">un</name>d

and listen to the heartbeat.

</line>


<line>
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.

</line>


<line>
Why does she have to listen

to the heartbeat?

</line>


<line>
It's the law. Also, by law,

I have to tell you that at one month,

your puppies have a favorite color

and that color may be blue.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat can't be true.

-By law, I have to tell you that.

</line>


<line>
Also, before your procedure,

you'll need to watch

20 <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs of cute puppy videos

as <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> McLachlan's

"I Will Remember <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u" plays softly.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I will watch

the cute puppy videos for you.

</line>


<line>
-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

-No, she has to watch the videos.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, we will watch

the cute puppy videos together.

</line>


<line>
-No, she has to watch them alone.

<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, I have some terrible news.

Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser,

so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch?

</line>


<line>
No, I just meant because of thirst.

</line>


<line>
I could use a scotch.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

I don't think of him as a war criminal.

</line>


<line>
I just think of him as a person

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally. I think I'm getting

<line>
Someone put a baby in your belly

and now you're like,

</line>


<line>
"Awoo<name type="PERSON">ga</name>!

Is there an <name type="ORG">un</name>do button aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d here?

<line>
Leggo my preggo."

<line>
-Is that right?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is exactly correct, A <name type="PERSON">Ryan</name>,

but I am very excited for this opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity

to put a face on this important issue.

will have an abortion in her life.

I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,

</line>


<line>
would I put my life on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld

for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.

</line>


<line>
I can say that with confidence,

</line>


<line>
because I will never have to make

that decision, so I'm <name type="ORG">un</name>biased.

</line>


<line>
-Does this video glamorize abortion?

-Very possibly, <name type="PERSON">T</name>om.

</line>


<line>
Millennials today think everything is N<name type="ORG">BD</name>.

</line>


<line>
N<name type="ORG">BD</name> of course stands for No <name type="ORG">BD</name>,

referring to B.D. Wong,

</line>


<line>
w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> teens think is a very big deal.

</line>


<line>
So if something's not <name type="ORG">BD</name>,

it means it's not a big deal.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese days, abortions are not <name type="ORG">BD</name>.

-Are abortions even necessary?

</line>


<line>
I heard a theory that if a woman

really has an <name type="ORG">un</name>wanted pregnancy,

</line>


<line>
the body has a way to break the fetus down

into <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s particles

</line>


<line>
and then she can just fart it out.

</line>


<line>
Where did you hear this intriguing

"fart it out" theory?

</line>


<line>
-I don't remember. <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe the Bible?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for clarifying.

</line>


<line>
Next up, <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name> <name type="PERSON">Clooners</name>

is making audiences cry

</line>


<line>
in his new film, but his latest prank

might make you... think?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groaning]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<name type="PERSON">Jurj</name>. He likes pranks, huh?

</line>


<line>
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.

</line>


<line>
We'll need to draw him out.

What do A-list actors like?

</line>


<line>
Stretch limos? Nannies?

</line>


<line>
Flying their private jets

to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.

</line>


<line>
I'll need one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se caps,

I'll be the driver.

</line>


<line>
I'll pick him up,

and he'll be all like, "I'm <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name>, I suck,"

and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"

and hit him with a bat.

</line>


<line>
Pranked!

</line>


<line>
It really doesn't seem like a prank

as much as you hitting him with a bat.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose

to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w stupid pranks are.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the point.

-Is that the point?

Hey, man, just one <name type="ORG">sec</name>,

my publicist is right behind me.

</line>


<line>
Of course. Bring the publicist.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit.

-What's that, driver?

<line>
I said, "Auschwitz."

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the <name type="NORP">Nazi</name> w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> played Yahtzee.

Here I go. Driving, driving.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't need to talk,

you can just drive.

</line>


<line>
Actually, can we make a couple stops?

</line>


<line>
I am totally out of toilet paper,

so if you could find a <name type="ORG">Rite Aid</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have to go in and buy the <name type="PERSON">T</name>P for me.

I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.

Just pick out something

extra soft for my tushy.

</line>


<line>
-C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
My concern is that you're

actually giving the pro-life movement

something to latch onto

as an example of--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you are so boring.

</line>


<line>
Can I abort talking to you right now?

Abort.

</line>


<line>

-Or what? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> sic <name type="PERSON">Fido</name> on me?

I am just here for emotional support.

</line>

Can you let it go?

I don't want to have to ask you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
I really think we have the chance

to say something here,

and all we're saying

is "Pshew pshew pow."

My point is,

everyone's listening to you now.

</line>


<line>
Soon people are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get bored

and move onto the next thing

and you'll hate yourself

that you weren't able to make a difference

Seems a little convoluted,

which is actually a tra<name type="NORP">dem</name>ark

of a great prank.

</line>


<line>
Well played, sir.

</line>


<line>
No, it's a bad prank.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's my point. Pranks are dumb.

We're late, and I won't keep going

Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>om, abortion is a very serious subject.

How are you going to have

an abortion on live <name type="PERSON">T</name>V

when you're not even

really having an abortion?

</line>


<line>
-Duh, we'll just <ital><name type="ORG">Argo</name> </ital>that shit.

-What?

<line>
We'll book <name type="PERSON">Ed</name>die Redmayne as the fetus.

</line>


<line>
Are you hearing yourselves?

</line>


<line>
We're not going to fake an abortion

on live <name type="PERSON">T</name>V.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.

<line>

of the screen that says "Live."

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't think

this is incredibly disrespectful

Not if we do it tasteful.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, this is what the client wants.

Stop making it about you.

So morally bankrupt.

<line>
Okay, yeah, that was nice.

But still,

she is putting her company's bottom line

before the very real damage

is doing every time

I gotta take the high road,

go on the news and rat t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se suckers out.

It is if you think it is,

because I am here to support you

no matter what,

Like, if that idea were a <name type="PERSON">Di</name>llon brother

maybe it's a <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>, not a <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tt?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was surprisingly tasteful.

-And educational, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Weirdly educational.

</line>


<line>
I actually learned a lot about abortion,

and I just had an abortion.

</line>


<line>
-How are you feeling?

-I feel shitty.

</line>


<line>
I mean, physically.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I did it,

but mostly I just felt old.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here were all these teenagers there.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>wenty-somethings.

</line>


<line>
I know from the outside, it might seem

like I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be ready for kids,

but I can't--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, you don't need

to explain anything to anyone.

</line>

<line>
-<name type="ORG">Sextina</name>. Great job, we did it.

<ital>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I've been having a lot of sex, you know,

</line>


<line>
'cause I'm a sexual creature

and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.

</line>


<line>
I just fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out

I got knocked up for real.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-And I think I want to keep it.

</line>


<line>
But that might be a little confusing

to my fans,

since they just saw me

get the old scoopity doopity?

</line>


<line>
Okay, we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> handle this.

Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

</line>


<line>
First thing is we gotta get her

out of town before she starts to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm

where celebrities go to disappear,

where <name type="PERSON">Chad Michael Murray</name>

and <name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ra Birch went.

</line>


<line>
Film a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of music videos now,

and then--

</line>


<line>
Release them over the next year

so it seems like she's still aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen when she comes back,

we'll say she adopted a baby.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> People are going to love that.

[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
