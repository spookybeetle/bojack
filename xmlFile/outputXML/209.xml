<nonVerbComm>[thunder rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Sir, you can't send me to <name type="GPE">Vietnam</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>]</nonVerbComm> I can do whatever I want.

</line>


<line>
I'm president of the goddamn

United States of <name type="GPE">America</name>.

</line>


<line>
Isn't that right, Checkers?

</line>


<line>
That's what it says

on your business cards.

</line>


<line>
There are going to be riots

in the streets.

</line>


<line>
I'm Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
You think I'm afraid

of a few rioting hippies?

</line>


<line>
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

</line>


<line>
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

</line>


<line>
Please, I'll do anything.

</line>


<line>
You gotta send someone else

in my place.

</line>


<line>
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...

arranged.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.</ital>

<ital>My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>which is necessary</ital>

<ital>to protect our way of life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And another hero is President <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He is one groovy dude.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> Groovy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What the hell are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, <name type="PERSON">Mommy</name>!

</line>


<line>
Don't you dare put that out.

</line>


<line>
That is a perfectly good cigarette,

and you are going to finish it.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna.

</line>


<line>
And I don't want to be

the mother of a quitter.

</line>


<line>
Finish it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ, you can't even smoke

a cigarette right.

</line>


<line>
Don't you dare cry,

don't you ever cry.

</line>


<line>
You wanted this.

</line>


<line>
Are you punishing me for smoking

or for stealing?

</line>


<line>
I'm punishing you for being alive.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Uh, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>? You really shouldn't throw

a lit cigarette off the--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[fire roaring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Fine. I'll call 911.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
The fire department got

everything under control,

</line>


<line>
but the cable's out

for the neighborhood.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand

what started the fire.

</line>


<line>
Nobody knows where fires come from,

it's a mystery.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I am fired up

about my first day back on set.

</line>


<line>
We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> finish

that big <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> scene.

</line>


<line>
We were just one shot away

before we went on hiatus.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know.

You told me at breakfast.

</line>


<line>
Why did you call me?

</line>


<line>
Usually I talk to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>

on the way to work,

</line>


<line>
but she abandoned me to teach piano

in <name type="PERSON">Cordovia</name> or something.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me

because <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> wasn't available.

</line>


<line>
You bet. Oh, man, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> kill

in this <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> scene.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be in "da" house.

</line>


<line>
In da <name type="PERSON">White</name> <name type="ORG">House</name>.

</line>


<line>
What happened to da house set?

<name type="ORG">Da <name type="PERSON">White</name> <name type="ORG">House</name></name> set?

</line>


<line>
-Things changed a little.

-You cut the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> scene?

</line>


<line>
The <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> scene is the core

of the whole movie.

</line>


<line>
Where we see Secretariat

be morally corrupted

and get to look

into the real darkness of his soul.

</line>


<line>
It's still all that,

except now it happens

while you give a Christmas present

to your nieces

and they hug you

while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

</line>


<line>
Is one of the nieces <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>?

</line>


<line>
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

</line>


<line>
People don't want

all that controversial stuff.

</line>


<line>
But we were supposed to make

a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
-Warts and all.

-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

</line>


<line>
That's why they took the gay stuff

out of <ital>A Beautiful Mind.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Know that guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> spent 12 years

as a slave?

</line>


<line>
They don't talk about the 60 years

he spent as a jerk.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>, you're okay with this?

-Eh...

</line>


<line>
That's showbiz.

</line>


<line>
See, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

that's the shrug of a pro w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> gets it.

</line>


<line>
Good shrugging, kid.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

</line>


<line>
That's the end of your name.

We need to talk.

</line>


<line>
We'll meet in the supply closet

in one minute. Break!

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, ow.

</line>


<line>
Carolyn, when you're in the throes

of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

along with all that pain and degradation

comes a certain perfect clarity,

and right now that clarity is telling me

that you and I should get out of here.

</line>


<line>
Well, what do you mean,

"get out of here"?

</line>


<line>
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,

and I want you to be my partner in crime.

</line>


<line>
What? But I can't just leave <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name>.

</line>


<line>
I've been here 20 years.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> water the plants?

</line>


<line>
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

</line>


<line>
I started doing it as an intern,

but then no one told me to stop,

so it's still kind of my job.

</line>


<line>
Carolyn,

you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

</line>


<line>
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

</line>


<line>
Things are so crazy

for me right now. I--

</line>


<line>
Don't give me that, you want crazy.

"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

and your second favorite

<name type="PERSON">Gnarls Barkley</name> song.

</line>


<line>
I don't want crazy.

</line>


<line>
I've got five episodes

of <ital>The Good Wife </ital>piled up on my DVR,

and I just want a night off

to enjoy them.

</line>


<line>
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess

I could just go to <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[Carolyn] <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>?!

-But I'd rather look at you all day.

</line>


<line>
You're an amazing agent.

And you're bright, and you're f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I think we could make something

really special.

</line>


<line>
We weren't doing anything!

We were just looking for closet supplies.

</line>


<line>
Are you the person to talk to

about unclogging the toilet?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>, I'm your boss.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but you're the one

in the janitor's closet, so...

</line>


<line>
-What, I'm the idiot?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>The first thing you notice</ital>

<ital>about <name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name> St. Clair</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is that he speaks in paragraphs.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Even I can't believe

how much good we've done here,

and I'll believe almost anything.

</line>


<line>
In the last six weeks,

we dug a new well, built a school,

and next month

the community center is doing <ital>Seussical.</ital>

</line>


<line>
There we go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>In his previous life,</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name> owned</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>a chain of high-end department stores.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I want to stock up on muffs.

</line>


<line>
We're going to sell a lot of muffs

this winter. Huzzah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, I lived a life

of power and luxury,

and then my picture

was in the newspaper.

</line>


<line>
-A real-life newspaper!

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
But I knew my life was empty.

</line>


<line>
<ital>At night I heard the cries</ital>

<ital>of children sick and dying.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I would scream into the night.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Shut up! Shut up, children!

</line>


<line>
<ital>But the phantom cries would not abate.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And so I began my travels,

with little more than a compass,

a yearning for adventure,

and several crates full of unsold muffs.

</line>


<line>
I knew there were people out there

just waiting for my help.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, this is <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>.

</line>


<line>
I am <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>.

</line>


<line>
In his language, it means,

orphan whose parents were murdered

by rebels and will die <name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung,

probably from malaria.

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>. I'm <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
It means,

my parents liked the show <ital>Cheers.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Cheers! </ital>Oh, you're good.

You're very good.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>When <name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name> St. Clair says</ital>

<ital>you're good,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you want to believe</ital>

<ital>that you really are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That you, like <name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name>, are part</ital>

<ital>of something bigger than just yourself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And for a moment,</ital>

<ital>you feel like you are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name> made a mess.

</line>


<line>
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is

way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

</line>


<line>
And cut. Neat.

</line>


<line>
-Let's break for lunch.

-[kids] Oh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>, this is a nightmare.

</line>


<line>
I had to touch three children today,

and one of them was sticky.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it was you.

Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, there's nothing we can do.

-No, this isn't you.

</line>


<line>
I've seen everything you've done.

</line>


<line>
Your films are challenging and gritty,

and they're great.

</line>


<line>
I'm not just saying that

because they're full of lesbians.

</line>


<line>
Look, even if I wanted to finish

that <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> scene,

we don't have an <name type="ORG">Oval Office</name> set.

</line>


<line>
There's one at the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> Library

in Yorba <name type="PERSON">Linda</name>.

</line>


<line>
Why on earth do you know that?

</line>


<line>
In season three of <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around,</ital>

the horse got elected president

and we shot on location.

</line>


<line>
We can sneak into the library

and get the shot, guerilla-style.

</line>


<line>
Once Turteltaub sees it,

he'll love it,

and we can make the movie

we both want to make.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.

-All right!

</line>


<line>
Did they really make

your character president?

</line>


<line>
Only for season three.

</line>


<line>
In season four, it turned out

it was all a dream.

</line>


<line>
They called my airplane <ital>Air Horse One.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And the vice president was

a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

</line>


<line>
-Come on.

-It wasn't our best season.

</line>


<line>
But on the bright side,

was not our worst.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Step one, we go to the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> Library...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and steal the scale model.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man as <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>]</nonVerbComm> Welcome to my library.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>. [chuckles].

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[in normal voice]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, you know,

some people say I look like <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>


<line>
Not because he's my dad or anything.

That's crazy. <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>'s not my dad.

</line>


<line>
But if you have any questions about <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>,

I'd be happy to answer them.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

</line>


<line>
Is that the lighted exit sign

from <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>'s boyhood home?

</line>


<line>
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

</line>


<line>
-Is that...

-Here we go.

</line>


<line>
...the handicapped drinking fountain

he used in the <name type="PERSON">White</name> <name type="ORG">House</name>?

</line>


<line>
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

</line>


<line>
-Hang on.

-One more.

</line>


<line>
-Is that the smoke alarm--?

-No.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles nervously]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So the <name type="ORG">Oval Office</name> is right here,

next to the men's room.

</line>


<line>
I remember because season three

of<ital> <name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around </ital>was a big cocaine year.

</line>


<line>
All the pressures of being president.

</line>


<line>
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.

-We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> need a crack team.

</line>


<line>
First, we gotta get

the best lock-pick in the city.

</line>


<line>
-Not interested.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The second best lock-pick in the city.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No way I'm doing that.

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
<ital>A lock-pick.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Todd, can you pick locks?

</line>


<line>
-Kind of.

-Great. You're in.

</line>


<line>
<ital>We'll need an expert cat burglar.</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right, <ital>Good Wife,</ital>

let's see what you got.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hey, Princess Carolyn!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> and I are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> break

into the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> library

to steal a shot

for our Secretariat movie.

</line>


<line>
It's a super-sneaky, <name type="PERSON">kooky caper</name>

that stands to benefit you in no way.

</line>


<line>
Are you in?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Hey! Shut up down there!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] You shut up!

-[man] Make me!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hey, you got a problem?

Take it up with my agent,

your downstairs neighbor

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>We'll need someone to play Checkers.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>! <name type="PERSON">Al Capone</name>, deep dish.

</line>


<line>
What does <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'd love to help you out,

but I'm super-busy recording promos

for television's

highest-rated new game show.

</line>


<line>
-We can probably do it without you.

-This next one's for <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>! <name type="ORG">Space Needle</name>, <name type="ORG">Starbucks</name>.

</line>


<line>
What does <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Rain.

</line>


<line>
It's too bad though because I could

really bring a lot to this project.

</line>


<line>
The more I think about it,

Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

</line>


<line>
It's just a single on Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="GPE">Waco</name>, Texas! Terrible tragedy.

What does <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Hawke know?

</line>


<line>
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.

-You know what? Forget I even asked.

</line>


<line>
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Character actress Margo Martindale,

you've been a model prisoner.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I served my time.

</line>


<line>
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

and get back to doing small roles

in critically-acclaimed films

and television shows.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[prison guard]</nonVerbComm> Watch, purse, lipstick,

</line>


<line>
Emmy Award

for Best Guest Actress.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs deeply]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I need your help with a break-in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I've been out of prison

for two minutes.

</line>


<line>
What took you so long?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[tires squealing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>, Mr. Peanutbutter and I

are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> break into the library.

</line>


<line>
But the problem is,

the place is crawling with cops.

</line>


<line>
They're on high alert

because some idiot

stole this model last night.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> am I kidding?

I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

</line>


<line>
Look at your big saucer eyes.

I can go swimming in them!

</line>


<line>
-Totally.

-Now, we need to lose the cops.

</line>


<line>
The rest of you will create a diversion

by breaking into the only other place

in Yorba <name type="PERSON">Linda</name> of cultural significance:

<name type="ORG">the Discount Fine Art Gallery</name>

in the strip mall,

between the tanning salon

and the adult bookstore.

</line>


<line>
Once you set off the alarm,

all the cops will go there.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Now, things could get ugly.

One of you is very likely to die.

</line>


<line>
-Possibly <name type="PERSON">Alan</name>.

-Why possibly <name type="PERSON">Alan</name>?

</line>


<line>
Well, you are the guy

none of us knows that well.

</line>


<line>
I just came to fix your cable.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alan</name>, you already know too much.

You're a part of this now, like it or not.

</line>


<line>
-But--

-Hey, you think you could keep it down?

</line>


<line>
I'm reading a script

and I'm having trouble focusing,

so now my notes are

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be confusing and vague.

</line>


<line>
We're almost done.

</line>


<line>
I know you're having f<name type="ORG">un</name>

with your police cars,

</line>


<line>
I just wish you would have asked

before you invited these people over.

</line>


<line>
-I live here, too.

-You're right. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
And can you at least let <name type="PERSON">Alan</name>

fix the cable before he dies?

</line>


<line>
I can't die. I'm endangered!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">"And</name> the truffle-infused gnocchi

was the star dish

at this up-and-comer that will please

the pickiest of <name type="GPE">Brooklynites</name>

and the less discerning <name type="NORP">Staten Islander</name>."

</line>


<line>
When I grow up, I can be food critic

for <ital><name type="GPE">New York</name>er?</ital>

</line>


<line>
You can do anything you want in life.

</line>


<line>
Not everyone can write for <ital>The <name type="GPE">New York</name>er,</ital>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name>]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

</line>


<line>
I'm concerned you're spending

a lot of time with this sickly child.

</line>


<line>
Remember, you're supposed

to be writing about me.

</line>


<line>
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?

To help these people?

</line>


<line>
I'm here to help these people.

</line>


<line>
You're here to help me help them

by writing a book about me

so people back home will give money

to my foundation.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[alarm wailing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

</line>


<line>
One of us isn't going

to come out of this alive.

</line>


<line>
Why do you all keep saying that?

</line>

make it out alive and go from there?

<name type="PERSON">Alan</name>, we've got enough problems without

worrying about your imminent death.

</line>


<line>
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

</line>


<line>
Why does everything have to be

a big, complicated mess?

</line>


<line>
Like,

look at this <name type="PERSON">T</name>homas Kinkade painting.

</line>


<line>
It's simple.

</line>


<line>
And serene. And... pleasant.

Remember when my character

</line>


<line>
-elected president?

-Let me guess, it was all a dream?

</line>


<line>
No, I served half a term,

then resigned

because when Zachary

had a bad time with peer pressure,

</line>


<line>
I realized I was spending

too much time being president

and not enough time being a dad.

</line>


<line>
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'd like you here.

</line>


<line>
And then you are going to be over here.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Freeze</name>!

-I'm union.

</line>


<line>
-Playing dead.

-Breaking and entering?

</line>


<line>
That is against everything

<name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> stood for.

</line>


<line>
We didn't mean to cause trouble.

We're trying to make a movie about <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? What, another leftist screed

about how corrupt he was?

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Or is it about how he had

an illegitimate son,

and the son never knew w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> his dad was,

but always had a hunch it was <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>,

and then that son grew up to be

the security guard at the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> Library?

</line>


<line>
The second one?

</line>


<line>
Well, if that's true, how come you don't

have an actor here to play <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>?

</line>


<line>
Because...

we couldn't find anyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> could

appropriately capture his magic.

</line>


<line>
You know, I do a pretty good <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>


<line>
You? No way.

<nonVerbComm>[as <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hello, I'm <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>

I can't be at your soccer game, but I am

Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. He's perfect.

</line>


<line>
We've found our <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[in normal voice]</nonVerbComm> I can be ready in five.

</line>


<line>
Uh. Did we get the shot?

</line>


<line>
It's so peaceful.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, folks.

-[all] Aah!

</line>


<line>
Party's over.

That's something we say at <name type="ORG">CrossFit</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Wait a <name type="ORG">sec</name>-- I know you!

</line>


<line>
You were in <ital>Justified.</ital>

You were amazing.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you caught me.

</line>


<line>
I am kind of

a well-known character actress.

</line>


<line>
I am such a huge fan, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name>, uh--

</line>


<line>
What--? What's your name?

</line>


<line>
Sure, of course.

</line>


<line>
Everyone loves my work,

but apparently not enough

to watch the credits

and find out what my name is.

</line>


<line>
The important thing is that we enjoy

your great performances, right?

</line>


<line>
-How about you enjoy this? Aah!

-[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

</line>


<line>
Oh, is that what we agreed to?

I thought we said "no gum."

</line>


<line>
But you're also chewing gum.

</line>


<line>
I'm a wild card.

</line>


<line>
-Aah!

-Return fire!

</line>


<line>
Watch out!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! <name type="PERSON">Alan</name>'s dead!

</line>


<line>
No, I'm fine.

The bullet hit my cell phone.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! <name type="PERSON">Alan</name>'s cell phone is dead!

</line>


<line>
Nope, phone's fine, too.

Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

</line>


<line>
She's going into labor.

Guys, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a dad!

</line>


<line>
See you later!

<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>.

How did you get in this painting?

</line>


<line>
I'm your servant, of course.

</line>


<line>
In your infinite generosity,

you gave me this job

when it became clear

that I don't have what it takes

to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

</line>


<line>
Also, my husband left me.

</line>


<line>
And my children married each other

in an <name type="ORG">un</name>holy incestuous union.

</line>


<line>
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

</line>


<line>
How appropriate!

Fetch me drink, wench.

</line>


<line>
-Right away, ma'am.

-Ah.

<ital>about <name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name> St. Clair</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is how much he talks about himself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
This way is the library I built.

</line>


<line>
And over there is the statue

of me building the library.

</line>


<line>
And on that wall is a painting

of me posing for the statue.

</line>


<line>
-Put a chapter in your book about that.

Everybody--

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hose of you w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can walk, I mean.

</line>


<line>
--let's drag these corpses

to the mass grave behind the playground.

</line>


<line>
We need to make room

for my new hospital.

</line>


<line>
-Where's <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>? Is he okay?

-Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

</line>


<line>
See, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

I told you not to make friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, you don't care

about any of these people.

</line>


<line>
You're just using them as props

for your big-shot superhero act.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, the dead will not benefit

from our grief,

but the survivors need a new hospital

and we need to build it.

</line>


<line>
This is too much.

</line>


<line>
If you're going to survive,

you'll need to harden up.

</line>


<line>
I asked you to join me

because I thought you could handle it.

</line>


<line>
-But if you can't, you can go home.

-I...

</line>


<line>
I can handle it.

</line>


<line>
Great! Let's drag some bodies!

<name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>! Oh, never mind.

</line>


<line>
Hey, um, how come <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> gets a line

and I don't get a line?

</line>


<line>
We only gave him a line

so he wouldn't call the police.

</line>


<line>
-If I call the police, will I get a line?

-No, we won't use it in the movie.

</line>


<line>
We only need the one-shot of me.

</line>


<line>
I just think if he gets a line,

I should get a line.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh. Actors.

-Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[as <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>]</nonVerbComm> I'm <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name>.

</line>


<line>
The way you're feeling

about your dead brother is how I feel

about the son I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
But I look at the moon and so does he.

That's how I know we're connected.

</line>


<line>
And I'm Checkers.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>]</nonVerbComm> All right, so, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

you've been told

that your brother, Jeffretariat,

the one <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> sent to <name type="GPE">Vietnam</name>

in your place, is dead.

</line>


<line>
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

</line>


<line>
And the tears start to flow.

</line>


<line>
And the tears start to flow.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

</line>


<line>
Well, you need to.

This is the emotional climax of the movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front

of other people. I can't.

</line>


<line>
Really, never? Come on.

</line>


<line>
What if someone tells you

they'll take you to the park,

and they keep talking about the park

and all the f<name type="ORG">un</name> you'll have,

but then... [sobs]

</line>


<line>
But then they don't take you to the park.

I need a second.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

</line>


<line>
Can you give us the room, please?

</line>


<line>
There's a park right outside

we can hang out at.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

</line>

Ah.

Well, another beautiful, serene day

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,

I have some exciting news.

</line>


<line>
I just landed a new client.

</line>


<line>
-The mill owner!

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
We're doing a three-picture deal

about his waterwheel.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, you're making deals here?

-I'll say.

</line>


<line>
I'm now the biggest agent

in the entire idyllic New <name type="GPE">England</name> village.

</line>


<line>
It's like you don't even read

the idyllic New <name type="GPE">England</name> village trades.

</line>


<line>
What? No!

</line>


<line>
You're polluting my perfect serene

dream life. Why is this happening?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

</line>


<line>
But if you ask me, I don't think

you want perfect and serene

and enough time to catch up

on <ital>The Good Wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Stop kidding yourself,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
If you really wanted the simple life,

you'd have a simple life.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

these six months are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> fly by.

</line>


<line>

I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry for everything.

I don't know what I'm doing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, sit down.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You've just been told your brother is dead

and that it's your fault.

</line>


<line>
But this moment is bigger than that.

</line>


<line>
This is the moment

that Secretariat stops running.

</line>


<line>
Because this is the moment you realize

something inside you is broken,

and it can never be fixed.

</line>


<line>
We got it.

</line>


<line>
Really? I didn't cry.

</line>


<line>
You didn't have to.

Turteltaub's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> love this.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. All right.

-Thanks for talking me into this.

</line>


<line>
Just so you know, I'm really glad

we're making this movie together.

</line>


<line>
-Didn't know I had it in me, did you?

-No, I knew.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>

-Coming in?

-I'm all in.

-Whoa!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mommy</name>, it's nearly Christmas.

Where's Uncle Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
He had to go win a race

against the Russians.

</line>


<line>
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

</line>


<line>
-Hey, where's <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>?

-Oh, yeah, funny story.

</line>


<line>
Turns out you two knuckleheads

snuck out last night

and got that shot

I told you not to get for the scene

</line>


<line>
-that's not in the movie anymore.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Silly</name> me, I didn't like that.

So I fired her ass.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-We got a movie to finish, okay?

</line>


<line>
So, go get in costume,

get your butt up that chimney,

and do your thing, Hamlet.

Just maybe,

all we have to do is believe!
