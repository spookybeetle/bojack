  <title>What <name type="ORG">Time</name> Is It Right Now - <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name></title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I got into</ital>

<ital>this business because I love stories.</ital>

</line>


<line>
They comfort us, they inspire us,

they create a context

for how we experience the world.

</line>


<line>
But also, you have to be careful,

because if you spend

a lot of time with stories,

you start to believe that life

is just stories, and it's not.

</line>


<line>
Life is life, and that's so sad,

because there's so little time and...

what are we doing with it?

</line>


<line>
-[clocks ticking]

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
When Princess Carolyn told me

we were pitching

to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

</line>


<line>
I was excited,

because in so many ways,

the story I'm about to tell is about time.

</line>


<line>
And it's about time this story was told.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh!

-Ahh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Philbert,</ital>

<ital>a man from another time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>But now he finds himself</ital>

<ital>in a new time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, did you say newt time?

-No, no, new time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
Unless you want it to be

a time full of newts.

</line>


<line>
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
He finds himself in a time

he doesn't understand.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[phone dialing]

</line>


<line>
-[man] <ital>Don't call this number again.</ital>

-Wait. I-- I just--

</line>


<line>
My mother, she's senile,

and she was drugging the coffee.

</line>


<line>
That's why-- Just--

</line>


<line>
I wanted you to know that

none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Goodbye, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>A time in which he is alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Perhaps, all this time,</ital>

<ital>he's been alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Except for the newts, right?

-Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Except for the newts.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And then it dawns on him,

his partner isn't a ghost.

</line>


<line>
Or is he?

</line>


<line>
-Wow!

-As we like to say here,

</line>


<line>
there are little hand ideas

and big hand ideas.

</line>


<line>
And that's a big hand idea.

</line>


<line>
And you said <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>

is attached?

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, yeah.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is attached.

</line>


<line>
But he's not like "attached" attached.

</line>


<line>
If you want us

to get somebody better--

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no, no.

We love <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. We don't wanna do this

without <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, just to be clear.

</line>


<line>
-Well--

-Oh, he's definitely attached.

</line>


<line>
He signed a contract. I saw it myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

[gulps]

</line>


<line>
So if you look to the left, you'll see

a charming little breakfast nook.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-[gasps] Look at that!

</line>


<line>
But if you want more natural light,

</line>


<line>
you could knock down that wall

and put in these...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="NORP">French</name> doors!

-That is so cool!

</line>


<line>
-You actually don't have to yell.

-Wait, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Are we in the same house right now?

I don't see you.

</line>


<line>
I can hear you.

I think we're close!

</line>


<line>
You can't see each other

in the program.

</line>


<line>
So I'm invisible?

Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?

</line>


<line>
Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

</line>


<line>
who cannot rest until

his final letter is delivered!

</line>


<line>
And can I be

<name type="PERSON">Anne</name> of Green Gables?

</line>


<line>
No, you're both still you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, can I talk to you alone

for a moment?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I can step out--

-Sure!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you meet me

in the guest bathroom? Ow!

</line>


<line>
-You don't have to.

-Where's--

</line>


<line>
-Hold on. I think--

-Guys, I can just--

</line>


<line>
-Here we are.

-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

</line>


<line>
No. Careful. Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Do you really love this house?

-Yeah, it's fine.

</line>


<line>
I didn't love the old house,

but it was your house and I moved in,

and it was great.

</line>


<line>
But this is an opportunity

to build something together.

</line>


<line>
Something that'll last

for the rest of our lives.

</line>


<line>
Anything you want is gonna be good

with me. Just like your old house.

</line>


<line>
But I don't want this to just be

another one of <ital>my</ital> houses.

</line>


<line>
I want this to be <ital>our</ital> house.

</line>


<line>
And it will be,

because we'll both be living in it.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I don't need anything fancy.

</line>


<line>
All that matters to me

is that I get to live with you.

</line>


<line>
-In the real world.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
No more campaign,

no more ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
Just Peanutbutter,

back to normal.

</line>


<line>
-For the rest of our lives.

-That sounds great.

</line>


<line>
-We'll take it.

-One second, though,

</line>


<line>
-I have to use the bathroom.

-No, no, no, that's not--

</line>


<line>
<ital>You completely humiliated me</ital>

<ital>in front of Sha Na Na!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[The Horse]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>How was I supposed to Sha Na know</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>they were going to invite me</ital>

<ital>on the stage to do a guitar solo?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>You're supposed to be my dad.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're supposed to be</ital>

<ital>looking out for me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>You're the worst dad in the world!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[The Horse]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Well, too bad</ital>

<ital>I'm the only dad you got.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[doorbell chimes]

-[both] <ital>Huh?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[The Horse]</nonVerbComm> <ital>O.J. Simpson lawyer</ital>

<ital>and DNA expert <name type="PERSON">Barry</name> Scheck?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Scheck] <ital>My car broke down.</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>] <ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Scheck]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I guess it ran out of... juice.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

</line>


<line>
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.

</line>


<line>
Don't put me on hold.

Just take a message--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Wait, wait!</ital>

<ital>You're a DNA expert?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Could I use DNA</ital>

<ital>to find my real family?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Scheck]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Well, sometimes,</ital>

<ital>DNA can be a tricky thing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Like, for example,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>was Simpson DNA found at the scene</ital>

<ital>of the murder of <name type="PERSON">Nicole</name> <name type="PERSON">Brown</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sure. Was it O.J. Simpson's DNA?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Who's to say?</ital>

<ital>-Oh.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Maybe it was some other Simpson,</ital>

<ital>like his son, or his father.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>There's no way to know.</ital>

<ital>I wouldn't worry about it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's too much, man--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell chimes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Hey, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Uh-oh.

-She had a long day... of drinking.

</line>


<line>
I figured she shouldn't

drive herself home.

</line>


<line>
-Good thinking.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I was right too,

because she crashed her car.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I probably should've

said something, but...

</line>


<line>
You need to get your shit together.

</line>


<line>
Wha-- Where am I?

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you know how you're always

giving pep talks to people,

telling them they need

to get their shit together?

</line>


<line>
Well, this is me giving you

the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

</line>


<line>
-Why am I tied up in the woods?

-So you can't escape my wise words.

</line>


<line>
Is that not part of it?

I couldn't remember.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter.

It's all over for me.

</line>


<line>
When it gets out

I faked <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s signature,

the deal's gonna fall apart.

</line>


<line>
There goes my reputation, my career--

</line>


<line>
Well, there's more to life

than just your career, isn't there?

</line>


<line>
-Is there?

-Isn't there?

</line>


<line>
I have nothing!

</line>


<line>
Oh! This pep talk is going

in the wrong direction.

</line>


<line>
Do you know how hard it is

to start a family at my age?

</line>


<line>
-To find a guy at my age?

-You don't need a guy to start a family.

</line>


<line>
You're Princess Carolyn.

You can do anything.

</line>


<line>
No, I can't.

</line>


<line>
Look, the woods are dark and scary,

but the only way out is through.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

I got distracted by the woods.

</line>


<line>
-Um, what were we talking about?

-No, you're right.

</line>


<line>
The only way out is through.

</line>


<line>
I gotta talk to <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

</line>


<line>
I'm Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
That's the spirit!

</line>


<line>
As my blood type always says,

"B" positive!

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Doctor <name type="PERSON">Picarello</name>.

-[groaning]

</line>


<line>
Doctor <name type="PERSON">Picarello</name>, are you okay?

</line>


<line>
-[growling]

-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

</line>


<line>
-[all snarling]

-[drill whirring]

</line>


<line>
So it turns out Vice Chancellor

<name type="PERSON">Laughing Gassy</name> got rabies

from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

</line>


<line>
And then he started biting everyone,

and now a bunch of them have rabies.

</line>


<line>
Who could have predicted

my innocent clown dentist venture

</line>


<line>
-could turn into something so terrifying?

-I don't see how this concerns me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>, the only reason

they're in the woods at all

is because of you.

</line>


<line>
If people find out the Better

Business Bureau is behind this,

you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

from the Business Branch

of the Board of Better Bureaus?

</line>


<line>
You're right! We have to do something

before someone gets hurt.

</line>


<line>
Call me four out of five dentists,

because I agree.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Here we are.

The rest of our lives.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, wow.

</line>


<line>
-Do you wanna go to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>?

-What? Right now?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! When's the last time

we did something impulsive?

</line>


<line>
Well, you did run for governor

without giving it much--

</line>


<line>
I just think we could use a vacation.

Things have been so crazy this last year.

</line>


<line>
Before we start the rest of our lives,

haven't we earned a break?

</line>


<line>
All right. Let's go to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>! They got

that bridge that's just sitting there.

</line>


<line>
-We might as well use it.

-All right! <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>, here we come!

</line>


<line>
-All right! <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>!

-<name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>!

</line>


<line>
-[horns honking]

-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter sighs]

-[gulls squawking]

</line>


<line>
So, listen.

</line>


<line>
As you know, one of the differences

between agents and managers--

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Stop. Please stop.

-I'm producing a new TV show.

</line>


<line>
It's a phenomenal script which may

or may not involve ghost or newts.

</line>


<line>
-Does it involve ghost or newts?

-It may!

</line>


<line>
-You haven't read it, have you?

-Read it? I'm producing it!

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

</line>


<line>
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.

-Right, well--

</line>


<line>
They're impossible to figure out.

</line>


<line>
Then all of a sudden, some random detail

makes the hero remember a conversation

that totally re-contextualizes everything,

and then it all magically comes together.

</line>


<line>
-Sure, but--

-It's such bullshit.

</line>


<line>
Where's my random detail that's gonna

suddenly make everything make sense?

</line>


<line>
Because I would love that.

</line>


<line>
Well, this script is really special,

and everyone wants to play the lead,

from Matthew McConaughey

to Matthew Perry.

</line>


<line>
-Matthew Perry?

-Yeah. But I was thinking--

</line>


<line>
Hold on. Matthew Perry...

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, which one

of these pictures more says,

</line>


<line>
"This daughter looks like a cool lady

that I wanna have in my life"?

</line>


<line>
Why do you ask?

</line>


<line>
I'm writing a letter to my mom

and I want to include a picture.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to send it

to the adoption agency.

</line>


<line>
Maybe if they still have her address

on file, they can forward it to her.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a long shot. How about

a better strategy is, don't do that,

and then you won't be disappointed

when it doesn't work out?

</line>


<line>
I'm trying everything.

I don't wanna look back at this

and feel like the end

of "<name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>'s List," you know?

</line>


<line>
-You mean <ital>Schindler's List</ital>.

-Never saw it.

</line>


<line>
I'm talking about "<name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>'s List,"

the sketch from when Matthew Perry

hosted <ital>SNL.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Remind me?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
So it's <name type="PERSON">Chandler</name> from <ital>Friends,</ital>

and it's World War II,

and he's got this list.

</line>


<line>
And the whole time, he's like,

"I'm <name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>!

</line>


<line>
Could I <ital>have</ital> a bigger list?"

</line>


<line>
But then at the end, the war's over,

and he's like...

</line>


<line>
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"

-Whoa.

</line>


<line>
He's haunted because he feels

like he could have done more.

</line>


<line>
You know, he's like,

</line>


<line>
"Could I <ital>be</ital> any more feeling

like I could have done more?"

</line>


<line>
I have to go.

</line>


<line>
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!

[groans]

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh. [gasps]

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
-[snarling]

-[music playing]

</line>


<line>
Shh!

</line>


<line>
Yes. Get the magazine.

</line>


<line>
What a fine addition

to your waiting room.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no!

-Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-[clown growling]

</line>


<line>
What are we gonna do, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Guys, let's talk this out.

-[drill whirring]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horn honking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Run. Ouchie! Ouchie!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, man.

-I've never run that fast in my life.

</line>


<line>
-Me neither.

-I gotta get in better shape.

</line>


<line>
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,

but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.

</line>


<line>
-[horns honking]

-[tires screeching]

</line>


<line>
-Can you not start and stop so much?

-I can't control the traffic, darling.

</line>


<line>
When the car in front of me starts,

I start. And when it stops, I stop.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you don't have to start

every time the car in front of you starts,

because you know it's gonna

stop again anyway.

</line>


<line>
-You could leave a little space.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-[engine rumbles]

-And another car just cut in front of me

because I left a little space.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.

</line>


<line>
All right. I got the lowdown.

</line>


<line>
First of all, very important,

I got you this flattened penny.

</line>


<line>
I will cherish it always.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.

-Don't worry about it.

</line>


<line>
Here's the deal.

</line>


<line>
With this traffic,

we can stay on our current trajectory

and get to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name> just in time

to spend two luxurious hours

at the <name type="GPE">Honolulu</name> <name type="PERSON">Stilton</name>,

and then turn around and come back,

or we can hang out here

at the Thrifty Lodge

at this charming halfway to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>

rest area and gas park.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

we would like your finest room, please.

</line>


<line>
-All our rooms are the same.

-What kind of cuisine is on premises?

</line>


<line>
There's a deli at the gas station

across the street.

</line>


<line>
-And what are your spa hours?

-There's no spa.

</line>


<line>
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,

could I use your grand ballroom for that,

or is that booked months in advance?

</line>


<line>
I could settle for a demi-ballroom

in a pinch,

but attire will be formal,

I don't wanna upstage the venue.

</line>


<line>
We have zero ballrooms

in this Thrifty Lodge.

</line>


<line>
I see. This will do nicely.

</line>


<line>
Didn't you tell me once

you always wanted a ballroom?

</line>


<line>
Actually, no. [chuckles]

What I wanted was a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room.

</line>


<line>
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

</line>


<line>
It's a room full of big books,

with big windows and a ladder,

like Beast.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-And it's called a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room?

-It's called a library.

</line>


<line>
But I called it a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room

because it was magical.

</line>


<line>
And since it was a name I made up

for a room that wasn't real,

that meant that it was just mine.

</line>


<line>
That's adora-<name type="ORG">Belle</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[woman] Hey, <name type="ORG">Seaborn</name>! <name type="ORG">Seaborn</name>!

-What's that?

</line>


<line>
You're <name type="ORG">Seaborn</name>'s Seahorse Milk, right?

</line>


<line>
Ha! That's right.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

</line>


<line>
That's like a shellfish version

of a selfie.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm?

-Go, take a picture.

</line>


<line>
It'll make their day.

</line>


<line>
-You sure? You don't mind?

-I'll be in the room.

</line>


<line>
Don't stay out

with your new friends too late.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.

What other of my things do you like?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Wow, yeah!

</line>


<line>
Okay, so...

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="GPE">Jose</name>]</nonVerbComm> So the supplier said,

"I really oughta give <name type="GPE">Iowa</name> a try."

</line>


<line>
But I said, "Buddy, <name type="GPE">Kansas</name> City's

about as far as I can go."

</line>


<line>
Long story short,

we're meeting in St. Louis.

</line>


<line>
-[pounding on door]

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-I need to talk to Hollyhock!

</line>


<line>
-She's not here.

-You have to let me see her.

</line>


<line>
Please, I flew all the way here

and it's <name type="GPE">Wichita</name>,

so it's not like

I got other shit to do in <name type="GPE">Wichita</name>.

</line>


<line>
No one told you to come here.

</line>


<line>
You're the one

who likes foreign movies, right?

</line>


<line>
That part in <ital>Amelie,</ital>

where she listens to the guy's story?

</line>


<line>
This is that part.

And I'm the guy with the story.

</line>


<line>
And I need you to be Amelie right now.

</line>


<line>
I don't like foreign movies.

I like foreign <ital>films.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're impossible.

</line>


<line>
The rest of you, please,

just listen for a second.

</line>


<line>
I know you hate me.

But for Hollyhock, please, listen.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whole time she's staying with me,

it doesn't make sense, right?

</line>


<line>
If I'm her father,

where is her mother?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's an extremely

heteronormative way

</line>


<line>
-of looking at things.

-No, I'm saying, medically,

where is the woman I had sex with

that made her be born?

</line>


<line>
Right? That's why Hollyhock

came to L.A. in the first place.

</line>


<line>
Okay...

</line>


<line>
But then I thought,

"What if I'm not her father?"

</line>


<line>
You're not her father.

<ital>We </ital>are her fathers.

</line>


<line>
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

</line>


<line>
Eight of you, each have

your own cute thing, I get it.

</line>


<line>
My point is, Hollyhock and I

have the same DNA,

but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

</line>


<line>
You're not.

Because being a father isn't just--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, I feel like you are

willfully misunderstanding me.

</line>


<line>
What I am saying is,

I'm not even her father biologically.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me?

-My father is her father.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I went to every hospital</ital>

<ital>and clerk house in L.A.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I waited in lines, filled out forms,</ital>

<ital>talked to anyone who would talk to me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I wouldn't rest until I knew</ital>

<ital>I'd done everything I could.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But there was no record</ital>

<ital>of a little horse girl</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>born on Hollyhock's birthday...</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so?

</line>


<line>
...in L.A., because Hollyhock

wasn't born in L.A.

</line>


<line>
She was born in <name type="GPE">San Francisco</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I got a little bug in my brain</ital>

<ital>that my father knocked up the help.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So I went up there, and I did</ital>

<ital>the whole thing again, and I found it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The birth certificate</ital>

<ital>with her mother's name,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>clear as day, <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name> Platchkey.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-That's--

-But where is she now, right?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Looked her up on <name type="ORG">Facebook</name>.</ital>

<ital>I know what you think:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name></ital>

<ital>has a <name type="ORG">Facebook</name> account?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Obviously, I didn't,</ital>

<ital>because the Internet is for nerds.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But I know it's a good way to find people,</ital>

<ital>so I set up an account, and I found her.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She lives in <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>.</ital>

<ital>She's a nurse.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Her phone number</ital>

<ital>was on her <name type="ORG">Facebook</name> page.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.

</line>


<line>
-You did all that?

-She has to know.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to tell her I was here.

I'll stay out of her life forever.

</line>


<line>
You can tell her I'm an asshole.

Say you found this on your own.

</line>


<line>
I don't care, but you have

to tell her. Please.

</line>


<line>
-All right, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. We'll tell her.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But you need to leave.

Right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Okay.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to the best

workout routine in L.A.

</line>


<line>
Nothing motivates like fear.

</line>


<line>
So remember, once you're in there,

don't stop running.

</line>


<line>
If the clown dentists catch you,

they will bite you,

and they have very healthy teeth.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Okay, but not really, right?

</line>


<line>
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,

and they do actually have rabies.

</line>


<line>
Wow, guess I'm gonna

really have to run.

</line>


<line>
No more excuses. This is great.

</line>


<line>
Exactly! And don't forget...

have fun in there!

</line>


<line>
-[woman] Whoo-hoo!

-[man] Let's do this.

</line>


<line>
-[man 2] Let's go.

-[all screaming]

</line>


<line>
Well, you did it.

You made a better business.

</line>


<line>
<ital>We </ital>did it.

</line>


<line>
Between your no-nonsense approach

and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense

approach,

we make a pretty good team.

</line>


<line>
Yes. I'm going back to my job.

</line>


<line>
But if anything happens here

and you need me,

or if you just wanna hang out again,

grab a drink,

you should call me sometime.

</line>


<line>
Oh, um, I should tell you,

I'm actually asexual.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know. So am I.

That's why I'm asking you out.

</line>


<line>
-Oh! Uh, okay.

-Okay. Goodbye.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell chimes, whinnies]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I have to talk to you.

-Make yourself at home.

</line>


<line>
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I promised you'd do this show.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why. I just...

I needed something--

</line>


<line>
-I'll do it.

-What?

</line>


<line>
You want me to do it, I'll do it.

<name type="PERSON">God</name> knows you've done enough for me.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

</line>


<line>
It's just really hard to need people.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but...

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Eh, it'll be good for me

to get out of the house anyway.

</line>


<line>
You want a drink?

</line>


<line>
-Water.

-Water? "Water" you pregnant?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Very much not so.

</line>


<line>
-I heard you got a new boyfriend.

-We broke up.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

</line>


<line>
He was actually the first guy I ever dated

who wasn't an asshole.

</line>


<line>
-Well, onwards and upwards.

-I heard you had a kid living with you?

</line>


<line>
No. She's got these adopted dads.

</line>


<line>
They're total dicks,

but they take care of her.

</line>


<line>
-She'll have a good life.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-You ever think of adopting?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-More and more lately.

-You should. You'd be a good mom.

</line>


<line>
-The world needs good moms.

-I'll take that under advisement.

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

</line>


<line>
I'm looking forward to it.

</line>


<line>
Now, back to normal.

Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
-Here we are. The rest of our lives.

-I wanna show you something.

</line>


<line>
I had the contractor put this together

while we were gone. Close your eyes.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Okay...

-All right. Open them.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>! It's--

-Pretty cool, huh?

</line>


<line>
-Why would you do this?

-It's what you always wanted, right?

</line>


<line>
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

</line>


<line>
-Like what?

-I don't know. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
This is great. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Why would you think I would like this?

</line>


<line>
Because you told me

this is what you always dreamed of?

</line>


<line>
I don't like big gestures like this!

</line>


<line>
-How many times have I--?

-Yeah, but this is--

</line>


<line>
This was a fantasy,

something that belonged to me.

</line>


<line>
Why couldn't you have asked me--

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try

to surprise you, or do nice things.

</line>


<line>
Do you know how much it cost

to get 5,000 fake books?

</line>


<line>
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--

-I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home

feel like a place

that you would want to live

that could be yours as well as mine!

</line>


<line>
Why is that so important to you?

</line>


<line>
Because otherwise,

it feels like you're a guest.

</line>


<line>
And unlike the talking candlestick

in the aforementioned <name type="ORG">Disney</name> film,

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be that.

</line>


<line>
It makes me feel shitty.

</line>


<line>
Like you're just visiting here,

until the next thing

and you're gonna leave me

when you get bored

or you find something better.

</line>


<line>
Like <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name> did. Like <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> did.

</line>


<line>
You can't use your ex-wives against me.

</line>


<line>
I'm just telling you how I feel.

</line>


<line>
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

</line>


<line>
This is not how I thought

this would go at all.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Peanutbutter.

Back to normal, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know, sometimes I feel like

our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

</line>


<line>
-I love those things.

-I know.

</line>


<line>
And it's messy. And at first glance,

it doesn't seem to make any sense.

</line>


<line>
And it's hard to figure out.

</line>


<line>
But sometimes,

if you squint at it just right,

everything lines up,

and it's the most perfect...

beautiful, amazing thing.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know what you mean.

</line>


<line>
But...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[voice breaks]</nonVerbComm> I'm so tired of squinting.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crying]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, Christ.

-[ringtone chiming]

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock.

-Hi.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-How are you?</ital>

-Listen...

</line>


<line>
I wanted to thank you

for finding my mom.

</line>


<line>
-They told you?

-Not exactly.

</line>


<line>
They have this secret dad language

they think I don't understand,

but it's super obvious

what they're saying.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> You're too smart

for your own good.

</line>


<line>
So, yeah, I've been talking

to <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name> on the phone

and she seems really nice.

</line>


<line>
Really? Wow!

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna visit her in <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>.

I'm at the airport right now.

</line>


<line>
Right now? That's incredible.

</line>


<line>
No, what's incredible

is this place at the airport

charged me ten dollars

for a cup of fruit.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-What?</ital>

-And get this.

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's like 90 percent honeydew.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding me? Why?

</line>


<line>
What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding

more honeydew in his or her fruit cup?

</line>


<line>
Nobody ever wants honeydew,

it's always there.

</line>


<line>
It is literally the worst part

of everything it's in.

</line>


<line>
It's like the <name type="PERSON">Jared Leto</name> of fruits.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. Exactly.

</line>


<line>
Mmm.

</line>


<line>
Well...

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

they're about to start boarding, so...

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock, I'm sorry

I didn't take better care of you.

</line>


<line>
I shouldn't have moved in with you.

It was maybe too much too fast.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

<ital>-But it wasn't all bad.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I mean, yeah,

I got secretly drugged for months on end

to the point I was living a nightmare

in which I couldn't recognize my own body

or understand what was happening

to my brain, but,

other than that,

it was a pretty chill experience.

</line>


<line>
I should have protected you.

</line>


<line>
I really wanted to be

a good dad to you, Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Good thing.

</line>


<line>
So, uh, <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>, huh?

Did you rent a car or a cab?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, it's all taken care of.

I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

</line>


<line>
I can upgrade your seats, or...

or send you better fruit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, look,

I never needed you to be a dad.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to be fine.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I told you from the beginning,</ital>

<ital>I have eight dads.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

</line>


<line>
But... I've never had a brother.
