<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>I got into</ital>

<ital>this business because I love stories.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey comfort us, they inspire us,

they create a context

for <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w we experience the world.

</line>


<line>
But also, you have to be careful,

because if you spend

a lot of time with stories,

you start to believe that life

is just stories, and it's not.

</line>


<line>
Life is life, and that's so sad,

because there's so little time and...

what are we doing with it?

</line>


<line>
-[clocks ticking]

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
When Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn told me

we were pitching

to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

</line>


<line>
I was excited,

because in so many ways,

the story I'm about to tell is about time.

</line>


<line>
And it's about time this story was told.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh!

-Ahh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>It's about Detective <name type="PERSON">John</name> <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>,</ital>

<ital>a man from another time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>But now he finds himself</ital>

<ital>in a new time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, did you say newt time?

-No, no, new time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
Unless you want it to be

a time full of newts.

</line>


<line>
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
He finds himself in a time

he doesn't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne dialing]

</line>


<line>
-[man] <ital>Don't call this number a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.</ital>

-Wait. I-- I just--

</line>


<line>
My mother, she's senile,

and she was drugging the coffee.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why-- Just--

</line>


<line>
I wanted you to know that

none of this was <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck's fault.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[man]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital><name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>A time in which he is alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Perhaps, all this time,</ital>

<ital>he's been alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Except for the newts, right?

-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Except for the newts.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
And then it dawns on him,

his partner isn't a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st.

</line>


<line>
Or is he?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>!

-As we like to say here,

</line>


<line>
there are little hand ideas

and big hand ideas.

</line>


<line>
And that's a big hand idea.

</line>


<line>
And you said <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

is attached?

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, yeah.

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is attached.

</line>


<line>
But he's not like "attached" attached.

</line>


<line>
If you want us

to get somebody better--

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no, no.

We love <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. We don't wanna do this

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, just to be clear.

</line>


<line>
-Well--

-Oh, he's definitely attached.

</line>


<line>
He signed a contract. I saw it myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

[gulps]

</line>


<line>
So if you look to the left, you'll see

a charming little breakfast nook.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps] <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at that!

</line>


<line>
But if you want more natural light,

</line>


<line>
you could knock down that wall

and put in these...

</line>


<line>
<name type="NORP">-<name type="NORP">French</name></name> doors!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is so cool!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u actually don't have to yell.

-Wait, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Are we in the same <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use right now?

I don't see you.

</line>


<line>
I can hear you.

I think we're close!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't see each other

in the program.

</line>


<line>
So I'm invisible?

Oh, in this scenario, am I a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st?

</line>


<line>
Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

</line>


<line>
w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cannot rest <name type="ORG">un</name>til

his final letter is delivered!

</line>


<line>
And can I be

<name type="PERSON">Anne</name> of Green Gables?

</line>


<line>
No, you're both still you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, can I talk to you alone

for a moment?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I can step out--

-Sure!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you meet me

in the guest bathroom? Ow!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to.

-Where's--

</line>


<line>
-Hold on. I think--

-<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s, I can just--

</line>


<line>
-Here we are.

<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>?

</line>


<line>
No. Careful. Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Do you really love this <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

-Yeah, it's fine.

</line>


<line>
I didn't love the old <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

but it was your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use and I moved in,

and it was great.

</line>


<line>
But this is an opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity

to build something together.

</line>


<line>
Something that'll last

for the rest of our lives.

</line>


<line>
Anything you want is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be good

with me. Just like your old <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
But I don't want this to just be

another one of <ital>my</ital> <name type="PERSON">ho</name>uses.

</line>


<line>
I want this to be <ital>our</ital> <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
And it will be,

because we'll both be living in it.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

I don't need anything fancy.

</line>


<line>
All that matters to me

is that I get to live with you.

</line>


<line>
-In the real world.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
No more campaign,

no more ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
Just <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

back to normal.

</line>


<line>
-For the rest of our lives.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great.

</line>


<line>
-We'll take it.

-One <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh,

</line>


<line>
-I have to use the bathroom.

-No, no, no, that's not--

</line>

Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

</line>


<line>
I've still got a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of her stuff.

</line>


<line>
Don't put me on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld.

Just take a message--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Wait, wait!</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a DNA expert?</ital>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Scheck]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Well, sometimes,</ital>

<ital>DNA can be a tricky thing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Like, for example,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>was <name type="PERSON">Simpson</name> DNA fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d at the scene</ital>

<ital>of the murder of <name type="PERSON">Nicole</name> <name type="PERSON">Brown</name>?</ital>

<ital>Sure. Was it O.J. <name type="PERSON">Simpson</name>'s DNA?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s to say?</ital>

<ital>-Oh.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it was some other <name type="PERSON">Simpson</name>,</ital>

<ital>like his son, or his father.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no way to know.</ital>

<ital>I wouldn't worry about it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[doorbell chimes]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Hey, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Uh-oh.

-She had a long day... of drinking.

</line>


<line>
I figured she s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't

drive herself <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d thinking.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I was right too,

because she crashed her car.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I probably s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld've

said something, but...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get your shit together.

</line>


<line>
Wha-- Where am I?

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you're always

giving pep talks to people,

telling them they need

to get their shit together?

</line>


<line>
Well, this is me giving you

the Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn pep talk.

</line>


<line>
-Why am I tied up in the woods?

-So you can't escape my wise words.

</line>


<line>
Is that not part of it?

I couldn't remember.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter.

It's all over for me.

</line>


<line>
When it gets out

I faked <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s signature,

the deal's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> fall apart.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here goes my reputation, my career--

</line>


<line>
Well, there's more to life

than just your career, isn't there?

</line>


<line>
-Is there?

-Isn't there?

</line>


<line>
I have nothing!

</line>


<line>
Oh! <name type="PERSON">T</name>his pep talk is going

in the wrong direction.

</line>


<line>
Do you know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard it is

to start a family at my age?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>o find a guy at my age?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't need a guy to start a family.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can do anything.

</line>


<line>
No, I can't.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, the woods are dark and scary,

but the only way out is through.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

I got distracted by the woods.

</line>


<line>
-Um, what were we talking about?

-No, you're right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only way out is through.

</line>


<line>
I gotta talk to <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

</line>


<line>
I'm Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the spirit!

</line>


<line>
As my blood type always says,

"B" positive!

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor <name type="PERSON">Picarello</name>.

-[groaning]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor <name type="PERSON">Picarello</name>, are you okay?

</line>


<line>
-[growling]

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd</name>?

</line>


<line>
-[all snarling]

-[drill whirring]

</line>


<line>
So it turns out Vice Chancellor

<name type="PERSON">Laughing Gassy</name> got rabies

from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

</line>


<line>
And then he started biting everyone,

and now a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of them have rabies.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> could have predicted

my innocent clown dentist venture

</line>


<line>
-could turn into something so terrifying?

-I don't see <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w this concerns me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>landa, the only reason

they're in the woods at all

is because of you.

</line>


<line>
If people find out the Better

Business Bureau is behind this,

you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

from the Business Branch

of the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ard of Better Bureaus?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right! We have to do something

before someone gets hurt.

</line>


<line>
Call me four out of five dentists,

because I agree.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Here we are.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he rest of our lives.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, wow.

</line>


<line>
-Do you wanna go to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>?

-What? Right now?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! When's the last time

we did something impulsive?

</line>


<line>
Well, you did r<name type="ORG">un</name> for governor

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut giving it much--

</line>


<line>
I just think we could use a vacation.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hings have been so crazy this last year.

</line>


<line>
Before we start the rest of our lives,

haven't we earned a break?

</line>


<line>
All right. Let's go to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey got

that bridge that's just sitting there.

</line>


<line>
-We might as well use it.

-All right! <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>, here we come!

</line>


<line>
-All right! <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>!

-<name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rns <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nking]

-[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter sighs]

-[gulls squawking]

</line>


<line>
So, listen.

</line>


<line>
As you know, one of the differences

between agents and managers--

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Stop. Please stop.

-I'm producing a new <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
It's a phenomenal script which may

or may not involve g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st or newts.

</line>


<line>
-Does it involve g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st or newts?

-It may!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u haven't read it, have you?

-Read it? I'm producing it!

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

</line>


<line>
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.

-Right, well--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're impossible to figure out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen all of a sudden, some random detail

makes the hero remember a conversation

that totally re-contextualizes everything,

and then it all magically comes together.

</line>


<line>
-Sure, but--

-It's such bullshit.

</line>


<line>
Where's my random detail that's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

suddenly make everything make sense?

</line>


<line>
Because I would love that.

</line>


<line>
Well, this script is really special,

and everyone wants to play the lead,

from <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tthew McConaughey

to <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tthew Perry.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tthew Perry?

-Yeah. But I was thinking--

</line>


<line>
Hold on. <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tthew Perry...

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, which one

of these pictures more says,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>his daughter looks like a cool lady

that I wanna have in my life"?

</line>


<line>
Why do you ask?

</line>


<line>
I'm writing a letter to my mom

and I want to include a picture.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to send it

to the adoption agency.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe if they still have her address

on file, they can forward it to her.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a long s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t. How about

a better strategy is, don't do that,

and then you won't be disappointed

when it doesn't work out?

</line>


<line>
I'm trying everything.

I don't wanna look back at this

and feel like the end

of "<name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>'s List," you know?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean <ital><name type="PERSON">Schindler</name>'s List</ital>.

-Never saw it.

</line>


<line>
I'm talking about "<name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>'s List,"

the sketch from when <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tthew Perry

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>sted <ital>SNL.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Remind me?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
So it's <name type="PERSON">Chandler</name> from <ital>Friends,</ital>

and it's World War II,

and he's got this list.

</line>


<line>
And the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time, he's like,

"I'm <name type="PERSON">Chandler</name>!

</line>


<line>
Could I <ital>have</ital> a bigger list?"

</line>


<line>
But then at the end, the war's over,

and he's like...

</line>


<line>
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a.

</line>


<line>
He's ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted because he feels

like he could have done more.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, he's like,

</line>


<line>
"Could I <ital>be</ital> any more feeling

like I could have done more?"

</line>


<line>
I have to go.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I'm trying to do you a favor here!

-Me neither.

-I gotta get in better shape.

I keep saying I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> r<name type="ORG">un</name> more,

but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

</line>

Don't "h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>." I'm talking to you.

</line>


<line>
-Can you not start and stop so much?

-I can't control the traffic, darling.

</line>


<line>
When the car in front of me starts,

I start. And when it stops, I stop.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you don't have to start

every time the car in front of you starts,

because you know it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

stop a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in anyway.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u could leave a little space.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-[engine rumbles]

-And another car just cut in front of me

because I left a little space.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get some <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s.

</line>


<line>
All right. I got the lowdown.

</line>


<line>
First of all, very important,

I got you this flattened penny.

</line>


<line>
I will cherish it always.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.

-Don't worry about it.

</line>


<line>
Here's the deal.

</line>


<line>
With this traffic,

we can stay on our current trajectory

and get to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name> just in time

to spend two luxurious <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs

at the Honolulu <name type="PERSON">Stilton</name>,

and then turn aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d and come back,

or we can hang out here

at the <name type="PERSON">T</name>hrifty <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>dge

at this charming halfway to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>

rest area and <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s park.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

we would like your finest room, please.

</line>


<line>
-All our rooms are the same.

-What kind of cuisine is on premises?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's a deli at the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s station

across the street.

</line>


<line>
-And what are your spa <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no spa.

</line>


<line>
Okay, if I wanted to have a big <name type="PERSON">ga</name>la,

could I use your grand ballroom for that,

or is that booked months in advance?

</line>


<line>
I could settle for a <name type="NORP">dem</name>i-ballroom

in a pinch,

but attire will be formal,

I don't wanna upstage the venue.

</line>


<line>
We have zero ballrooms

in this <name type="PERSON">T</name>hrifty <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>dge.

</line>


<line>
I see. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his will do nicely.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>dn't you tell me once

you always wanted a ballroom?

</line>


<line>
Actually, no. [chuckles]

What I wanted was a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room.

</line>


<line>
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

</line>


<line>
It's a room full of big books,

with big windows and a ladder,

like <name type="ORG">Belle</name> got in <ital><name type="PERSON">Bea</name>uty and the <name type="PERSON">Bea</name>st.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-And it's called a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room?

-It's called a library.

</line>


<line>
But I called it a <name type="ORG">Belle</name>-room

because it was magical.

</line>


<line>
And since it was a name I made up

for a room that wasn't real,

that meant that it was just mine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's adora-<name type="ORG">Belle</name>.

<name type="PERSON">-[woman</name>] Hey, <name type="ORG">Seaborn</name>! <name type="ORG">Seaborn</name>!

</line>


<line>
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's like a shellfish version

<line>
It'll make their day.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't mind?

-I'll be in the room.

</line>


<line>
Don't stay out

with your new friends too late.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.

What other of my things do you like?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[man]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Wow, yeah!

"I really oughta give <name type="GPE">Iowa</name> a try."

-Hey!

-I need to talk to <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck!

</line>


<line>
-She's not here.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have to let me see her.

</line>


<line>
Please, I flew all the way here

and it's <name type="GPE">Wichita</name>,

so it's not like

I got other shit to do in <name type="GPE">Wichita</name>.

</line>


<line>
No one told you to come here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> likes foreign movies, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat part in <ital><name type="GPE">Amelie</name>,</ital>

where she listens to the guy's story?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is that part.

And I'm the guy with the story.

</line>


<line>
And I need you to be <name type="GPE">Amelie</name> right now.

</line>


<line>
I don't like foreign movies.

I like foreign <ital>films.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're impossible.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he rest of you, please,

just listen for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond.

</line>


<line>
I know you hate me.

But for <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck, please, listen.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clears throat]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time she's staying with me,

it doesn't make sense, right?

</line>


<line>
If I'm her father,

where is her mother?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's an extremely

heteronormative way

</line>


<line>
-of looking at things.

-No, I'm saying, medically,

where is the woman I had sex with

that made her be born?

</line>


<line>
Right? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck

came to L.A. in the first place.

</line>


<line>
Okay...

</line>


<line>
But then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

"What if I'm not her father?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not her father.

<ital>We </ital>are her fathers.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

</line>


<line>
Eight of you, each have

your own cute thing, I get it.

</line>


<line>
My point is, <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck and I

have the same DNA,

but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not.

Because being a father isn't just--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, I feel like you are

willfully mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstanding me.

</line>


<line>
What I am saying is,

I'm not even her father biologically.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me?

-My father is her father.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>I went to every <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital</ital>

<ital>and clerk <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use in L.A.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I waited in lines, filled out forms,</ital>

<ital>talked to anyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> would talk to me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I wouldn't rest <name type="ORG">un</name>til I knew</ital>

<ital>I'd done everything I could.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But there was no record</ital>

<ital>of a little <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse girl</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>born on <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck's birthday...</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so?

</line>


<line>
...in L.A., because <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck

wasn't born in L.A.

</line>


<line>
She was born in <name type="GPE">San Francisco</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I got a little bug in my brain</ital>

<ital>that my father knocked up the help.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So I went up there, and I did</ital>

<ital>the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, and I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d it.</ital>

</line>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oked her up on <name type="ORG">Facebook</name>.</ital>

<ital>Obviously, I didn't,</ital>

<ital>because the Internet is for nerds.</ital>

-She has to know.

</line>

<line>
I don't know why. I just...

I needed something--

</line>


<line>
-I'll do it.

-What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want me to do it, I'll do it.

<name type="PERSON">God</name> knows you've done enough for me.

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wasn't an ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le.

</line>


<line>
-Well, onwards and upwards.

-I heard you had a kid living with you?

</line>


<line>
No. She's got these adopted dads.

but they take care of her.

-She'll have a good life.

-Here we are. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he rest of our lives.

-I wanna s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you something.

<line>
I had the contractor put this together

while we were gone. Close your eyes.

<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Okay...

-All right. Open them.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>! It's--

-Pretty cool, huh?

</line>


<line>
-Why would you do this?

-It's what you always wanted, right?

</line>


<line>
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

</line>


<line>
-Like what?

-I don't know. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is great. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Why would you think I would like this?

</line>


<line>
Because you told me

this is what you always dreamed of?

</line>


<line>
I don't like big gestures like this!

</line>


<line>
-How many times have I--?

-Yeah, but this is--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his was a fantasy,

something that belonged to me.

</line>


<line>
Why couldn't you have asked me--

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try

to surprise you, or do nice things.

</line>


<line>
Do you know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much it cost

to get 5,000 fake books?

</line>


<line>
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--

-I'm sorry that I wanted to make our <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

feel like a place

that you would want to live

that could be yours as well as mine!

</line>


<line>
Why is that so important to you?

</line>


<line>
Because otherwise,

it feels like you're a guest.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">un</name>like the talking candlestick

in the aforementioned <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sney film,

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be that.

</line>


<line>
It makes me feel shitty.

</line>


<line>
Like you're just visiting here,

<name type="ORG">un</name>til the next thing

and you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> leave me

when you get bored

or you find something better.

</line>


<line>
Like <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name> did. Like <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> did.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't use your ex-wives a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst me.

</line>


<line>
I'm just telling you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I feel.

</line>


<line>
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

this would go at all.

our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

</line>


<line>
-I love t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se things.

-I know.

</line>


<line>
And it's messy. And at first glance,

it doesn't seem to make any sense.

</line>


<line>
And it's hard to figure out.

</line>


<line>
But sometimes,

if you squint at it just right,

everything lines up,

and it's the most perfect...

beautiful, amazing thing.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know what you mean.

</line>


<line>
But...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[voice breaks]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I'm so tired of squinting.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[crying]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, Christ.

-[ringtone chiming]

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-How are you?</ital>

-Listen...

</line>


<line>
I wanted to thank you

for finding my mom.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey told you?

-Not exactly.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey have this <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret dad language

they think I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand,

but it's super obvious

what they're saying.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're too smart

for your own good.

</line>


<line>
So, yeah, I've been talking

to <name type="GPE">Henrietta</name> on the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne

and she seems really nice.

</line>


<line>
Really? Wow!

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> visit her in <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>.

I'm at the airport right now.

</line>


<line>
Right now? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's incredible.

</line>


<line>
No, what's incredible

is this place at the airport

charged me ten dollars

for a cup of fruit.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-What?</ital>

-And get this.

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's like 90 percent <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding me? Why?

</line>


<line>
What on-the-go jet-setter's <name type="NORP">dem</name>anding

more <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew in his or her fruit cup?

</line>


<line>
Nobody ever wants <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew,

it's always there.

</line>


<line>
It is literally the worst part

of everything it's in.

</line>


<line>
It's like the <name type="PERSON">Jared Leto</name> of fruits.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you. Exactly.

</line>


<line>
M<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well...

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

they're about to start boarding, so...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck, I'm sorry

I didn't take better care of you.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't have moved in with you.

It was maybe too much too fast.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

<ital>-But it wasn't all bad.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I mean, yeah,

I got <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly drugged for months on end

to the point I was living a nightmare

in which I couldn't recognize my own body

or <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand what was happening

to my brain, but,

other than that,

it was a pretty <name type="PERSON">chill</name> experience.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have protected you.

</line>


<line>
I really wanted to be

a good dad to you, <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

</line>


<line>
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d thing, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d thing.

</line>


<line>
So, uh, <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>, huh?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you rent a car or a cab?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, it's all taken care of.

I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

</line>


<line>
I can upgrade your seats, or...

or send you better fruit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, look,

I never needed you to be a dad.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to be fine.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I told you from the beginning,</ital>

<ital>I have eight dads.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d.

</line>


<line>
But... I've never had a brother.
