</line>


<line>
And that's the end of a sexist,

fatphobic anecdote

in which I was so desperate

to get out of the rain,

</line>


<line>
-I slept with a plus-sized woman.

-[laughter continues]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> Hold the door.

</line>


<line>
-Oh! Did I miss a meeting?

-No, <name type="PERSON">Angela</name>.

</line>


<line>
We took <name type="PERSON">Davey</name> here out

for a big '90s-style birthday party,

it being the '90s and all...

</line>


<line>
I would have come!

I love the '90s, and it being them.

</line>


<line>
Come on, the president of the network

shouldn't fraternize with the board.

</line>


<line>
Let your number two handle that stuff.

</line>


<line>
-[elevator dings]

-[laughter continues]

</line>


<line>
I don't like you going to birthday parties

behind my back, Teddy.

</line>


<line>
I was doing reconnaissance for you!

</line>


<line>
You didn't hear it from me,

but there's some concern

that as a single career gal, you're,

</line>


<line>
-well, a single career gal.

-And?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">ABC</name>'s supposed to be

a family network.

</line>


<line>
I understand families.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Does he?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>. [sighs]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry, okay?

</line>


<line>
It's called discretion, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
We're trying to sell

the network to <name type="ORG">Disney</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Disney</name>? You think Michael <name type="ORG">Eisner</name>

gives a hoot w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I go to bed with?

</line>


<line>
We don't need to bring <name type="ORG">Eisner</name> into this.

</line>


<line>
Obviously,

Michael <name type="ORG">Eisner</name> is a compassionate

and progressive individual.

</line>


<line>
This isn't about him.

</line>


<line>
-So, it's you. Just say it's you.

-No. You're the one--

</line>


<line>
If you're going to fire me,

at least have the balls to fire me.

</line>


<line>
-You're fired.

-Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
You think you can do

"<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around" without me?

</line>


<line>
We could do it without anybody.

All we need is the horse.

</line>


<line>
And that horse is just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go along

with you canning his best friend?

</line>


<line>
You want <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> to betray me,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> need one hell of a pitch.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>

-[inhales, sighs]

-[knocking on door]

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>, you're invited to set?

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-The set of "Horny Unicorn"?

-Yes, I'm aware.

</line>


<line>
To shoot a scene

in which the titular horny unicorn

gets his penis stuck in a saxophone,

because he was hoping to "get blown"?

</line>


<line>
I know the scene, thank you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps, gulps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ah.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone rings, beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, this is <name type="PERSON">Angela</name> Diaz.</ital>

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
<ital>We met once before.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I remember.

</line>


<line>
I saw your interview several months back.

It made me nostalgic.

</line>


<line>
Me too. Nostalgic for the day

before I did the interview.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, humor. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
If you're free tonight, you could come by

the house, watch the fire, reminisce.

</line>


<line>
There's something

I've been meaning to ask you.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<ital>Wouldn't you love to find out?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
So, the <name type="PERSON">Stephen King</name> musical opened

right next door to the Sondheim revival.

</line>


<line>
We have clients in both.

 I was worried there'd be tension,

</line>


<line>
but it turns out <ital>Misery loves Company.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>, are you in a band?

</line>


<line>
Why do you ask that?

</line>


<line>
I've always wondered if you were in a band

ever since this afternoon

</line>


<line>
when I overheard <name type="PERSON">Juniper</name> tell <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>

that you were in a band.

</line>


<line>
You're playing a gig tonight,

and the whole office is going.

</line>


<line>
I was planning to invite you,

but didn't want you to feel obligated.

</line>


<line>
-We're not good.

-[phone ringing]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lenny</name>! How the shell are you?

</line>


<line>
I got trouble, PC!

</line>


<line>
You know Teddy Buttons,

my head of production?

</line>


<line>
I'm familiar with Teddy.

</line>


<line>
I somehow missed that Teddy has spent

the last 20 years showing women his...

</line>


<line>
I'm familiar.

</line>


<line>
See, that's why I love you.

You're discreet.

</line>


<line>
-You're tough. You're Teflon.

-That's me, an old frying pan.

</line>


<line>
I could use someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can

handle the heat over here.

</line>


<line>
Someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can be more

professional and less... <name type="PERSON">Moonves</name>.

</line>


<line>
What are you saying?

</line>


<line>
I want you to r<name type="ORG">un</name> Turteltaub's

new female-focused studio division,

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Girtletaub</name>!

-I didn't sneeze.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Girtletaub</name> is the studio.

</line>


<line>
I wanna announce a slate

before the Teddy story hits the trades.

</line>


<line>
You think you can throw one together?

</line>


<line>
You want me to pitch

my dream movie studio?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I need it tomorrow morning. We gotta hit</ital>

<ital>the ground running with this thing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> You don't wanna

go slow and steady?

</line>


<line>
-What am I, a tortoise?

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Get me box office numbers.

</line>


<line>
We need firm financial figures to frame

how fans flock

to flicks that flex chicks,

woman films,

like <ital>Pretty, Wonder, Little.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Diary of a Mad Black.</ital>

I'll get my laptop.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait! Your gig.

</line>


<line>
I have time. This is important.

<ital>When a Man Loves a...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-That's another film title,

as we were discussing previously.

</line>


<line>
Oh, of course.

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone rings, beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>, I'm about to...

<ital>-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Am I wearing a <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt right now that says

"Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"?

</line>


<line>
I can't see you right now,

but I'm guessing by your tone, no?

</line>


<line>
Then why is my ex-wife treating me

like I'm some kind of asshole?

</line>


<line>
Did you tell her

you weren't wearing the shirt?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lady</name> got a job in <name type="GPE">Houston</name>.

</line>


<line>
She's taking Sonny out of school

and moving to Texas.

</line>


<line>
She can't do that!

</line>


<line>
Well, she can,

because she has full custody.

</line>


<line>
And this is her dream job, and I'm really

happy for her. But this sucks!

</line>


<line>
Well, they must need cameramen

in <name type="GPE">Houston</name>, and I can write anywhere...

</line>


<line>
I... couldn't ask you to do that.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't ask you to ask.

</line>


<line>
If Sonny's going to <name type="GPE">Houston</name>,

then we're going.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Okay. All right. <name type="GPE">Houston</name>.

Uh, g-go, Astros!

</line>


<line>
Go... rodeos!

</line>


<line>
Hope you like barbecue!

</line>


<line>
I hope I don't need another abortion

because they are hard to get there!

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what?

-Just trying to think of Texas things.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. <name type="GPE">Houston</name>!

</line>


<line>
All day at the airport,

I watch people pull suitcases.

</line>


<line>
Why do we suffer

that extra weight dragging us down?

</line>


<line>
Because we need clean clothes.

</line>


<line>
The point is: helium luggage.

</line>


<line>
Why pack light

when you can pack lighter than air?

</line>


<line>
All right, so Mom's too sick

to come out of her room

but not too sick

to make her famous Frito pie?

</line>


<line>
Well, she wanted to see you.

</line>


<line>
She was fine all day

and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.

</line>


<line>
I wanna see her.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, no, she's not there!

She's at the <name type="LOC">Zumba</name>.

</line>


<line>
Is she at <name type="LOC">Zumba</name> or is she sick?

</line>


<line>
She is sick but was hoping

the <name type="NORP">Afro-<name type="NORP">Latin</name></name> fusion beats

</line>


<line>
-would make her feel better.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
This was a mistake.

</line>


<line>
-[car alarm chirps]

-[Todd] Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Todd, I must confess to you,

your mother is not at <name type="LOC">Zumba</name>.

</line>


<line>
I can see her in the window.

</line>


<line>
Oh! That's a mannequin

so I can test out my outfits.

</line>


<line>
-You're lying again!

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Okay. She didn't come to dinner

because she's ashamed.

</line>


<line>
She can't say hello?

The woman has my kidney!

</line>


<line>
And that's why she's ashamed.

</line>


<line>
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.

</line>


<line>
If she could turn it around somehow,

save your life...

</line>


<line>
-But, alas, she cannot.

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
But maybe if she could...

but no, you’re obviously healthy.

</line>


<line>
-But if you weren't...

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
-But you are.

-Hmm.

</line>


<line>
-Clearly there is nothing to be done.

-Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm> Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales, sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Angela</name>] <ital>Hey.</ital>

-Wha--

</line>


<line>
<ital>Aren't you the horse</ital>

<ital>from "<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around"?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Mm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Look at this thing.

I fell down one time and I'm an invalid.

</line>


<line>
-Word to the wise, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, don't get old.

-I'll see what I can do about that.

</line>


<line>
My 40-year-old companion

treats me like a fragile antique.

</line>


<line>
I've got a Lamborghini Miura

and she won't even let me drive it.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry to hear that.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry that at the '94 upfronts

we made you do that stupid <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> dance.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Is that why you wanted

to see me tonight?

</line>


<line>
No. You're tall.

I need you to reach a box.

</line>


<line>
"Melanie, good luck with your braces.

I think they look cool."

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

<ital>-<music>♪ W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s that dog? ♪</music></ital>

<ital>-<music>♪ Mr. Peanutbutter! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>!

-You wrote a memoir?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago,

then one weekend it just fell out of me.

</line>


<line>
-What?

<ital>-From the way people talk about writing,</ital>

</line>


<line>
I always assumed it was very difficult,

but it turns out it's not at all,

literally anyone can do it!

</line>


<line>
Yes, that's always been my experience.

</line>


<line>
I loved your new book, by the way.

</line>


<line>
-Thanks.

<ital>-I'm happy for you, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Even though it's really easy

to write a book,

it's still an accomplishment

to be proud of.

</line>


<line>
-I am.

<ital>-And how's <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you a Chicagoan yet?

You know, I went to school in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

</line>


<line>
You went to <name type="LOC">Northwestern</name>.

That's not in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ah! You <ital>are</ital> a Chicagoan!

</line>


<line>
I'm actually about to move to <name type="GPE">Houston</name>.

</line>


<line>
In <name type="GPE">New York</name>? Oh, I think there

they pronounce it "Hose-town."

</line>


<line>
No, Texas. My boyfriend and I are going.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow! Boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-That's fantastic.

</line>


<line>
I wanna hear all about him.

I assume he's a good guy?

</line>


<line>
He's actually the best <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>.

</line>


<line>
His girlfriend looks nice.

He seems healthy.

</line>


<line>
What-- What's his job?

</line>


<line>
I think he runs a daycare,

but he talks about the babies

as if they're his co-workers,

so it's impossible to know for sure.

</line>


<line>
-I should have been there.

-We'll try again.

</line>


<line>
-[phone rings]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

<name type="PERSON">-[woman</name>] <ital>Listen up, Helen.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I've kidnapped your son</ital>

<ital>and I demand a ransom or I will--</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[whispers] Next card?

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
"Murder him!"

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! Todd's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get murdered

by a fearsome stranger

whose sage, buttery voice simultaneously

comforts me and fills me with dread.

</line>


<line>
Sounds like a lot of range

for a kidnapper.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are you and what do you want?

</line>


<line>
"I'm your worst nightmare and I want

one hundred of your famous <name type="ORG">Frito pies</name>."

</line>


<line>
Yes. Anything!

</line>


<line>
"Under the Hyperion Street Bridge

in one hour."

</line>


<line>
That was perfect! Thank you, Margo!

</line>


<line>
It's the least I can do.

</line>


<line>
Getting you to buy

that addictive video game

was the act that set me down

this ruinous path so many years ago.

</line>


<line>
If I can make things right by you,

maybe there's hope yet

for this wretched soul.

</line>


<line>
Okay!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Open it.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa.

-The studio went all-out.

</line>


<line>
They even found your original screen test.

</line>


<line>
That's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Too bad no one will ever see it.

</line>


<line>
After your interview,

we couldn't give these things away.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. Sure.

</line>


<line>
It was a great show.

</line>


<line>
It would be a shame

for it to be forgotten now.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's for the best.

</line>


<line>
I just feel so bad for <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

She was so good.

</line>


<line>
It's tragic

she won't be remembered for it.

</line>


<line>
Well, nothing we can do

about it now, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clicks tongue, sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I've completed a projection

for female-led films over five years.

</line>


<line>
It's encouraging but vague until I get

the specifics of your dream slate.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what that is!

I don't remember my dreams.

</line>


<line>
Did I ever even have dreams? [sighs]

</line>


<line>
If you leave now,

you can still make your show.

</line>


<line>
My job is to be here when you are.

</line>


<line>
No. Don't give your whole life

to this job,

because if you do, someday someone

will finally ask you what you want

and you'll realize

you don't even know anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-I'm sorry to miss it.

</line>


<line>
You missing it

will make eye contact easier tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Gronkle</name> has been re-cutting

old episodes of <ital>The <name type="PERSON">Cosby</name> Show</ital>

to take out all the <name type="PERSON">Cosby</name> scenes.

</line>


<line>
-They call it "The Show."

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
They wanna try something similar

with "<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around."

</line>


<line>
So, it'll just be "Around"?

</line>


<line>
It'll just be around eight minutes

an episode,

which is perfect

for today's ADD-addled youth.

</line>


<line>
It's about three precocious orphans

living without any adult supervision,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> learn that wisdom and guidance

can be found everywhere.

</line>


<line>
It's all "around."

</line>


<line>
Well, sounds like

you got it all figured out.

</line>


<line>
-What do you need me for?

-Your backend.

</line>


<line>
Nobody's going to watch the show

if they think

you're still profiting off it.

</line>


<line>
-I need that money now more than ever.

-We want to buy you out.

</line>


<line>
A one-time payment and then

you're divorced from the show forever.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Oof</name>.

</line>


<line>
Do it for <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
Doesn't she deserve more

than to be remembered

as the girl you killed?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Have you seen the episodes

without me in them?

</line>


<line>
-Mm-hmm.

-And they're good?

</line>


<line>
If you sign that document, you won't need

to worry about that ever again.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Good, let's drink.

</line>


<line>
I'm fine with my water, thanks.

</line>


<line>
You're not fooling anyone

with that water bottle.

</line>


<line>
Let me fix you a real drink.

</line>


<line>
One.

</line>


<line>
Wow, this is a huge crowd for us.

Is everyone from your office here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Not everyone.

When were you scared

that I'd leave the show?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> was gay and I had to convince you

to let us fire him.

</line>


<line>
-Let you?

-You probably don't even remember,

but I had this whole speech

I practiced in the mirror.

</line>


<line>
I was terrified

you were going to call my bluff.

</line>


<line>
<name type="LOC">Bluff</name>? All this time, I thought

there was nothing I could have done...

</line>


<line>
I guess I bluffed good!

-No.

</line>


<line>
No! Why should I give you what you want?

You took everything from me.

</line>


<line>
My job was on the line.

You have no idea--

</line>


<line>
Every stupid decision I made,

every bad thing that has ever happened,

</line>


<line>
-it all started because of you.

-Grow up.

</line>


<line>
You play these games, "if I hadn't

done this, if I wasn't so that,"

but you did and you were and here we are.

</line>


<line>
I can't... I...

</line>


<line>
Here we are!

Because we did what we had to do.

Please! Don't hurt him!

I never got to make it right.

I just want the freets.

No! Stop! [pants, exhales]

-Helen? Are you all right?

</line>


<line>
It's okay. It's not real. I'm fine!

It's a classic Todd shenanigan!

</line>


<line>
But how would you know what that is?

</line>


<line>
I think my wife is having a heart attack.

</line>


<line>
That's Margo Martindale, the actress!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

</line>


<line>
I was too convincing!

Oh, if only I wasn't so good at acting!

</line>


<line>
It's funny, isn't it?

The things that matter?

</line>


<line>
The truth is none of it matters

and the truth is it all matters

tremendously.

</line>


<line>
It's a wonder any of us

ever get out of bed at all.

</line>


<line>
And yet, we get out of bed.

</line>


<line>
I'm going home.

</line>

Someone should get some pleasure out

of something in this sad, stupid world.

</line>


<line>
Consider it a signing bonus.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> And I'm taking these.

</line>


<line>
But the lazy Susans

turned out to be very problematic.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-<ital>Offensive to Susans.</ital>

</line>


<line>
There was a protest

organized by <name type="PERSON">Susan</name> Sarandon.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
Not that many Susans showed up.

You know what they say about Susans.

</line>


<line>
They're lazy?

</line>


<line>
Suddenly you're desperately seeking them.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I don't know

how we got talking about me for so long.

</line>


<line>
You were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell me

about your boyfriend. It's good?

</line>


<line>
It's really good. When I'm with him,

</line>


<line>
I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?

</line>


<line>
Like, every other relationship, I always

felt like a "me" in a relationship.

</line>


<line>
Does that make sense?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah. That makes sense.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. I-I didn't realize

I was doing that.

</line>


<line>
I've always tried to be

an "us" with people

even when I could see

it wasn't a good idea.

</line>


<line>
Now that I'm single, I feel like

I'm finally learning how to be a "me."

</line>


<line>
That's great.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I know there were times you would</ital>

<ital>try to tell me something</ital>

and instead of listening,

I just tried to fix it

or convince you there wasn't a problem.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I shouldn't have done that.</ital>

</line>


<line>
We're all doing our best.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I wanna know now.</ital>

-Know what?

</line>


<line>
Tell me what it's like to be <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay. When you're <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

you can live your whole life

like it's a puzzle,

put together

from the pieces of different sets.

</line>


<line>
Like a crossover puzzle?

</line>


<line>
Exactly.

</line>


<line>
Your whole life is full

of these pieces that don't quite fit.

</line>


<line>
Sounds like a hard puzzle.

</line>


<line>
But at some point,

you start to think it's you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And you spend so long with that feeling</ital>

<ital>that the feeling becomes your home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And it can be jarring

when you discover one day

that you suddenly

don't feel that way anymore.

</line>


<line>
At first, you don't trust it.

</line>


<line>
But then, gradually, you do.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. That was a weird thing

to be telling my ex-husband.

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
-I'm really happy for you, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

<ital>-It's funny.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I feel like if we met each other

as the people we are now,

things would be totally different with us.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but if we hadn't met

each other until now,

we wouldn't be the people we are now.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Two equally accomplished book writers.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
-[roars, laughs]

-[screams]

</line>


<line>
You suffered an anxiety attack.

</line>


<line>
I'd encourage you to avoid

stressful situations like, uh,

fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.

</line>


<line>
Okay, paperwork time.

</line>


<line>
You seem like a fellow w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> enjoys

unnecessary bureaucracy.

</line>


<line>
I do, Doctor.

</line>


<line>
Mm, was that the bridge

where they shot <ital>Grease?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-That's neat.

</line>


<line>
Todd, I'm so sorry!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--

</line>


<line>
I thought kicking you out

was the right thing.

</line>


<line>
You were 18.

You had dropped out of high school.

</line>


<line>
You were always high.

You only wore flip-flops.

</line>


<line>
-You never showered.

-You don't have to list everything.

</line>


<line>
I wanted you to grow up,

not leave forever.

</line>


<line>
Then more and more time passed

and I didn't know how to make it right.

</line>


<line>
Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.

</line>


<line>
I haven't had a mom for so long, I...

I don't really need one anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh. So, what do we do now?

</line>


<line>
Well, I do have one idea.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-A big robot suit like in <ital>Aliens,</ital>

but for babies

so they can do grown-up things!

</line>


<line>
-That sounds dangerous.

-Yeah, I guess it is.

</line>


<line>
But maybe the robots could be powered

by energy generated

from sucking on pacifiers.

</line>


<line>
That is so smart! Babies love sucking

and right now it's just wasted energy!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Margo's voice]</nonVerbComm> And so you see,

the circle had become complete.

</line>


<line>
All the twists and turns had all been

part of a beautiful tapestry,

a grander mission to bring this boy

and his mother together again.

</line>


<line>
That's quite a story.

But you've killed a lot of people.

</line>


<line>
-Margo Martindale, you're going to pris--

</line>


<line>
I find it hard to believe Margo Martindale

has never appeared in your work.

</line>

in my new film, "Classroom Warfare."

I know.

</line>


<line>
Would you think I was an idiot

if I didn't go work for Turteltaub?

</line>


<line>
I would never think you were an idiot.

</line>


<line>
This slate we're putting together...

[stammers]

</line>


<line>
We could get some financiers

and do it ourselves, right?

</line>


<line>
If there's one thing I know

about this business,

it's never underestimate

what Princess Carolyn can do by herself.

</line>


<line>
Well, not all by myself.

</line>


<line>
Well... [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I've got the babysitter 'til 11:00.

We might as well keep working, right?
