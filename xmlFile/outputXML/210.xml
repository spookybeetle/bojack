</line>


<line>
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

</line>


<line>
Think she's dreaming that

she's not overstaying her welcome?

</line>


<line>
When she got that wine delivered

to the house,

</line>


<line>
I thought that was her thank-you present,

that she was leaving,

</line>


<line>
-but then she just drank the wine.

-Five days ago.

</line>


<line>
-Morning, everybody.

-Aah! <name type="PERSON">Kinko</name>!

</line>


<line>
Another beautiful day

in the city of <name type="ORG">Brotherly Angels</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, I don't recall

accidentally ingesting poison,

and yet here you are

trying to make me vomit.

</line>


<line>
You wanna go buy me a kite

and then fly a kite?

</line>


<line>
No. Kites are sky trash.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

Why is it so daytime right now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?

That's what I call wind.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

</line>


<line>
Not all of us. Just some of us.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, my job.

</line>


<line>
-Morning.

-[J.D.] What?

</line>


<line>
I'm done with my sabbatical

and I'm ready to get back to work.

</line>


<line>
What sabbatical? I fired you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I thought

when you said, "You're fired,"

that was just you

"giving me the business."

</line>


<line>
No, I was taking the "business"

away from you.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

You wanna go fly a kite?

</line>


<line>
Put me down

for a supersized "sounds great."

</line>


<line>
But with an even larger main course

of "sadly, I cannot."

</line>


<line>
I am swamped here at work.

First, I gotta put my suit on.

</line>


<line>
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

</line>


<line>
Then we record the show.

</line>


<line>
And then I gotta take my suit off.

</line>


<line>
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ah.

</line>


<line>
"Looking for a friend?"

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
"Need direction?"

</line>


<line>
I'm listening.

</line>


<line>
"Try Scientology"?

</line>


<line>
-Huh.

-Excuse me? Sir?

</line>


<line>
-Huh?

-Have you ever thought

about trying improv comedy?

</line>


<line>
Improv comedy? I don't know...

</line>


<line>
Why not?

It's not like there's anything else to do.

</line>


<line>
Here on <name type="LOC">Mars</name>.

</line>


<line>
We're on <name type="LOC">Mars</name>?

</line>


<line>
Yes. And in a <name type="NORP">Martian</name> ice cream shop.

Care for a butterscotch swirl?

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
The only limit is my imagination.

</line>


<line>
Why not come by our theater

and try a free class?

</line>


<line>
Okay!

Can I bring this food inside the theater?

</line>


<line>
Ha, good one.

</line>


<line>
-But no.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
"That's when I learned

that guns can blow a <ital>vato </ital>away.

</line>


<line>
But calculus?

Calculus can blow a mind away."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Abe</name>]</nonVerbComm> Cut!

</line>


<line>
We got it!

</line>


<line>
That's the day, everybody.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-You sure we got it, <name type="PERSON">Abe</name>?

-Of course. You were phenomenal.

</line>


<line>
Really? Because that kid sneezed

in the middle of my monologue.

</line>


<line>
-We can fix that in post.

-<name type="PERSON">Abe</name>, I'm supposed to tell you

</line>


<line>
the boom mike fell into the last shot.

</line>


<line>
You sure you don't wanna get another take?

Just for safety?

</line>


<line>
What am I, <name type="PERSON">Kubrick</name>?

We can fix all this stuff in post.

</line>


<line>
It's an easy scene.

</line>


<line>
Secretariat's a nice guy,

the <name type="NORP">Spanish</name> kids learn a lesson.

</line>


<line>
Boom. Bam! Done!

</line>


<line>
But Secretariat never actually taught math

in <name type="LOC">South Central</name>.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what Secretariat did

or didn't do. I wasn't there.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, but--

-Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

</line>


<line>
we'll give them gangbangers.

</line>


<line>
-We get paid either way, right?

-I guess.

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to get home.

I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

</line>


<line>
You like coq au vin?

</line>


<line>
I think so. Is that the move

where a <name type="NORP">French</name> girl pours soup in--

</line>


<line>
Come over for dinner, okay?

</line>


<line>
-You'll love it.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Chin</name> up, big guy.

So, we ain't making <ital>Casablanca.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. Shut up.

-Aah! What are you--?

</line>


<line>
No one can know I'm here.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

</line>


<line>
As you know, you're my favorite client.

</line>


<line>
If I left <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name>,

would you follow me to a new agency?

</line>


<line>
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me

after this movie comes out.

</line>


<line>
The script turned into a piece of shit,

and the director is a total hack.

</line>


<line>
Good guy, total hack.

</line>


<line>
Let's get you something

before the movie comes out.

</line>


<line>
We got an offer in for this new play

off-Broadway.

</line>


<line>
Theater? That's what real actors do.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I told them that,

but they said she wanted you.

</line>


<line>
-She?

-Yeah, this hot new playwright <name type="PERSON">Jill</name> Pill.

</line>


<line>
-She came out of nowhere.

-<name type="PERSON">Jill</name> Pill?

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="GPE">New York</name> Magazine </ital>called her

the <ital>enfant terrible</ital>

of the immersive theater world,

and then later clarified

that that's a compliment.

</line>


<line>
It sounds like the kind of thing

I should be doing now.

</line>


<line>
-Something artistic and bold.

-Rehearsals start in two weeks.

</line>


<line>
Are you ready to go to <name type="GPE">New York</name>

for six months?

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">New York</name>'s a great city to live in

for six months

and not a second longer and only

if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

</line>


<line>
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Apple sauce!

</line>


<line>
Oh-ho!

</line>


<line>
That was so funny.

</line>


<line>
Which one of you guys

wrote all those funny jokes?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, here at <name type="ORG">Shenanigags</name>,

we make things up on the spot.

</line>


<line>
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.

-Uh... I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Suggestions?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

</line>


<line>
-Way to break the fourth wall.

-That wasn't that funny.

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>

and you haven't won me over yet.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, in improv,

we get suggestions from an audience

then make up scenes based on them.

</line>


<line>
There are just a few simple rules.

You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

</line>


<line>
No matter what. When someone makes a

suggestion, you always try to build on it.

</line>


<line>
We call that "yes, and..."

</line>


<line>
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.

It's all part of the fun.

</line>


<line>
Is it really that simple?

</line>


<line>
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated

and requires years of training.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
But improv isn't just about a constant

clamoring for attention and validation.

</line>


<line>
It's about community.

</line>


<line>
I've always wanted to be part

of a community.

</line>


<line>
Well, you are now.

Your first class is $200.

</line>


<line>
I thought you said it was free.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

</line>


<line>
I am so proud of you.

</line>


<line>
Every day I'm telling people all about

the great stuff you're doing there.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, I don't know--

-<ital>And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."</ital>

</line>


<line>
And I say, "I'm here to confirm

she is an incredible woman."

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Well--</ital>

-You know, the sound guy's wife

works with at-risk teens.

</line>


<line>
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,

but compared to what my wife is doing,

</line>


<line>
-your wife is bullshit!"

-<ital>Oh.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And he had to agree with me.

</line>


<line>
-Um--

-Because I am his boss.

</line>


<line>
-Listen--

-<ital>Let me talk to one of the locals.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I wanna hear someone else talk

about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, uh...

-Ah, now come on.

</line>


<line>
-Most refugees got their tongues cut out.

-Find one with a tongue.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>I don't think--</ital>

-Indulge me.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[in softer voice]</nonVerbComm>

Hello. I am refugee from village.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

</line>


<line>
Uh, my name is...

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Coffee <name type="ORG">Maker</name></name>.

[groans]

</line>


<line>
Ah. <name type="PERSON">Kofi Makir</name>.

Am I pronouncing that right?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, you had some killer provs

in class today.

</line>


<line>
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene

was so innovative.

</line>


<line>
Eh...

</line>


<line>
-Oh, <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>.

-Guys, look.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Who's that?

-What are you, new?

</line>


<line>
Yes, I am new.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Copernicus</name> is the founder of <name type="ORG">Shenanigags</name>.

</line>


<line>
That guy is the Jan-<name type="PERSON">Ove Waldner</name>

of modern improv.

</line>


<line>
-Who is Jan-<name type="PERSON">Ove Waldner</name>?

-The <name type="PERSON">Michael Jordan</name> of table tennis.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Let's go talk to him.

-Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
You can't just go up and talk

to <name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>.

</line>


<line>
Man, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, you don't know shit.

You're just a tourist.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not.

</line>


<line>
If you're one of us, prove it.

Go improv that lady over there.

</line>


<line>
Freestyle.

</line>


<line>
No audience, no net.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know...

-Hey, if you're down with the prov,

you gotta prove that prov.

</line>


<line>
All right. I'll do it.

</line>


<line>
-Hello, old ma'am.

-Oh, hello.

</line>


<line>
I'm just waiting for my friend <name type="PERSON">Doris</name>.

Have you seen her?

</line>


<line>
Yes,

and she exploded?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Doris</name> exploded?

</line>


<line>
-You just got prov'd!

-In your face, lady!

</line>


<line>
The streets are ours!

</line>


<line>
-Hurray, improv! I did it!

-You have briefly won me over.

</line>


<line>
Poor <name type="PERSON">Doris</name>...

</line>


<line>
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.

But it's great.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm no <name type="PERSON">Emeril</name> Lagasse,

but we do get by.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, stop. [laughs]

-Bam!

</line>


<line>
Like <name type="PERSON">Emeril</name>? Ha, remember that?

</line>


<line>
He said "bam."

</line>


<line>
I don't know who <name type="PERSON">Emeril</name> is,

but he sounds delightful.

</line>


<line>
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, <name type="PERSON">Abe</name> tells me

you guys are almost done with the movie.

</line>


<line>
One week left!

</line>


<line>
You two lovebirds gonna do

any traveling or anything?

</line>


<line>
I'll be traveling back and forth

to <name type="GPE">New York</name> for the next few months

because <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s doing a play there

after you finish.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I love plays.

-A play.

</line>


<line>
That's my favorite place

to eat crinkly candies.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work

on something good, you know?

</line>


<line>
Oh?

</line>


<line>
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.

It has been a really painless shoot,

even though the movie's gonna be

a piece of shit, right?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

</line>


<line>
Like shipshape? [giggles]

</line>


<line>
Anyway, what were we talking about?

Who knows?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, moving on.

-Hey, it's fine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Abe</name> knows what we're making.

</line>


<line>
Right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Abe</name> slurps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, would you help me with dessert?

-Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

<name type="GPE">New York</name> is so great in the summer,

but I don't think

we're going to be done in time.

</line>


<line>
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

</line>


<line>
-Are you kidding?

-Well, you know,

because the movie's such a piece of shit

and all.

</line>


<line>
Did that hurt your feelings?

</line>


<line>
I mean, you're the one who said

we're not making <ital>Casablanca.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Right, because <ital>Casablanca </ital>is a movie

about a club owner named <name type="PERSON">Rick</name>.

</line>


<line>
This movie's about Secretariat,

a racehorse.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you literally meant we're not making

the actual movie <ital>Casablanca?</ital>

</line>


<line>
That movie already exists.

Why would we make <ital>Casablanca?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-This is a different movie.

-I think there was a misunderstanding.

</line>


<line>
Wrong, boy-o.

There was a mister-understanding.

</line>


<line>
And that mister is me

understanding you just fine.

</line>


<line>
You come into my home

and you call my work shit?

</line>


<line>
-You know what I think? You're shit.

-What?

</line>


<line>
You think I don't get enough takes?

I'll get more takes.

</line>


<line>
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't go.

We haven't had dessert yet.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Shirley</name>'s lemon meringue? <name type="PERSON">Mwah</name>.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

</line>


<line>
Because it's a different kind of pie?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurs]</nonVerbComm> That's right.

</line>


<line>
Why did you have to antagonize him?

</line>


<line>
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

</line>


<line>
-He said, "It's no <ital>Casablanca."</ital>

-Well, what's done is done.

</line>


<line>
You're happy.

You didn't want me to go to <name type="GPE">New York</name>.

</line>


<line>
Lucky me, I get to stay here

and work on this movie

that's gonna ruin my career.

</line>


<line>
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

</line>


<line>
Or you could sulk about it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> does raise some good points.

</line>


<line>
No, she doesn't.

</line>


<line>
Besides, I don't think <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>'s the person

you wanna be going to for life advice now.

</line>


<line>
Why? Just because I've been drinking

myself to sleep on your deck chairs

and lying to my husband for the last week?

Hey, there's a <name type="ORG">Cheez</name>-It on the shelf.

</line>


<line>
I knew I kept these things around

for a reason.

</line>


<line>
-I just had the most amazing prov sesh.

-No one cares, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?

Make a suggestion.

</line>


<line>
-Stop.

-Aah. Sorry, officer,

</line>


<line>
I didn't see that stop sign.

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
And my car runs on farts.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> mimics farting]

-[<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>] Ugh!

</line>


<line>
-Stop. No, stop it.

-Please stop.

</line>


<line>
Not a suggestion.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mimics farting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

I just hope I impress the elder council.

</line>


<line>
I want to become a Level Two,

so I can finally achieve clarity

on the <name type="ORG">Mainstage</name> with the chosen ones.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>'s in a cult.

</line>


<line>
What? No, improv is not a cult.

</line>


<line>
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

taught by a for-profit organization

with the promise of social

and professional opportunities.

</line>


<line>
-Ahh.

-It's a cult. And I know.

</line>


<line>
I learned a little about cults

during that year I was a Scientologist.

</line>


<line>
Coincidentally during that year,

I read a book about cults.

</line>


<line>
Wait, are you saying

Scientology is a cult?

</line>


<line>
No, Scientology is not a cult.

</line>


<line>
Improv is a cult.

</line>


<line>
I wanna be very clear.

This is about improv.

</line>


<line>
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.

-Why does anything matter, right?

</line>


<line>
Love is an illusion,

and happiness is fleeting,

no such thing as <name type="PERSON">God</name>, and all your

favorite musicians beat their wives.

</line>


<line>
Allegedly.

</line>


<line>
Would you talk to her?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yes.

</line>


<line>
Yes, and I am a <name type="NORP">Nazi</name> <name type="NORP">Kardashian</name>.

</line>


<line>
Heyyy... Hitler.

</line>


<line>
Please stop.

</line>

President <name type="PERSON">Lohan</name>!

Get away from that fire hose!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Fire hose!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> Sorry I'm late, guys!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, we take tardiness seriously here

at <name type="ORG">Shenanigags</name>.

</line>


<line>
-If you miss one more class, you're out.

-I'm sorry. But, wait, <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name> isn't here.

</line>


<line>
-He's later than I am.

-<name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>'s not gonna be at practice anymore.

</line>


<line>
He's been negative, so <name type="ORG">Copernicus</name> thought

he could benefit from some time away.

</line>


<line>
He's been reassigned to the <name type="ORG">Shenanigags</name>

comedy cruise line, the <ital>Giggleship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Is that a reward or a punishment?

-That's up to <name type="PERSON">Bryan</name>.

</line>


<line>
Let's have no more questions

about the <ital>Giggleship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, all right.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know,

I was actually talking to my best friend,

and he said improv is a cult.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's crazy, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
If you think <name type="ORG">Shenanigags</name> is a cult,

you're free to go, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.

I love this place.

</line>


<line>
My friend just doesn't know

how great you guys are.

</line>


<line>
It sounds like your friend's

not yes-and'ing you.

</line>


<line>
Invite him to your graduation show.

</line>


<line>
If he's too negative to support you,

you should take a good hard think

about if that's the kind of energy

you want in your life.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> I hate good hard thinks.

</line>


<line>
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.

But I-- I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
I'm--

Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

</line>


<line>
The kids get jealous

if I'm talking on the phone.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay, bye.

</line>


<line>
So, hey, hi.

</line>


<line>
How long are you thinking of staying here?

Just for my own reference.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

Is <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> making you get rid of me?

</line>


<line>
No one is making me do anything.

</line>


<line>
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

</line>


<line>
Well, yeah.

</line>


<line>
I really thought I could do it. I thought

I could go far away and help people

and be this best possible version

of myself.

</line>


<line>
And what happened?

</line>


<line>
I couldn't.

</line>


<line>
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

</line>


<line>
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,

but I gotta head out.

</line>


<line>
Today we're filming what used to be the

scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

but is now a scene where he swims

in a fishing hole

</line>


<line>
-with his girlfriend "<name type="PERSON">Susie</name> Side."

-Yeesh.

</line>


<line>
If you wanna blow off work,

I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

drink beer, and watch old episodes

of <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And if I hear one more peep out of you--

</line>


<line>
-[crashing]

-[audience laughs]

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>!

-[<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>] What? I didn't peep!

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience applauding]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> was such a little bitch.

</line>


<line>
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, you're still here.

And <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is here.

</line>


<line>
Did you go to work today?

</line>


<line>
I was gonna, but then I remembered

everything is garbage,

so why bother doing anything?

</line>


<line>
-True story.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[the horse]</nonVerbComm><ital> Oh, you didn't.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Oh, you did.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sitcom theme plays over TV]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello.

-Hey, could you get the door?

</line>


<line>
-Whoa.

-Mm.

</line>


<line>
The property's gonna be ready in June.

Gives us two months

to get everything we need

out of this place.

</line>


<line>
Mm. Perfect.

</line>


<line>
Just so you know, I had to register

the corporation in your name.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Just until the divorce is finalized.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Katie</name>'s lawyers are watching me closely

right now.

</line>


<line>
They're hawks.

</line>


<line>
I mean, not literally.

Well, one literally.

</line>


<line>
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name>, this is too--

</line>


<line>
This is a temporary technicality,

I promise.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.

Okay?

</line>


<line>
Mm. Mm.

</line>


<line>
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,

so I just-- Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, hello.

-Look at this urn.

</line>


<line>
What's going on in here?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name> and I are starting a new agency,

and we want you to come with us.

</line>


<line>
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

</line>


<line>
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

</line>


<line>
Are you in or out?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
You're the agent who got me

<ital>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Well--

-<ital>What do they know?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Right, so--

-<ital>Do they know things?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Okay--

-<ital>Let's find out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Right--

-Big fan.

</line>


<line>
I like you guys.

</line>


<line>
I like your hustle

and I like your matching lipstick.

</line>


<line>
-Well, um--

-I am in.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hm.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Go home, Goober.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm> Goober sucks.

Why doesn't he ever go home?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

</line>


<line>
-You suck, Goober!

-Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

</line>


<line>
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, guys.

-Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, listen, I-- Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Hey, whoa!

-Boo! Party foul!

</line>


<line>
-You knocked over <name type="GPE">Bucking</name>-can Palace.

-Come on!

</line>


<line>
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

</line>


<line>
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."

Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

</line>


<line>
Clean up your shit, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I wanted to invite you

to my graduation show tomorrow night.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Look, I know you think

it's just a dumb cult,

but you're my best friend

and it would really mean a lot

if you came.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> I'm gonna go down to the basement

to practice my space work.

</line>


<line>
And here I am going downstairs.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
-What kind of pants are you wearing now?

-What? I don't know. The normal kind.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?

A comfy pair of pants?

</line>


<line>
I guess. Why?

</line>


<line>
Just wondering

what kind of hit you're gonna take

when the studio sues the pants off you

for breach of contract.

</line>


<line>
They're suing me?

Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

</line>


<line>
Because that was a long road to walk

to get to that punch line.

</line>


<line>
-This is serious.

-We're not just doing bits?

</line>


<line>
You started it with the pants thing.

</line>


<line>
You need to go back to set.

You can't just not go to work.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Remember, you wanted this.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you saying you're finally ready

to settle down with yours truly?

</line>


<line>
Darn tootin'.

I may be a professional racehorse,

but I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Abe</name>]</nonVerbComm> Cut!

</line>


<line>
Perfect.

But let's get that last part again.

</line>


<line>
-Anything you want me to do differently?

-No, I just think we should get it again.

</line>


<line>
You know, for safety.

</line>


<line>
-Action!

-I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps]</nonVerbComm> And again?

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
Why don't we get it like five more times?

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Abe</name>]</nonVerbComm> Let's get it ten more times.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Ta-da!

-We did it.

</line>


<line>
-What now?

-We die, have our guts ripped out

through our noses,

and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

can I talk to you for a minute?

</line>


<line>
Ooh...

</line>


<line>
Alone, please?

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

</line>


<line>
-Right now. You and me.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I booked us a room for the weekend.

Pack your bags, let's go.

</line>


<line>
Where? Why?

</line>


<line>
Less asking, more basking.

</line>


<line>
In the sun, that is. Santa <name type="PERSON">Barbara</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I'm not really in the mood for--

-I think some time away

could be really good for us, as a couple.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
I know you've been really bummed out

about the movie,

but I don't think moping around the house

with <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> all day is healthy.

</line>


<line>
All I've ever wanted

was to be in this movie,

and you just want me

to put on a happy face--

</line>


<line>
Yes. There are lots of people

who don't like their jobs.

</line>


<line>
Doesn't mean

they have to bring it home with--

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

-What is that supposed to mean?

</line>


<line>
Well, come on.

You're a network executive.

</line>


<line>
You don't give a shit about work.

</line>


<line>
I actually have a lot of pride

in what I do.

</line>


<line>
What? You have a lot of pride?

</line>


<line>
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

hoping some of the garbage

stinks less than the rest

so you can quietly renew that garbage

and keep failing sideways

until you retire

to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

in <name type="GPE">Beverly Garbage</name>

and spend the rest of your life

</line>


<line>
-watching your former assistant's garbage.

-I don't know where this is coming from.

</line>


<line>
Every good thing

that ever happened to you happened

because of network executives like me.

</line>


<line>
That show you spend all day watching,

your house, your career--

</line>


<line>
Great house, great career, great life!

Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

</line>


<line>
-You don't know--

-I don't?

</line>


<line>
My life was ruined

by a network executive like you.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry

that things have been so hard for you,

but that doesn't give you the right to be

shitty to me. I can't be around someone

who's just fueled

by bitterness and negativity.

</line>


<line>
Well then, what are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
What happened, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Same thing that always happens.

</line>


<line>
You didn't know me.

Then you fell in love with me.

</line>


<line>
And now you know me.

</line>


<line>
You know, it's funny. When you look

at someone through rose-colored glasses,

all the red flags just look like flags.

</line>


<line>
-So, <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>'s moving out.

-Oh, shit. Because of me?

</line>


<line>
No. Because of me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode

of <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Where <name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> does the school project

where she pretends an egg is a baby.

</line>


<line>
Spoiler alert:

<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> needs to make an omelet.

</line>


<line>
Why won't you go home?

</line>


<line>
I should. I know I should.

</line>


<line>
I wish I could just go home right now

and crawl into bed

and not have to talk about anything

or explain anything.

</line>


<line>
He would just say, "How was your day?"

And then he would say,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, did you know the monorail

was invented by <name type="PERSON">George</name> Monorail?"

</line>


<line>
And I would say,

"I don't think that's true."

</line>


<line>
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't

invent it, he certainly perfected it."

</line>


<line>
And I wouldn't have to say,

"I'm sorry I left.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I'm not the person

I thought I was."

</line>


<line>
I would just say, "My day was good."

</line>


<line>
And he would say, "I love you."

</line>


<line>
The longer you keep lying to him,

the harder it's gonna get.

</line>


<line>
Can I ask you something?

</line>


<line>
That play in <name type="GPE">New York</name>,

would that really have made you happy?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

</line>


<line>
And if <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> didn't get fired,

and you got to make the movie

you wanted to make,

would that have made you happy?

</line>


<line>
For a little bit.

</line>


<line>
But then...

</line>


<line>
Probably...

</line>


<line>
So, what does it matter?

</line>


<line>
But there has to be more.

</line>


<line>
Well, when's the last time

you were actually happy?

</line>


<line>
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Microchip.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>

-[all laughing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Hey. How are you?

</line>


<line>
I can't do this anymore.

</line>


<line>
You can't do what anymore?

</line>


<line>
I can't talk to you on the phone

all the time.

</line>


<line>
It's too hard.

</line>


<line>
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

</line>


<line>
I think maybe we should stop

calling each other, for a little bit.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

</line>


<line>
But listen, I love you. Okay?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
I love you, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Where is he?

-I don't know, sir.

</line>


<line>
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?
