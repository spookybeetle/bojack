<line>
Whoo! Come on, Baby Humans!

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh. You gotta try

a <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>-style baked potato.

</line>


<line>
Why does everything

have to be "<name type="GPE">Chicago</name>-style" here?

</line>


<line>
We get it. We're in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Come on. Just try it.

-[scoffs] Look at this.

</line>


<line>
Fork and knife individually wrapped.

</line>


<line>
-So much plastic!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Oops.

-Yeah. "Oops."

</line>


<line>
Or the <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> Baby Humans are owned

by the brother of the CEO of <name type="ORG">Plastico</name>.

</line>


<line>
And we are thereby complicit

in this incestuous money-laundering

scheme that's, oh,

by the way, killing the planet.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> But what are you gonna do, right?

-Good morning, beautiful.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
Wanna go try and hit

a <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>-style museum?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'd love to, but I really have

to work on my book. Next time.

</line>


<line>
Great! I've made my romantic offer.

I've officially been a good boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
I will now retreat to our living room

to play video games all day.

<line>
Hello. I am <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

and I am a young girl living in <name type="GPE">Boston</name>

and ever since I was that,

</line>


<line>
I wanted to write good things

that were good,

this is not good, fix this later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, as your father,

I am very unsupportive.

</line>


<line>
Come up with examples

of <name type="PERSON">Dad</name> being unsupportive.

</line>


<line>
Okay, yes.

And, also, the girls from high school.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm <name type="PERSON">Krissy Keating</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can you use my real name?

</line>


<line>
Check if it's okay to use my real name.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I was a real bitch to you,

but now maybe you're realizing

I was bullied, too?

</line>


<line>
-Is any of this interesting?

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]<ital> Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Put me in your book.

Remember I gave you that salad bowl?

</line>


<line>
And I broke the bowl!

</line>


<line>
Answer your phone.

</line>


<line>
And I glued it back together with gold

because I read an article

about the Japanese art of kintsugi!

</line>


<line>
-And it fell apart again.

-It kept falling apart like our marriage!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> Is that something?

Is any of this anything?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital><name type="PERSON">Diane</name>. Answer your phone.</ital>

<ital>I'm calling you right now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzing]

-What?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]<ital> Hey, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
If I had my shitty students

do a night of scenes here

at the end of the semester,

would you come see it?

</line>


<line>
It's gonna suck, so I wanna pack the house

with friendly faces.

</line>


<line>
When you sell it like that,

how can I resist?

</line>


<line>
<ital>How's that book coming?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I'm actually at the mall, writing it now.

-Why are you writing at the mall?

</line>


<line>
I couldn't focus at home

and this is the only place

</line>


<line>
I could sit and work for ten hours.

</line>


<line>
I can get lunch here, I can people-watch,

</line>


<line>
all without having to endure

what the Chicagoans refer to as "spring."

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>, 49 degrees is not spring.

</line>


<line>
-It's the non-Lachey half of a boy band.

<ital>-What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Forty-nine! Half of 98?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, don't workshop your material

in casual conversation.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Howie Mandel</name> used to do it, too.

Like, really, Howie?

</line>


<line>
You just happened to have a rubber glove

in your pocket?

</line>


<line>
All I need to do now

is actually write my book.

</line>


<line>
I have so many stories to tell,

but I can't seem to figure out

what the book is.

</line>


<line>
You gonna put any stories

about me in there?

</line>


<line>
-I think I've written about you enough.

<ital>-But no one else is as good at it!</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm sure someone will rise

to the occasion.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>, darling, I've just a moment

to update you on the progress

of our Penny <name type="PERSON">Carson</name> crusade.

</line>


<line>
So far, we've been able to contact three

of the four Carsons

</line>


<line>
listed in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>, there's nowhere I'd rather be

than on our honeymoon cruise to "Unjuga,"

</line>


<line>
but I simply can't stop now.

</line>


<line>
We're on the lookout for the fourth Penny,

and, <name type="PERSON">God</name> willing, she'll be the lucky one.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Hey.

</line>


<line>
-Caw-caw! Caw-caw!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Oh... [stammers]

Sorry, I didn't mean you. <name type="PERSON">Paige</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Kisses, <name type="PERSON">Baxter</name> dear,

it appears we've found our deer.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Book, here we go.

</line>


<line>
I grow up in <name type="GPE">Boston</name> town

because my father,

who I never was close with,

live in <name type="GPE">Boston</name>.

</line>


<line>
That's not right English,

I'll fix it later.

</line>


<line>
Me from <name type="GPE">Boston</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, you're not from <name type="GPE">Boston</name>, but yeah.

</line>


<line>
-Whatever for now.

-Beantown.

</line>


<line>
To really understand

what it's like to grow up in <name type="GPE">Boston</name>,

you actually have to go back 250 years

to the <name type="GPE">Boston</name> Tea Party.

</line>


<line>
Taxation without representation

is wicked unjust, bro!

</line>


<line>
Bro, check it out.

I'm teabaggin' the harbor.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no freakin' way.

</line>


<line>
-[laughs]

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Go, <name type="PERSON">Pats</name>. Unrelated.

-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Stop.

</line>


<line>
-I'm getting distracted.

-Why can't you stay focused?

</line>


<line>
What's wrong with your head, Deedee?

</line>


<line>
The idea behind

the Japanese art of kintsugi

</line>


<line>
is that cracks in an object

are part of its history.

</line>


<line>
-What does that have to do with anything?

-We have to look at trauma!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> We totally have to look at Trauma.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-There's a spring sale.

</line>


<line>
Forty percent off.

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting, groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ivy]</nonVerbComm> Did you hear

security still can't figure out

who's stealing wallets? Like... [scoffs]

</line>


<line>
I bet my life it's that hag <name type="PERSON">Devon</name>

from the hair crimper cart.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, yes,

that theory is beast, Ivy.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me, I'm sorry...

-We forgive you.

</line>


<line>
You know the story about <name type="GPE">Gemberly</name>, right?

What they found in her locker?

</line>


<line>
-Tell me.

-It was a--

</line>


<line>
I meant "Pardon me, I need another size."

</line>


<line>
But I can't seem to find

a number on the tag?

</line>


<line>
-We don't see size here at Trauma.

-Okay, but can you help me?

</line>


<line>
Sure. I think it would help

if you figured out

why you need to put a number on your body,

and let me get back to this mystery.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzing, beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ivy]</nonVerbComm> Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

she's like taking a phone call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>! Great news!

</line>


<line>
"Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>" premiered last night

to a 0.006,

which is the biggest network hit

since the inventor

of blood-scented perfume

went on <ital>Shark Tank</ital>

and got her arm bitten off.

</line>


<line>
Great!

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, my company's running

like gangbusters.

</line>


<line>
Is gangbusters a slur of some sort?

</line>


<line>
-Can we still say gangbusters?

-I'll look into it.

</line>


<line>
And with <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> watching the baby,

my work-life balance is on point.

</line>


<line>
-Did you call me just to brag?

<ital>-I was thinking...</ital>

</line>


<line>
What would make my work-life balance

even on pointier?

</line>


<line>
And it hit me: more work!

</line>


<line>
So, I thought I'd check in

and see how your book's doing.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I'm still kind of figuring out

what the "is" of it is, you know?

</line>


<line>
-It's been six months.

-Okay, I think it's about...

</line>


<line>
-Trauma.

<ital>-Trauma?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Or... damage.

</line>


<line>
You know, those bowls that break

and then the cracks get filled with gold

and then they're even more beautiful?

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's like that, you know?

</line>


<line>
Like, we've all been damaged,

but it's good damage

because it makes us more who we are.

</line>


<line>
Is that anything?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, good damage. I like it.

</line>


<line>
Send me the pages

and we'll get 'em to the publisher.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but no hurry?

</line>


<line>
Okay, but, no. Hurry.

</line>


<line>
What can I get ya?

</line>


<line>
Some information

with a side order of revelation.

</line>


<line>
Is that a type of pasta?

</line>


<line>
Oh, also a water. I am parched.

</line>


<line>
In fact, why don't you freeze

that water into a cube shape

and drop it in some bourbon.

</line>


<line>
We're looking to identify

an associate of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>? Is this about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Is it about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're looking for,

but I don't know anything about it.

</line>


<line>
Okay? I haven't seen <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> in years.

Or <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
But you have seen them?

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go ask the kitchen

about your pasta.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Wait, that's the fellow

from the police report,

who found the dead girl

in the planetarium.

</line>


<line>
-Yes?

-<ital>Found</ital> the dead girl.

</line>


<line>
-Are you smelling what I'm smelling?

-[snorts]

</line>


<line>
If he was also with her

at the AA meeting...

</line>


<line>
Well, then why wouldn't he mention it

to the police? What's he hiding?

</line>


<line>
You're starting to make more sense

than a change machine.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, speaking of cents,

what happened to Penny?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop!

-Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop!

</line>


<line>
"So in a way, that salad bowl was me,

and the cracks... were also me..."

</line>


<line>
-Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.

-It's a first draft.

</line>


<line>
I can't remember what happened when

and I keep getting distracted.

</line>


<line>
It's because of the meds.

This is what I was afraid would happen.

</line>


<line>
But isn't it worth it?

</line>


<line>
You've been feeling

so much better, right?

</line>


<line>
I do feel lighter, and clearer,

but also so foggy.

</line>


<line>
You feel clear and foggy?

How is that even possible?

</line>


<line>
-I don't know! Because of the fog.

-Hey. Stick with it.

</line>


<line>
-With the writing? Or the fog?

-Both.

</line>


<line>
Okay. So, start at the beginning.

</line>


<line>
I'm a baby.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hey, baby!

</line>


<line>
Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable

upper-middle class home,

surrounded by love?

</line>


<line>
But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.

That's the problem.

</line>


<line>
You were fine!

Name one example of me being a bad dad.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose

on purpose at Boggle

</line>


<line>
so my brothers would think they were,

quote, "wicked smarter than a girl."

</line>


<line>
-That's all you got?

-I got other things!

</line>


<line>
There was lots of shit. Constantly!

I just can't express--

</line>


<line>
Is this what your book is?

Just you complaining?

</line>


<line>
As your target audience,

I'm not hooked yet.

</line>


<line>
You are not my target audience.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ivy]</nonVerbComm> This book is like bore me

with a spoon, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
You know the story about <name type="GPE">Gemberly</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
-What they found in her locker?

-Tell me.

</line>


<line>
It was a note from the thief,

saying where all the wallets were hidden.

</line>


<line>
What? What is this? I'm trying to write

about my childhood trauma.

</line>


<line>
-Who are you?

-I'm Ivy.

</line>


<line>
My mom and I just moved to <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>

from <name type="NORP">Southern</name> <name type="GPE">California</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>What? No. I can't...</ital>

</line>


<line>
My dad died and we needed a new start.

</line>


<line>
I don't really get <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> yet,

and the winters are cold AF,

so I hang out at the mall a lot.

</line>


<line>
Malls are fun!

</line>


<line>
Or "beast," which is slang

that young people like me say.

</line>


<line>
-You're Ivy <name type="PERSON">Tran</name>, right?

-Ivy T. That's me!

</line>


<line>
I-I need help.

</line>


<line>
Someone's been filching onesies

by the twosies

from the fourth floor Baby Hole,

and if I don't figure out whodunnit,

my manager's gonna mount my head

on the wall!

</line>


<line>
Yes, managers can be very annoying.

</line>


<line>
I'll take the case.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, and, also, I'm American.

-[moose] Beast.

</line>


<line>
"Ivy <name type="PERSON">Tran</name>, Food <name type="ORG">Court</name> Detective"?

</line>


<line>
Well, I like this. It's fun.

</line>


<line>
My book is supposed

to be a profound treatise on damage.

</line>


<line>
But I can't even access my damage.

I'm too...

</line>


<line>
-hopped up on goof-berries!

-What the hell is a goof-berry?

</line>


<line>
I need to go to a dark place,

and I can't get there.

</line>


<line>
When I'm with you, when we're out,

I feel good, I feel happy,

but the minute I sit down to write--

</line>


<line>
 You were having trouble writing

this book when you were depressed,

and you're having trouble

now that you're not depressed.

</line>


<line>
Is it possible that you just--

</line>


<line>
-What? That I'm just a shitty writer?

-No.

</line>


<line>
That you just don't wanna write this book.

</line>


<line>
I do, though. It's just hard.

</line>


<line>
But that means it's worthwhile.

Good things are hard.

</line>


<line>
I'm not writing

<ital>The Mall-related Mysteries of Ivy <name type="PERSON">Tran</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles] Why not?

-<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>, come on.

</line>


<line>
-No. You come on.

-You come on.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, I'm gonna tell you

what I always tell my good friend Eileen.

</line>


<line>
-Don't do it.

-Eileen, come on.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs, chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
More drugs, please!

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzes, beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
I soft-pitched your book

to <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> Pitt's company, Plan B,

and <name type="PERSON">Craig Bierko</name>'s company, Plan C.

</line>


<line>
They're very excited

about the movie adaptation.

</line>


<line>
What movie adaptation?

</line>


<line>
Gee, I don't know,

a new <name type="PERSON">Robin Hood</name> adaptation.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, the adaptation of your book!

</line>


<line>
What book?

</line>


<line>
Come to think of it, a new <name type="PERSON">Robin Hood</name>

sounds pretty good. <name type="GPE">Judah</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Maybe from <name type="ORG">Maid <name type="PERSON">Marian</name></name>'s point of view?

-Directed by <name type="GPE">Sofia</name> Coppola?

</line>


<line>
I'll try Ferguson's agent.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You're still on the phone with me!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. The town has really responded

to your pitch about damage.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a pitch!

</line>


<line>
Imagine, all the little Dianes out there,

just waiting to see their story

on the big screen

during a brief <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>-qualifying run

in <name type="GPE">New York</name> and LA.

</line>


<line>
You don't think it's too sad, do you?

</line>


<line>
It wouldn't be better

if I wrote something more fun?

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, sad is the new fun.</ital>

<ital>Besides, the sad is what makes it you!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Really?

<ital>-Yes! Everyone's very excited.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But they wanna see pages.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, do what you do and get me that sad!

</line>


<line>
Just got back word from <name type="GPE">Sofia</name>.

</line>


<line>
She's booked for the next year

developing a new <ital>Peter Pan</ital>

from <name type="ORG">Wendy</name>'s point of view,

and <name type="PERSON">Rebecca</name>'s doing a limited series

about the female ticket-taker

at the cinema

where <name type="PERSON">Batman</name>'s parents got shot.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, that's really empowering.

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Uh... Ngu-yen?

</line>


<line>
N-Ngu-yen?

</line>


<line>
No one?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name> humming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Mom.

-Hey, Pen!

</line>


<line>
-What's wrong?

-Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.

</line>


<line>
A girl can't visit her mom?

Why are you grilling me?

</line>


<line>
Slow down. Breathe.

</line>


<line>
Something happened at work.

</line>


<line>
-Something?

-[both gasp]

</line>


<line>
Or someone...s?

</line>


<line>
Did you follow me home?

</line>


<line>
If you didn't wanna be followed,

you should have been more judicious

with the turn signal.

</line>


<line>
A lady doesn't need to always announce

where she's headed.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Who taught you how to drive?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, can I help you?

-<name type="PERSON">Paige</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name>, intrepid gal reporter.

</line>


<line>
And I'm <name type="PERSON">Max</name>!

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
We're circling a story

on the last days of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

and we're trying to nail down a timeline.

</line>


<line>
We think your <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>

may have played a part. [snorts]

</line>


<line>
I think you should go.

</line>


<line>
Well, it was worth a try.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I did see <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

Right before she died.

</line>


<line>
Oh! It was very worth a try.

</line>


<line>
She came to <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>. With <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa! <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> came to <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>?

-And what happened?

</line>


<line>
-Nothing. I mean--

-Why didn't you tell me?

</line>


<line>
I saw them and told <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> to leave.

That's it.

</line>


<line>
-Were they intoxicated?

-Is <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> ever not intoxicated?

</line>


<line>
-Would you go on the record?

-No, she won't.

</line>


<line>
Excuse us,

we are just about to sit down to dinner.

</line>


<line>
Do you think <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> got <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> drunk?

</line>


<line>
Do you think <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> got <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> drunk?

</line>


<line>
-Penny--

-I'm not a kid, okay?

</line>


<line>
-We should tell them about <name type="PERSON">Maddy</name>.

-No--

</line>


<line>
Who's <name type="PERSON">Maddy</name>?

</line>


<line>
My best friend in high school.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> was living here

and he bought her booze

before the prom

and then she got alcohol poisoning.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, he was living here?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, what's this, a party?

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Did you guys forget to invite <name type="PERSON">Kyle</name>?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>... [sighs]

-Ah, just kidding. Now it's a party.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kyle</name>, these folks

are from the refrigerator repair company.

</line>


<line>
And I just told them

that our refrigerator is working fine

and they were just leaving.

</line>


<line>
Quite. If you think of anything else,

please do give us a call.

</line>


<line>
Ah. You know, the wine fridge

has actually been acting kind of funky.

</line>


<line>
Two refrigerators? Ha!

Give my regards to the Rockafellers.

I couldn't sleep

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm just whistling. <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>-style.

</line>


<line>
Don't. Just please be quiet.

I need to write.

</line>

Okay. Okay. Write on.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales sharply]</nonVerbComm>

You were gonna write today.

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, is the day over?

</line>


<line>
-[retching, coughing]

-Oh, oh, oh!

</line>


<line>
-It's okay. I got it in the plant.

-Oh! Not in the toilet?

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna put my face in your toilet.

</line>


<line>
-Don't be gross.

-Our toilet, baby. We've been over this.

</line>


<line>
I had to think fast. Went for the plant.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but the sink? Or the shower?

There's so many drains in there.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I gotta work.

</line>


<line>
Hey. [sighs] Maybe you can just go back

to bed and you can work in the morning.

</line>


<line>
No. Now. Gotta get it done.

Your problem is you always blame

other people, Deedee.

<line>
-I know.

-Who's a good baby? Not you!

</line>

Where are my pages, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

I need pages for my beautiful celebrities,

I'm trying to focus.

I'm trying to get to the truth.

-I think you're afraid of the truth.

-No.

</line>


<line>
Your damage isn't interesting

and you're unworthy of love.

</line>


<line>
-No, I'm not!

-Of course you are!

</line>


<line>
Are you, uh, you know,

one of those stupid pop culture analogies

I'm always doing?

</line>


<line>
Because you're charming at first,

but eventually enough already!

You think you're a beautiful salad bowl?

There's a heaviness... on my chest.

<line>
And it's not just my boobs, even though,

yes, my boobs are heavier now.

</line>


<line>
-Hey. Talk to me.

-I stopped taking my meds.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-Because I'm terrible!

</line>


<line>
I'm a stupid person! I deserve this!

</line>


<line>
No. You're not a stupid person,

but you can't just--

</line>


<line>
I want to die!

</line>


<line>
-It's so much worse than before.

-Baby, you're going through withdrawal.

</line>


<line>
Do I just have to be on drugs forever now?

How am I gonna finish my book?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, forget about the book for a second.

-I can't!

</line>


<line>
-It's the only thing that matters.

-Now, that's not true.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so stupid.

I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
It's okay. It's okay.

Just take your pills. All right?

</line>


<line>
Then when you even out we can talk

about trying something else, okay?

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
I just-just wanna be

a beautiful salad bowl.

</line>


<line>
You are a beautiful salad bowl.

</line>


<line>
-How're you doing?

-A little better today.

</line>


<line>
-And, uh, I wanted to say sorry.

-For what?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. "Being <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>"?

</line>


<line>
-Stop.

-I let the stress get to me.

</line>


<line>
I should just call Princess Carolyn

and tell her I need more time.

</line>


<line>
Yes. But before you do that...

don't be mad.

</line>


<line>
Don't be mad about what?

</line>


<line>
If I tell you, will you be mad?

</line>


<line>
From the tone of this conversation,

I'm guessing probably.

</line>


<line>
Okay, what you have to remember

is that you were in a really dark place.

</line>


<line>
And the pressure from Princess Carolyn

wasn't helping.

</line>


<line>
I thought if I could get her off your back

for a few days...

</line>


<line>
What did you do?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>, what did you do?

</line>


<line>
I sent her the <ital>Ivy <name type="PERSON">Tran</name>:</ital>

<ital>Food <name type="ORG">Court</name> Detective</ital> pages.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Okay?

</line>


<line>
-I made an executive decision!

-You're not an executive!

</line>


<line>
I-I made a boyfriend decision! All right?

</line>


<line>
I made a "my girlfriend

is a depressed, vomiting mess

and someone needs to make a decision"

decision.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
-Hello? No.

<ital>-[Princess Carolyn] Loved it!</ital>

</line>


<line>
I love the protagonist, I love the world,

</line>


<line>
I love that it wasn't your sad memoir

about your boring life.

</line>


<line>
What happened to "sad is the new fun"?

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you could write this fun!

You gotta finish this thing.

</line>


<line>
I'm on pins and needles,

and I'm not just saying that

</line>


<line>
-because I live with a porcupine.

-Listen--

</line>


<line>
To the ka-ching, ka-ching

of the middle-grade IP market? Done!

</line>


<line>
I slipped the pages to a few studios.

</line>


<line>
This has franchise potential.

</line>


<line>
But what I'm saying is that it doesn't,

because that's not the book I'm writing.

</line>

-I'm hearing a maybe.

-I'm not--

</line>


<line>

<nonVerbComm>[Ivy]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Here's a mystery.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Why are you so sad-core?

</line>


<line>
-I don't know.

-Just be fun and popular like me.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know how.

-Sure, you do!

</line>


<line>
I'm clever and free-spirited

and a little bit sardonic

but not so much that it's off-putting.

</line>


<line>
I have vulnerabilities like everybody else

but just enough to make me relatable.

</line>


<line>
-That's the way to be.

-It's not that easy.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know.

</line>


<line>
But wouldn't it be nice if it was?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> cooing]

-Where's Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
She said we should save her a seat.

You still working on that memoir?

</line>


<line>
Well, funny story about that--

</line>


<line>
Oh, I love when stories start like that!

Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

</line>


<line>
-Hello. Thank you.

-[cheering]

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow. Thank you.

That's very nice. Thank you.

Welcome to "An Evening

Oh, excuse me.

This episode of "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>"

is an all-timer!

</line>


<line>
-Penny...

-I wanted to get something.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I don't feel good about

what happened with those reporters.

</line>


<line>
-It's okay.

-We didn't tell them... everything.

</line>


<line>
I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.

</line>


<line>
I know that's messed up,

but I think I look nice here.

</line>


<line>
Oh! You look beautiful.

</line>


<line>
I don't think that's the only reason

I kept the photo, Mom.

It's all really confusing.

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kyle</name>]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>! Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>

just got trapped in a leap year!

-How's he gonna wriggle outta this one?

-In a minute, honey!

</line>


<line>
Stuff happened to us, okay?

And he's still out there.

</line>


<line>
-Penny--

-If we can get the word out,

</line>


<line>
-if-if people knew--

-It won't be just him in the story.

</line>


<line>
It'll be you and me. The mistakes we made.

</line>


<line>
Mistakes I made,

that I will never forgive myself for.

</line>


<line>
But if we can help other people,

then it will have been for something,

you know?

</line>


<line>
It won't just be this thing

to feel bad about forever.

</line>


<line>
You don't know what's gonna happen

with the story once it's out there.

</line>


<line>
You have no power over it.

</line>


<line>
And you just got your panic attacks

under control.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know, but--

</line>


<line>
I love that you want to do what's right,

but please just think about it, okay?

</line>


<line>
Just give it a couple days

and then if you still want to talk

to them, you can call them.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
You wanna stay and watch "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>"?

</line>


<line>
-Stay the night?

-No, I-I should go.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Yeah. I love you.

</line>


<line>
I love you, too.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kyle</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh! Is that the International

Date Line?

</line>

anymore! [laughs]

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, let's go.

</line>


<line>
But I wanna see

if there's an after-credits scene.

</line>


<line>
-[Princess Carolyn] Talk soon, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

-Hey, wait a minute.

</line>


<line>
-[door opens, closes]

-Princess Carolyn. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, wait.

</line>


<line>
I understand you're trying to be helpful,

</line>


<line>
-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.

-Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna write

a middle-grade fiction detective series.

</line>


<line>
I think you do, though.

</line>


<line>
Because when I was reading it,

I could tell you were having fun.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but I'm not writing a book

to have fun.

</line>


<line>
If I don't write my book of essays now,

I never will!

</line>


<line>
So? Don't write your book of essays.

</line>


<line>
-I have to!

-Why?

</line>


<line>
Because if I don't,

that means that all the damage I got

isn't good damage, it's just damage.

</line>


<line>
I have gotten nothing out of it,

and all those years

I was miserable was for nothing.

</line>


<line>
I could have been happy this whole time

and written books about girl detectives

and been cheerful and popular

and had good parents,

is that what you're saying?

What was it all for?

</line>


<line>
I...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't know, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
All I know is that this book

about the girl detective is fun.

</line>


<line>
I liked it.

</line>


<line>
I like thinking that my daughter

could grow up in a world

with books like that.

</line>


<line>
Or if my daughter's not a reader,

a lucrative film adaptation.

</line>


<line>
When I was a little girl,

I thought that everything,

all the abuse and neglect,

it somehow made me special,

and I decided that one day

I would write something

that would make little girls like me

feel less alone.

</line>


<line>
And if I can't write that book...

</line>


<line>
Then...

</line>


<line>
Then maybe write this other book.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe this book does that, too.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
