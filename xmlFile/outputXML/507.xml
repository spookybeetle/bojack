<line>
-I know, I know.

-I'm just glad you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed up.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he waitstaff was starting

to get suspicious.

</line>


<line>
See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!

</line>


<line>
-All right. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're trying to embarrass me.

-And I did. And now I'm fine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>, you.

<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>, you. [kisses]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng day at the office?

</line>


<line>
-I lost them, <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>.

-No.

</line>


<line>
In all my years of corporate mediation,

</line>


<line>
I've never been <name type="ORG">un</name>able to resolve

a dispute before it goes to arbitration.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ry-<name type="PERSON">Beth</name>, the Mediating <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ven.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure you helped them

in ways you'll never even know.

</line>


<line>
-I-- Don't therapize me.

-[chuckles] But you're so easy!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u make me feel like

I'm actually good at it.

</line>


<line>
What's going on with you?

</line>


<line>
-It's been a tough week.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me.

</line>


<line>
Mm...

</line>


<line>
-I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't talk about my clients.

-Come on.

</line>


<line>
What if you changed all the names

and identifying characteristics?

</line>


<line>
Okay. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a story about...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>... <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>... <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>, the <name type="ORG">Angsty</name> Zebra.

-[writing]

-[<name type="PERSON">Indira</name>] <ital>So, it all started on <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nday.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was in a session with <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>...a! <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ry-<name type="PERSON">Beth</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Like <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana,</ital>

<ital>Princess of Whales?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Indira</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Exactly.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's just so tough

being Princess of Whales.

</line>


<line>
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're deflecting.

-I'm not!

</line>


<line>
Let's talk about the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name> tape.

</line>


<line>
What's the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name> tape?

</line>


<line>
She recently came into possession

of an audiotape

</line>


<line>
of her friend and co-worker,

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>, the <name type="ORG">Angsty</name> Zebra.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>On the boat. <name type="PERSON">T</name>here was a girl.</ital>

<ital>In <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What girl is he talking about?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
"Girl" so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g, right? [scoffs]

Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,

</line>


<line>
because, otherwise,

why wouldn't he tell me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana, you are not responsible

for the dysf<name type="ORG">un</name>ction of others.

</line>


<line>
I actually explore this in my book,

</line>


<line>
<ital>Are <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u Responsible</ital>

<ital>For <name type="PERSON">T</name>he Dysf<name type="ORG">un</name>ction of Others?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Spoiler alert: <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not!

</line>


<line>
I just wish I could talk to him about it,

but he's like an open sore.

</line>


<line>
Attention! As some of you

might have heard, my mom died recently.

</line>


<line>
I know you're very concerned,

but I wanna let you know

it will not affect my work.

</line>


<line>
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.

I just want to focus on the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
So, please treat this like any other day,

and be extra-nice to me

</line>


<line>
because I am a famous actor,

not because my mom died.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all murmuring]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d.

</line>


<line>
Yes, that's what I'm looking for.

Just go about your business.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's good 'cause I don't want to talk

about my mom.

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-Hey. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you hear my mom died?

-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.

</line>


<line>
No. Pretty weird she died, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, huh?

</line>


<line>
-Do you want to talk about it?

-No. I'm just saying it's weird.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>. I am so sorry.

-And I so don't wanna talk about it.

</line>


<line>
Obsessed with my mom much?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the one with issues.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I feel like he wants me to comfort him,

but I'm still angry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you could both use some space

from each other.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell him you need

to focus on your work?

</line>


<line>
What work?

<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>py won't let me do anything.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[dolphin voice]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>py? Are you okay?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[squeaking]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Hey, what are we filming today?

Why is there a submarine set?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[squeaking continues]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Interior sub?

</line>


<line>
Why didn't you just write "way"?

</line>


<line>
Okay. So, now we just need

to come up with a scene

that takes place in a submarine.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Ah!

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you hear my mom died?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Indira</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> How about this?

If he wants to talk,

and you aren't can't confront him,

tell him your<ital> therapist</ital> says

you need space.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's where I went wrong.

I inserted myself into her story.

</line>


<line>
Don't beat yourself up.

Remember what <name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor <name type="PERSON">Janet</name> said?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[bells in accordance to stick]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me about your day.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had a tough workplace mediation?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>o! <name type="PERSON">T</name>he problem with these two

is they don't just work together.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey also live together.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
What a beautiful morning!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Indira</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.

</line>


<line>
If your story can have Princess <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana,

why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?

</line>


<line>
It's not actually Princess <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana.

She's just named <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana.

</line>


<line>
I've been picturing Princess <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana.

</line>


<line>
Okay, fine. <name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me what happened

with Emperor Finger-Face.

</line>


<line>
He lived in the same apartment

as a <name type="PERSON">T</name>angled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

in the shape of a woman.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d morning, Emperor Finger-Face!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d morning to you,

<name type="PERSON">T</name>angled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!

</line>


<line>
-See you tonight?

-Afternoon.

</line>


<line>
I wanna talk to you,

so I set a meeting through your assistant.

</line>


<line>
-Have you seen my keys?

-Butter tray in the fridge.

</line>


<line>
I think I put them there

during one of my night terrors.

</line>


<line>
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.

I'll just <name type="PERSON">ho</name>twire my car.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, did you eat breakfast?

-No time for meals.

</line>


<line>
I just grab whatever I can,

whenever I can.

</line>


<line>
Hold on.

</line>


<line>
I know you're a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>l on the go,

but even tangled fogs of pulsating

yearning need to eat right.

</line>


<line>
I'll get something on set.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name> swear? [<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rn] Ow! I poked my face!

</line>


<line>
I feel I'm having a hard time

following the story

because of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w weird

you made the characters.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he important thing is that these two

have been living together

for almost a year with virtually no drama.

</line>


<line>
In some ways, it's the most f<name type="ORG">un</name>ctional

relationship either have ever been in!

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.

</line>


<line>
Great! Now, back to the story

of the fog and the hand!

</line>


<line>
-So. What can I do you for?

-I have no workspace on set.

</line>


<line>
I was <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping we could allocate some money

to get me an office.

</line>


<line>
Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork

you need all filled out and ready to go.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-Just needs your signature.

</line>


<line>
-Let me retrieve my pen.

-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rvelous!

</line>


<line>
Yep, I am currently gripping my pen

inside my <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et.

</line>


<line>
Now to just pull it out

and sign this document.

</line>


<line>
Just goes to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

you get what you need

if you pull the right strings.

</line>


<line>
Strings?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps] It was you!

-What was me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last string cheese in the apartment,

I was saving it. And you took it!

</line>


<line>
And now you want me to give you an office?

</line>


<line>
What?! I didn't take your cheese.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh, are we having

a work-related conflict?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his feels like more of a

you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.

</line>


<line>
When I started here,

I signed a contract that said,

all intra-office disputes

must be resolved via mediation,

or failing that, forced arbitration.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
So, then I-- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not eating.

</line>


<line>
I just-- I keep thinking

about <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name> the Zebra.

</line>


<line>
Okay, what happened next with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>?

</line>


<line>
Well, he wanted to get back to work,

but since <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>py had writer's block,

there was nothing for the actors to do.

</line>


<line>
How is there nothing to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot?

</line>


<line>
So, what, I just have to wait aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

and be alone with my t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughts? Gross.

</line>


<line>
When I was on<ital> <name type="PERSON">T</name>he Murder-Stoppers.</ital>

we had to shut down production

because <name type="PERSON">Nick Nolte</name> wouldn't come out

of his trailer.

</line>


<line>
He wasn't even on the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w!

He was in one of our trailers,

</line>


<line>
-and we couldn't get him out!

-Is it hard to write a script, <name type="PERSON">Gino</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, I'm <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>, bang, bang.

I'm a tough guy.

</line>


<line>
My wife is dead! <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I kill her?

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows? I'm cool."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was pretty good.

Can we just roll on that?

</line>


<line>
When there's something to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot,

we'll s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out

in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.

</line>


<line>
Nah, I'd just be thinking about

my dead mom the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time,

which would either ruin it or--

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, what if it makes it better?

I don't wanna know that.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want me to just get you some pie?

-No.

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-Okay, big guy.

</line>

</line>


<line>
-[sympathetic voice] Hey, buddy.

-Hey, Mr. <name type="ORG">C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate-Hazelnut-Spread</name>.

</line>


<line>
Really sorry about your mom.

</line>


<line>
No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.

</line>


<line>
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.

I, for one, never have.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've never lost a loved one?

</line>


<line>
-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.

-What?

</line>


<line>
In the co<name type="ORG">un</name>try, where she could have

plenty of room to r<name type="ORG">un</name> free.

</line>


<line>
Why would she wanna r<name type="ORG">un</name> aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

if she's old?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

I never really questioned the logic.

</line>


<line>
My brother set it up.

I haven't been able to visit,

but everyone in my family

goes to that farm eventually.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.

-What? No. She's at a farm.

</line>


<line>
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.

A farm.

</line>


<line>
Where they don't have telep<name type="PERSON">ho</name>nes,

or the internet, and... Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
She's dead. My mom is dead!

</line>


<line>
-[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
-What's going on with this submarine?

-My therapist doesn't want me

talking to you!

</line>


<line>
-What?

-My therapist, Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>,

says it would be good

if you <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve me some space.

</line>


<line>
-Why would she say that?

-Don't know. I'm just the client.

</line>


<line>
-Her call, not mine. I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Everybody? My dear mother

has transcended this plane.

</line>


<line>
-[all] Aw.

-I am incredibly fragile

and could use all the support I can get,

so if everyone could pay

a lot of attention to me,

and ask me a lot of questions

about my mother,

and maybe tell me stories

about your mothers,

</line>


<line>
I think that would really make me

feel a lot better.

</line>


<line>
Sure, Mr. <name type="ORG">C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate-Hazelnut-Spread</name>!

</line>


<line>
-[man] So sorry for your loss.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a very healthy way to grieve.

</line>


<line>
-[applause]

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
So, a brief recapitulation:

this is not a room

for repudiation or con<name type="NORP">dem</name>nation

over string cheese

appropriation accusations.

</line>


<line>
Mediation is an invitation

for open conversation,

frustration de-escalation,

and exchange of information,

which, in su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ation,

removes any justification for liti<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tion

involving this corporation.

</line>


<line>
Nobody was going to liti<name type="PERSON">ga</name>te anything.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's fabulous,

because you le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>lly cannot.

</line>


<line>
Now, tell me about your journey

into the woods of conflict.

</line>


<line>
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,

</line>


<line>
I was excited to come <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

to some string cheese. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he very last one.

</line>


<line>
I'd been saving it all week.

</line>


<line>
-All week <name type="ORG">un</name>til Wednesday?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is correct.

</line>


<line>
I measure my weeks <name type="PERSON">T</name>hursday to Wednesday.

</line>


<line>
-Why would you--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>angled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?

</line>


<line>
Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.

</line>


<line>
I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> melt it down

and then sculpt it

into a <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>zzarella <name type="PERSON">Cinderella</name>!

</line>


<line>
But when I got <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

my string cheese was gone!

</line>


<line>
Doesn't mean I took it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>angled Fog, watch yourself.

Or I'll turn on this fan.

</line>


<line>
Well, this morning you said yourself

that when it comes to eating,

</line>


<line>
-you just grab whatever you can.

-Can we use "I" statements?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ai, ai, ai! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u took my cheese!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u probably ate it yourself

during one of your night terrors!

</line>


<line>
We know you opened the fridge.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u put my keys in there.

</line>


<line>
I can't eat while I'm terrified.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why I'll never know

the delicious cr<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of Co<name type="ORG">un</name>t C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>cula.

</line>


<line>
-[shudders]

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat still doesn't mean I took it.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u will both have a chance to--

-Come on!

</line>


<line>
We both know you drift aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

the apartment like you own the place.

</line>


<line>
-It's my apartment!

-[s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uts and thumps] And it's my cheese!

</line>


<line>
Oh, boy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[tires screech]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<line>
-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts] W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> do you think you are?

there are named <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>gle filled in your last name for me.

</line>


<line>
Why did you tell <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana

that she needed space from me?

</line>


<line>
Would you like to have a seat?

</line>


<line>
No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"

and here's why.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>herapists are manipulative leeches...

</line>


<line>
So, when <name type="PERSON">Jerry</name> Lewis

mistook me for the valet,

he was carrying so much pain

I could never fat<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m.

</line>


<line>
-Mm...

-And that realization

allows me to forgive.

Not for his sake, but for mine.

</line>


<line>
-Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>. How long was I talking?

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe that was ca<name type="PERSON">thar</name>tic for you.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna come back same time tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.

Are you... my new best friend?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Uh...?

</line>


<line>
Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm <name type="PERSON">ho</name>gging

all the conversation.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's definitely more to your story

than mine.

</line>


<line>
Mine's more like a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ondary story.

A B-story, if you will.

</line>


<line>
I have a feeling it will continue

to offer a light alternative,

as my story gets increasingly serious.

</line>


<line>
Let's continue to switch back and forth

between our stories,

pausing at their most interesting moments.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat feels like the most natural way

to have a conversation.

</line>


<line>
Well, while I was talking to <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana was trying to keep things together

</line>


<line>
-on set.

-I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it was my turn.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps] Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>! Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana] Okay, cut?

</line>


<line>
-[buzzer blares]

-Why is <name type="ORG">Sassy</name> saying <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>?"

</line>


<line>
I just figured,

we've got all these people here,

we might as well film some stuff.

</line>


<line>
Presumably something s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>cking will happen,

and then if it does,

we have a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t of you saying,

[mimics <name type="PERSON">Gino</name>] <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>!"

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>kes sense.

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana</name>, can I talk to you for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>?

</line>


<line>
I know you're going through something,

and need bo<name type="ORG">un</name>daries,

but this isn't personal,

</line>


<line>
-it's about the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

-Ah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts, sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> What is it?

</line>


<line>
I lied. It's a 100% personal.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-But it's good! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> like this.

</line>


<line>
-Remember you said you needed space?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
When you told me that,

I didn't take it well.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-But I made a new friend,

</line>


<line>
-so everything is good now.

-Oh. Well, that's great.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad you think so because, f<name type="ORG">un</name> twist,

</line>


<line>
-it's Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I'm seeing Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name> now, as a friend.

Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>'s my new friend.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-What?

</line>


<line>
It's great that you would wanna talk

to someone, and you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld!

</line>


<line>
But she's mine.

I really need her to just be mine.

</line>


<line>
-Can you <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand that?

-[sighs] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana asked me not to be friends with you,

so out of respect for her,

</line>


<line>
I think it's best that I continue

seeing you behind her back.

</line>


<line>
We can still do our l<name type="ORG">un</name>chtime hang outs,

but to cover our tracks,

</line>


<line>
I'll compensate you

for your time on the books.

</line>


<line>
Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.

</line>


<line>
And, to be safe, we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld invoke

a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.

</line>


<line>
How's that so<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

</line>


<line>
So, in my dreams, I'm <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>,

and sometimes when I wake up,

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I'm <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> or if I'm me,

</line>


<line>
-or if I'm still dreaming.

-[watch beeping]

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's our time of friendship <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur.

</line>


<line>
I'm just so glad that I can help break up

your day of listening to whiny babies

with some entertaining l<name type="ORG">un</name>chtime convo.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld I have told him

what we were doing was therapy?

</line>


<line>
On some level, he must have known

what was going on.

</line>


<line>
What I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand is,

if you knew <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana asked him

not to see you--

</line>


<line>
I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.

A DJ spins.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Chastain takes whatever gig

<name type="PERSON">Amy</name> <name type="PERSON">Adam</name>s says no to.

</line>


<line>
My job is to listen.

</line>


<line>
And at that moment,

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name> needed someone to listen.

</line>


<line>
I know the feeling.

</line>


<line>
Okay, we've been going back and forth

for two <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

</line>


<line>
Can we take a break?

I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe it's just another hand down there!

Guess I'll find out!

</line>


<line>
Why not just say you took the cheese?

</line>


<line>
-Because I didn't.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want an office, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's nothing wrong with telling

a small lie to avoid a fight.

</line>


<line>
I do it all the time with my wife,

<name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor, uh, Underwear.

</line>


<line>
-Heh?

-I love your new hairstyle, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ney.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you not like my new hairstyle?

-Oh! Um... Back to my story...

</line>


<line>
All you have to do

is tell Emperor Finger-Face

what he wants to hear.

</line>


<line>
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string

for a brand-new office?

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't you take that deal?

</line>


<line>
So, turns out I can use the bathroom,

but it comes out in tiny cubes!

</line>


<line>
Hey. I took the string cheese.

</line>


<line>
Ha, ha! I knew it!

</line>


<line>
Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheese

and you'll give her an office. We did it!

</line>


<line>
Great! Let me just grab my pen.

</line>


<line>
-But even if I did take the cheese--

-Which you just admitted you did!

</line>


<line>
Would I be in the wrong?

</line>


<line>
I mean, it is kind of a "fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me food,"

don't you think?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It's not like it's a sandwich.

</line>


<line>
Some foods are just widely <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood

to be up for grabs.

</line>


<line>
-No. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u guys.

-[Finger-Face] Okay.

</line>


<line>
Well, then let's make a list

of fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me foods.

</line>


<line>
Grapes. Fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me. Eggs. Fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me.

An <name type="ORG">un</name>sliced pie. Not fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me.

</line>


<line>
A sliced pie. Fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last slice. Not fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen let's also make a list

of what's fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me to me in my apartment.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's right, everything,

you literal <name type="PERSON">knucklehead</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a solid diss coming from a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s.

</line>


<line>
Please, you two,

we can still reach an agreement.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I think this might go

beyond simple mediation.

</line>


<line>
-No!

-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!

<line>
If it relieves any pressure,

</line>


<line>
I don't know that everyone thinks

you're a brilliant genius.

</line>


<line>
I think we need to simplify.

</line>


<line>
Let's start with <name type="PERSON">Fritz</name>.

Is he a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st or is he not a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st?

</line>


<line>
Can't he just be a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st?

</line>


<line>
So, why is <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> seeing a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st?

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe he feels ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted?

</line>


<line>
And <name type="PERSON">Fritz</name> represents that?

What is ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ting <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's great. But also...

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe something involving a submarine?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u keep thinking.

</line>


<line>
Hey, are we about to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot something?

</line>


<line>
I'm meeting a friend for l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't know her.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a while still.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>py is working through his "process."

And I am helping.

</line>


<line>
So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds good. Just remember,

you are not responsible

for the dysf<name type="ORG">un</name>ction of others.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying don't let him

get you down.

</line>


<line>
Where did you hear that?

About the dysf<name type="ORG">un</name>ction of others?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Just aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

It's a thing people say.

</line>


<line>
Hey, are we <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get new pages today

or what?

</line>


<line>
W-w-wait, did you say "Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn"?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, "<name type="PERSON">Priscilla Crustacean</name>."

</line>


<line>
<ital>Vamanos,</ital> on the pages, okay?

</line>


<line>
I've been here all day today,

Wednesday, October 24th,

waiting for something to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot.

<ital><name type="PERSON">Andele</name>, andele, andele!</ital>

</line>


<line>
I think your <name type="PERSON">Priscilla Crustacean</name>

is the same person

as my <name type="PERSON">T</name>angled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

in the shape of a woman!

</line>


<line>
And if she was on set all day

Wednesday, that means--

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Bu-- Hold</name> on,

I'm getting to the juicy part.

</line>


<line>
As soon as I get the thing,

I don't want it anymore.

</line>


<line>
It feels cheap.

So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.

-Emotionally naked!

-I knew it!

How long has he been your client?

</line>


<line>
-Not a client.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hree--

</line>


<line>
Days. Friends for three days.

</line>


<line>
I asked you not to see her.

</line>


<line>
I asked for one part of my life

that I could have to myself.

</line>


<line>
News flash, you're not the only one

going through shit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe if I could talk to you,

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't need to be looking

for other friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana, is there anything you'd like

to discuss with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>?

</line>


<line>
We can do it right here.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a safe space.

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his doesn't feel

like a safe space anymore.

</line>


<line>
I can't keep coming here

if I know you're also seeing him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen it so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like

our time together is done.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're setting a bo<name type="ORG">un</name>dary.It is good.

</line>


<line>
Go forth with the tools I've given you.

Like a candle in the wind.

</line>


<line>
-I can't believe this is happening.

-I think <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name> needs me more.

</line>


<line>
-Would you like validation?

-No.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Wow, I can't believe you c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>

over your client of seven years.

</line>


<line>
At a certain point,

</line>


<line>
I can't <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld myself responsible

for other people's dysf<name type="ORG">un</name>ction.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that is kind of your job.

</line>


<line>
But at least now you can help

the <name type="ORG">Angsty</name> Zebra, right?

</line>


<line>
Well...

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.

-Real what now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did the hard part,

admitting you need help.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I admit that?

</line>


<line>
And now comes the even harder part,

getting the help.

</line>


<line>
-Let's talk about your mother.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what? <name type="PERSON">T</name>his has been great.

</line>


<line>
I got what I wanted

and I made so much progress!

</line>


<line>
So, I think I'm done?

</line>


<line>
-Yes. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did it!

-I--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u changed my stripes!

Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>, you're great at your job!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye forever.

-W-w-w-wait!

</line>


<line>
I can't believe I lost two clients

in one day.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're focusing on the ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure you helped them

in ways you'll never know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his area's all mine.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is fair <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me. Ya see the line?

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn was on set all day,

the day of the string cheese theft.

</line>


<line>
She was not <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

when the cheese went missing,

rendering any arbitration agreement made

<name type="ORG">un</name>der t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se conditions null and void.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks a lot, <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ry-<name type="PERSON">Beth</name>.

</line>


<line>
Just doing my job, kid.

A doctor heals. A DJ spins.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bryce</name> Dallas Howard takes the gigs,

<name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Chastain says no to.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ry-<name type="PERSON">Beth</name> mediates.

</line>


<line>
So, it so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like

you didn't take my string cheese.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I've been saying!

</line>


<line>
I don't even know why we had to go through

corporate mediation in the first place!

</line>


<line>
I guess I just wanted it to be

a workplace dispute,

because I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught if you knew

it was a roo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ate dispute,

you might kick me out.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> kick you out.

I like having you aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
Oh, really?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> else would I get to keep my keys cold?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I have this job now.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe I could start paying,

I believe it's prono<name type="ORG">un</name>ced "roa<name type="ORG">un</name>nt?"

</line>


<line>
Rent? Well. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a great idea.

</line>


<line>
But I also need my own space.

Which is why I wanted that office.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, let's get you that office.

I just need to grab my pen.

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Hey. I want to apologize...

for my behavior at Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>'s.

</line>


<line>
-Don't worry about it.

-She was right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need her more than I do.

And I think she can really help you.

</line>


<line>
Help with what?

</line>


<line>
I was looking for someone

to hang out with during my l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

</line>


<line>
I didn't want some

psyc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>-babbling quack job

telling me to get in touch

with my feelings.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> needs that?

-I do. I need that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't anymore!

She said it herself, you're fixed!

</line>


<line>
And then after you left, I was like,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, if <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane doesn't need this,

I don't need this."

</line>


<line>
Wait, you quit?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.

I might be too smart.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u haven't changed at all.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, no, no. I'm not the problem here.

</line>


<line>
None of this would have happened

if I felt like I could talk to you,

my friend, after my mother died.

</line>


<line>
So, would you like to talk

about your mother?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm just saying as an example.

</line>


<line>
Why do you bring things back to my mother?

</line>


<line>
I can't keep playing this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u say you wanna get better

and you don't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Well, here's me, your friend,

telling you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w: get therapy.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise, don't waste my time.

</line>


<line>
Uh, you heard Dr. <name type="PERSON">Indira</name>.

She said we don't need her.

</line>


<line>
She said I don't need her!

</line>


<line>
I know, but you're just as screwed up

as I am.

</line>
