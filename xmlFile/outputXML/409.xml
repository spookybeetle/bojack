Class, settle down. Settle down.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>'s turn

to present her ancestor.

</line>


<line>
-Go ahead, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

-Okay, <name type="PERSON">T</name>each-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>t.

</line>


<line>
-Mrs. <name type="PERSON">T</name>each-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>t.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
My great-great-great grandmother

was called Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
She was an agent

and a manager in <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo.

</line>


<line>
What's the difference

between an agent and a manager?

for their clients

but only managers can produce.

</line>


<line>
-[class murmuring]

-What?

</line>


<line>
My mom told me that I come

from a long line of strong female cats.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn was the r<name type="ORG">un</name>t of 12

and it made her one of the toughest.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m said, "She could take a lickin'

and keep on tickin'."

For Ancestry Day, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell you

a particular story

about one particular day

on which Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn faced

all the way back in the year 2017.

Nah, maybe too clever.

I don't want people to think I'm trying.

Sorry, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this?

<line>
-Oh, hey, P.C. So what do you think?

-About what?

</line>

"Go for <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!" Or maybe--

</line>


<line>
Ugh, stop!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get a new agent.

</line>


<line>
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

</line>

Offers? Well, you tell them

that I am not doing another reality s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

But, <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond,

these are actually good offers.

</line>


<line>
-Really? Like what?

-I'm not telling you because--

</line>


<line>
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,

so I'll call you back later. Bye.

<line>
-<ital>Don't call. I don't work for you!</ital>

I still don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand your plan,

or <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w that's a headline.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he plan couldn't be simpler.

Go to the co<name type="ORG">un</name>ty court<name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

ask to see all the birth certificates

on file, find <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck's,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're not just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give you

the birth certificates.

</line>


<line>
Well, I gotta try something.

I have this girl at my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

</line>


<line>
w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> came to me for help,

I want to do right by her.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I am a famous.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey will give me the birth certificate.

</line>


<line>
Everyone gives me everything I want

all the time.

</line>


<line>
It is an existential curse,

but a huge day-to-day convenience.

</line>


<line>
-So why do you need me?

-I don't know. Just wanted some company.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told me to use a vacation day

because this was, quote,

</line>


<line>
"a feminism-related emergency."

-I got your number!

-Why didn't you just bring <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck?

into co<name type="ORG">un</name>ting her teeth this morning,

I couldn't believe

when he said you weren't interested.

<line>
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,

and he does what I say.

<line>
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got to start over as a manager,

and instead of buying <name type="ORG">VIM</name>,

I bought <name type="ORG">the Utah Jazz</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're terrible agents,

but they're getting better.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Anyway, nice bumping into--

</line>


<line>
-Oh, sorry.

-Careful, please. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Char</name>ley] <name type="PERSON">Oop</name>sie. Oh, boy.

-No, no.

</line>


<line>
-[crashes]

-Is that valuable? It is.

</line>


<line>
My great, great, great grandmother

was dismayed that her trusted colleague

had kept this from her.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Her mind raced,</ital>

<ital>"Was <name type="GPE">Judah</name> capable of deception?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ped what <name type="PERSON">Char</name>ley told her</ital>

<ital>wasn't true,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but her instincts told her</ital>

<ital>the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</ital>

</line>


<line>
First quarter, <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond quarter.

Wow, that's a lot of quarters.

</line>


<line>
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>, you'll never guess

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I just ran into.

</line>


<line>
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
-It was <name type="PERSON">Char</name>ley <name type="PERSON">Witherspoon</name>!

-Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Char</name>... ley...

<line>
-Wither... spoon!

-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-How does that make you feel?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat very s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt story

makes me feel nothing.

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's your fault

as a storyteller.

</line>


<line>
I often have trouble en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ging

with narratives.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>His lack of response</ital>

<ital>made her <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe it wasn't true.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Could it all have been a mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstanding</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>involving an enigmatic stranger</ital>

<ital>named "<name type="PERSON">Judo</name>"?</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, what's next, then?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I want to get the life rights

to that woman I saw on <name type="ORG">Instagram</name>

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> had a pretty coffee.

</line>


<line>
I bet we could attach <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Alba

and <name type="PERSON">Jonathan</name> <name type="PERSON">T</name>aylor-<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>mas by l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but I still don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

what a manager <ital>is.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do they just say the names

of movies and actors?

</line>


<line>
How does that generate revenue?

</line>


<line>
No one knows, <name type="PERSON">T</name>orf. It's not important!

</line>


<line>
Be quiet, <name type="PERSON">T</name>orf. <name type="PERSON">T</name>ake your <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>sh Pill.

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="PERSON">T</name>each--

[gulps]

</line>


<line>
Uh-hh...

</line>


<line>
-Continue your presentation, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
-And finally, Rob <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>we.

-Great idea, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
But is it possible you've forgotten

your doctor's appointment?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, fish!

-It's my fault.

</line>


<line>
I rescheduled it in an attempt

to make your life easier.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>! I'll call you

if I think of any more actor names.

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">God</name></name>, this is taking forever.

-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

</line>


<line>
I know. Let's just go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

How could you even suggest that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not about us.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is for my daughter.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh.

-I know what I have to do.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a, a famous guy!

-And he's doing the right thing?

-Wait. Don't you mean <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name> <name type="PERSON">Clooners</name>?

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> cares?

-<name type="ORG">Nu</name>mber?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, I don't give out

my personal p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne number.

</line>


<line>
No, your number. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need a number

or I can't help you, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> Hor.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Horse</name>man. It's <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

I don't look familiar to you at all?

</line>


<line>
-Eh.

-Come on, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>. Let's get a number.

<line>
Wait a minute. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane <name type="PERSON">Nguyen</name>!

</line>


<line>
I recognize you

from your <ital><name type="PERSON">Girl Croosh</name> </ital>avatar.

</line>


<line>
I loved "<name type="PERSON">T</name>wenty Reasons

to <name type="PERSON">T</name>ry the <name type="PERSON">Di</name>va Cup."

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow, thanks! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't think

20 was too many reasons?

</line>


<line>
-No way. <name type="ORG">Nu</name>mber 14 blew my mind!

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>dn't I say it would?

</line>


<line>
We don't have time.

Where do we get a number?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat line.

-What?

</line>


<line>
And you'll need these-- [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

forms.

</line>


<line>
Ow, paper cut! W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> still uses paper?

</line>


<line>
Can't I just swipe an app or something?

</line>

-Bye, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane! Keep up the great work!

</line>


<line>
Oh, get over yourself.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
-So? What's the prognosis?

-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to think of the best way

to put this.

</line>


<line>
As <name type="PERSON">Char</name>les Lindbergh would say,

</line>


<line>
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,

and sometimes you lose a baby."

</line>


<line>
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.

</line>


<line>
Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur pregnancy is no longer viable.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do we make it viable a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

</line>


<line>
Mm-<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
How did this happen?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dness, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't beat yourself up.

Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's nothing medically wrong with you.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you just wanted the baby too much.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you didn't deserve it

because you were <name type="ORG">un</name>kind once.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you ran afoul of a trickster god

or wood nymph w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is now exacting revenge.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is... a lot.

</line>


<line>
Not for me. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is my job,

so... pretty regular day.

</line>


<line>
What do I do next?

</line>


<line>
Well, there's a procedure.

We can do it here later this week.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want <name type="PERSON">Darlene</name> to call someone

to drive you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a real tough broad.

Except for, you know, the uterus area.

</line>


<line>
Pretty weak.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, is my necklace ready?

-Oh, I was going to call you.

</line>


<line>
When I was working on your necklace,

I realized something.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-It's not actually gold,

it's just gold plated. See?

</line>


<line>
No, it's very expensive.

</line>


<line>
It's pretty, but basically worthless.

</line>


<line>
And I'm only saying it's pretty

to make you feel better.

</line>


<line>
But, it's from the old co<name type="ORG">un</name>try.

It's been in my family for generations.

</line>


<line>
No, this is costume jewelry

from J.C. <name type="ORG">Penn</name>ey.

</line>


<line>
Circa 1963.

Somebody just told you a story.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-Wha-- huh?

</line>


<line>
So, do you still want a 24-karat gold

clasp on this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rbage necklace, or...?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sniffles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Oh-hh!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>, hey!

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ney. Just checking

on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w the doctor's appointment went

and also to wish you a happy

"Acknowledge <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur Gardener Day."

</line>


<line>
It's a work in progress. Don't judge.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he doctor's appointment got pushed back.

</line>


<line>
I'm actually just walking in now.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

here for my appointment.

</line>


<line>
I like your perfume.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here is a painting of a lake on the wall.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure it's okay I'm not there with you?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>, it's fine. I'm a big girl.

</line>


<line>
Everything is so easy with you,

Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's why I love you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, easy. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what the boys in high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol

liked about me, too.

Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.

Do you need anything else before I go?

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld you be drinking that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't always know

what's best for me, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
Is everything okay, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Char</name>ley <name type="PERSON">Witherspoon</name>

made you an offer to buy <name type="PERSON">Vim</name>,

and you went over my head

and turned him down wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut telling me.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-So it's true. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u lied to me.

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Because you didn't want to work

at a big agency.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't fit in with other people.

-I--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're weird, so you'd rather stay here

where you have all the power.

</line>


<line>
No, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn--

</line>


<line>
So you lied to me,

and you made me look like an idiot!

</line>


<line>
I was trying to protect you. If you heard,

you'd feel like you had to say yes.

</line>


<line>
I don't need you to protect me.

</line>


<line>
If you had time, you could decide

what to do next

on your own terms, which you did.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's not your decision to make.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand you're upset.

</line>


<line>
-And perhaps your emotions--

-No.

</line>


<line>
If I can't trust you,

then I can't work with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're fired.

</line>

Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
It's been very pleasurable. Until now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his part is... sad.

</line>


<line>
Don't forget,

you have reservations at 8:00.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>, this story has gotten really dark.

</line>


<line>
It has a happy ending. I promise.

</line>


<line>
Well, can we get there soon?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his assignment

was supposed to be six beans long.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've already gone on for eight beans.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm almost finished.

</line>


<line>
But first, let's check in

with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
What have they been up to?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[beeping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Error. Error.

</line>


<line>
I'm not leaving

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut the certificate!

</line>


<line>
I danced your dance, lady.

I filled out that form.

</line>


<line>
But I will not wait in this line anymore.

</line>


<line>
Not one person in here

offered me a <name type="NORP">Fiji</name> water,

and I am parched

from all the yelling I've been doing!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, let's go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
No, I would like to register

a formal complaint.

</line>


<line>
-How do I do that?

-Complaints are on the eighth floor.

</line>


<line>
But you need to fill out an application

for a complaint registration,

which you can get by waiting

in line 12-B on the third floor.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have won this ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
So Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn had to meet <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>But she didn't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to tell him</ital>

<ital>what had happened</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>or <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w he'd take the news.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so, what do you think

about "National Paperweight Day"?

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for keeping my papers in place.

I love you as big as outer space."

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you'd give that card

to a paperweight?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ah, Principessa! And Signor </ital><name type="PERSON">Stilton</name>.

Welcome-a back.

</line>


<line>
Let's have a drink then, yes?

</line>


<line>
I'll have a glass

of <name type="ORG">Châtea<name type="ORG">un</name>euf-du-Pape</name>,

the red wine inspired by <ital>Scandal.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat <name type="PERSON">Kerry</name> <name type="GPE">Washington</name> has really brought

red wine into popularity.

</line>


<line>
It's a-f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny,

because I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught that the <ital>terroir</ital>

of the <name type="NORP">Italian</name> co<name type="ORG">un</name>tryside did it.

</line>


<line>
-But, a-no, it's-a <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="PERSON">Kerry</name> <name type="GPE">Washington</name>.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

would love some mint tea. Right?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know it.

<ital>-Bene, bene.</ital>

</line>


<line>
How was the doctor?

He tell you the species?

</line>


<line>
I can't stop thinking about squeezing

little <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>'s baby feet.

</line>


<line>
-Aw-ww...

-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>] <ital>She wanted to tell him.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But she also wanted to let him stay</ital>

<ital>in his beautiful <name type="PERSON">ho</name>peful reality,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>a reality she herself had lived in</ital>

<ital>just <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs before,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and to which she now longed</ital>

<ital>desperately to return.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w doctors are. But he did say

there's nothing wrong with me, so--

</line>

-Ooh!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't come <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me, didn't answer

your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne. I was worried.

</line>


<line>
Aw, you was worried?

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name> told me you might be here.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you fire him?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat hipster <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name>,

always getting in my personal biz-natch.

<line>
I didn't know you still had this place.

Why do you still have this place?

</line>


<line>
Okay, what? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hird degree much?

</line>


<line>
-Have you been drinking?

-It's fine, okay?

</line>


<line>
-I get to drink because baby went gone!

-What?

</line>


<line>
"Gone, baby, gone."

Like that Ben <name type="PERSON">Affleck</name> movie.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat could be a sequel.

<ital>Gone, Baby, Never Was. </ital>Write that down.

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

-It's okay! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know me.

</line>


<line>
I always land on my feet.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake a lickin', keep tickin'.

</line>


<line>
Like a lollipop with <name type="PERSON">T</name>ourette's.

Write that down.

</line>


<line>
So you were lying earlier at dinner?

</line>


<line>
Is that what you're upset about?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat I lied?

</line>


<line>
About losing the baby?

About keeping my apartment?

</line>


<line>
I lied? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the big sad thing

that happened?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rying to process

what you threw at me.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be fine.

I'll be pregnant a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in in no time.

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry. Let me take you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
-When you're ready to try a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in--

-I'm ready!

</line>


<line>
I said I was ready.

</line>


<line>
So we'll go back to the doctor,

maybe talk about other options.

</line>


<line>
I don't need other options.

My mother had 12 kids.

</line>


<line>
My body was made for this.

We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.

</line>


<line>
I know you wanna do this on your own,

but you've had two miscarriages now, and--

</line>


<line>
-Five!

-What?

</line>


<line>
I've had five miscarriages.

</line>


<line>
One last year, now one,

and three others before.

</line>


<line>
-But it's whatever. It's okay.

-Why didn't you tell me?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

I don't want you looking at me like that.

</line>


<line>
Like that! I know I can do this.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't keep stuff like this from me.

It's not okay.

</line>


<line>
-It's not about you.

-It is. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is about us.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not allowed to be mad at me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is my bad day.

-It's our bad day.

</line>


<line>
It's so easy for you...

to love me when everything's good.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, I...

</line>


<line>
-Let me take you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

-No.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to live in this.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get used to this,

because if you're serious about having

a baby with me, this could happen a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Are you prepared for that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his could happen five more times.

But I'm ready for that.

</line>


<line>
Because I want this.

Do you want it that bad?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I just think we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld

maybe talk about other options.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Here's another option.

</line>


<line>
-Get out of my apartment!

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one you can take <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me to your parents.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <ital>easy.</ital>

<line>
-[beeps]

-What is it?

</line>


<line>
I'm calling about the offers.

I don't want to do 'em.

</line>


<line>
What's the point of being famous

if you wait in line?

</line>


<line>
<ital>If you could politely decline</ital>

<ital>on my behalf--</ital>

</line>


<line>
I do not work for you, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I started this all wrong.

How was your day?

</line>


<line>
-[moans] Well--

-<ital>Because mine was awful.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I mean, truly, one for the books.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Because I'm a good guy

trying to do the right thing.

</line>


<line>
First, I go for my breakfast <name type="ORG">Pinkberry</name>,

which I had earned

because I had good intentions for today,

they're out of my favorite toppings!

</line>


<line>
<ital>So I go across the street to Menchie's,</ital>

<ital>like some kind of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>bo.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
At Menchie's, the stupid teen that

worked there raised her eyebrows at me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name> kidding me?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're trying to judge me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have very <name type="ORG">un</name>even eyebrows

and you work at a Menchie's."

</line>


<line>
<ital>And don't even get me started</ital>

<ital>on the rancid internment camp</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that is the L.A. Co<name type="ORG">un</name>ty <name type="ORG">Court</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, you wanna know what I do

when I have a really bad,

awful, terrible day?

</line>


<line>
<ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I imagine my great-great-great

granddaughter in the future

talking to her class about me.

</line>


<line>
She's poised and f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny,

and tells people about me

and <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w everything worked out

in the end.

</line>


<line>
And when I think about that,

</line>


<line>
I think about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w everything's

going to work out.

</line>


<line>
Because <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w else could she tell people?

</line>


<line>
But it's... fake.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well... it makes me feel better.
