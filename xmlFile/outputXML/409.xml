<line>
Class, settle down. Settle down.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>'s turn

to present her ancestor.

</line>


<line>
-Go ahead, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

-Okay, Teach-Bot.

</line>


<line>
-Mrs. Teach-Bot.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
My great-great-great grandmother

was called Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
She was an agent

and a manager in Hollywoo.

</line>


<line>
What's the difference

between an agent and a manager?

</line>


<line>
Both look to find projects

for their clients

but only managers can produce.

</line>


<line>
-[class murmuring]

-What?

</line>


<line>
My mom told me that I come

from a long line of strong female cats.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12

and it made her one of the toughest.

</line>


<line>
Mom said, "She could take a lickin'

and keep on tickin'."

</line>


<line>
This expression refers to clocks,

an old fashioned way of timekeeping

</line>


<line>
before we all universally accepted

the bean system.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[class]</nonVerbComm>

"The bean system is the way."

</line>


<line>
For Ancestry Day, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell you

a particular story

about one particular day

on which Princess Carolyn faced

and overcame particular adversity

all the way back in the year 2017.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>] <ital>The day began like any other.</ital>

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Princess Carolyn lived</ital>

<ital>with her boyfriend, <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>She was pregnant and very happy.</ital>

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Sorry I can't go with you

to the doctor.

</line>


<line>
-Don't worry about it. I feel great!

-Today is crucial.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Stilton</name> Cards has to create

its own holiday

to really be playing with the big boys.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Hallmark</name>, American Greeting,

those chunky cards that play music

when you open them.

</line>


<line>
I just know you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

the next Joey K. Easter,

the guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> invented Arbor Day.

</line>


<line>
How about

"National Friend of a Friend Day?"

</line>


<line>
-Is that anything?

-You'll think of something.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps]</nonVerbComm>

Mm!

</line>


<line>
Give me just a sip of the coffee.

I can have a sip.

</line>


<line>
-One sip.

-Today is going to be great.

</line>


<line>
Oh--!

[yelps]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-[moans] Oh-hh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>She was wrong.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Today was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> suck.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Princess Carolyn started her day</ital>

<ital>with a call to <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>her former client-slash-lover.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>! Inappropriate!

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Go for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
You like that?

I'm trying out some new phone stuff.

</line>


<line>
Or is "Bo for GoJack" better?

Nah, maybe too clever.

</line>


<line>
I don't want people to think I'm trying.

Sorry, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, moron.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, hey, <name type="PERSON">P.C.</name> So what do you think?

-About what?

</line>


<line>
"Go for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!" Or maybe--

</line>


<line>
Ugh, stop!

You need to get a new agent.

</line>


<line>
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

</line>


<line>
Offers? Well, you tell them

that I am not doing another reality show.

</line>


<line>
So degrading.

</line>


<line>
All they had at craft services

was <name type="ORG">Kirkland</name> snacks, <name type="PERSON">P.C.</name> <ital><name type="ORG">Kirkland</name> snacks.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, first of all, I don't work for you,

so I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell anyone anything.

</line>


<line>
But, second,

these are actually good offers.

</line>


<line>
-Really? Like what?

-I'm not telling you because--

</line>


<line>
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,

so I'll call you back later. Bye.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Don't call. I don't work for you!</ital>

-How's this for a headline for the blog?

</line>


<line>
You write about this, quote,

"<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> Finally Solves Mystery

</line>


<line>
of <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>hock's Mother,

comma, Looks Handsome,

</line>


<line>
colon: Is Cool." End quote.

</line>


<line>
I still don't understand your plan,

or how that's a headline.

</line>


<line>
The plan couldn't be simpler.

Go to the county courthouse,

ask to see all the birth certificates

on file, find <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>hock's,

see what it says in the "mother" spot.

</line>


<line>
They're not just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give you

the birth certificates.

</line>


<line>
Well, I gotta try something.

I have this girl at my house

</line>


<line>
w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> came to me for help,

I want to do right by her.

</line>


<line>
I just don't know

if you've thought through--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, I am a famous.

They will give me the birth certificate.

</line>


<line>
Everyone gives me everything I want

all the time.

</line>


<line>
It is an existential curse,

but a huge day-to-day convenience.

</line>


<line>
-So why do you need me?

-I don't know. Just wanted some company.

</line>


<line>
You told me to use a vacation day

because this was, quote,

</line>


<line>
"a feminism-related emergency."

</line>


<line>
-I got your number!

-Why didn't you just bring <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>hock?

</line>


<line>
I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>, but she got really

into counting her teeth this morning,

</line>


<line>
didn't want to leave the house.

You know how teens are.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>, this was supposed to be

about your ancestor.

</line>


<line>
-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are all these other "chara-ca-ters"?

-They fill out the world.

</line>


<line>
Well, can you try

to keep things focused, please?

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Princess Carolyn had been</ital>

<ital>called to <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>-<name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name>--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>the agency of her nemesis,</ital>

<ital>and nemesis-slash-former lover.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>!

-Sorry, Teach-Bot.

</line>


<line>
She had a lot of former lovers.

</line>


<line>
She was a fluid sexual being,

not a machine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>But today was all about business.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She was there because she was trying</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>to get her client</ital>

<ital>Courtney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name> cast in--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Corpse Me If You Can-Can</ital>, the 1940's

<name type="GPE">Cannes</name>, <name type="GPE">France</name>-set story

of a can-can dancer w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> contracts cancer

but continues to can-can

as a canny cadaver

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> plays the accordion

with <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> Corrigan, <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> Kline,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Chris Klein</name>, <name type="PERSON">Chris Pine</name> and <name type="PERSON">Chris Kattan</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Got it.

-[gasps] <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.

</line>


<line>
Is it new, or something I've seen you wear

literally hundreds of times?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Normally, Princess Carolyn</ital>

<ital>would've been rattled,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but that day, she realized <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name></ital>

<ital>no longer had any power over her.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>In truth, the woman had challenged</ital>

<ital>and inspired Princess Carolyn,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>not only to be a better agent,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but to be brave enough</ital>

<ital>to try and have it all.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her</ital>

<ital>thank you, but instead she said...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-You look tired, "<name type="PERSON">Veronica</name>."

-Oh, I--

</line>


<line>
Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Princess. We have a little snag.

</line>


<line>
Did <name type="PERSON">Chris Kattan</name> drop out?

Right before his comeback?

</line>


<line>
Right when the world is finally ready

to settle for Kattan?

</line>


<line>
-No, it's--

-You're fired.

</line>


<line>
I'm <ital>fired?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I tried to talk her out of it,

but between the g<name type="ORG">un</name> movie misfiring

and her nuptials

turning into "nope-tials,"

and her blaming you

for both of those things...

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knew <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name> had so many complaints?

Oh, just give me one more chance.

</line>


<line>
I promise I can get you the lead

in that can-can cadaver movie.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> What?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">P.C.</name>, <name type="PERSON">C.P.</name> just made

that whole thing up to get you here.

</line>


<line>
You thought that was real?

</line>


<line>
The 1940's corpse w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> learns accordion?

It sounds so ludicrous.

</line>


<line>
You did play the short-sighted seamstress

in <ital>The Storm on Northern Fortress.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, yeah, but that was just because

I wanted to work with <name type="PERSON">Ashton</name>.

</line>


<line>
We'll talk later, right?

I'm so sorry. Bye.

</line>


<line>
Did you have a good meeting?

[mockingly] Did you get fired?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Aw.

</line>


<line>
Sorry you got fired. Here's a latte.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh--

</line>


<line>
-It's decaf, ma'am.

-Thanks, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
You know, one year ago,

a setback like this

would have really sp<name type="ORG">un</name> me out.

</line>


<line>
But I don't need Courtney.

</line>


<line>
Every time we fall, we get back up

stronger and better than ever.

</line>


<line>
-Can I get a hallelujah?

-Is that a sort of pressed juice?

</line>


<line>
I'll have one hallelujah

on your desk by 12:45.

</line>


<line>
Great. What's next?

</line>


<line>
I noticed your necklace was broken,

so I pushed back your appointment,

and found a reputable jeweler nearby.

</line>


<line>
Don't know what I'd do without you,

my hairy number two!

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm sorry.

That came out horribly.

</line>


<line>
Not to speak above my station,

but perhaps it would behoove us to entice

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name> back into our stable.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-I'm sorry, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
"Stable" and "behoove"

were poor word choices.

</line>


<line>
I was not trying to engage in <name type="ORG">punnery</name>

during business hours,

but we've received 15 more inquiries

about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> just this morning,

and I don't think it's wise to look

a gift... opportunity in the mouth.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is off the table.

We're a small management company.

</line>


<line>
We just need to focus

on the clients we have.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="GPE">Judah</name>]</nonVerbComm> You know best.

-Mo for Gister Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
Hey, handsome. Heard you dropped out

of the governor's race.

</line>


<line>
Now let's get you back to work

on what really matters-- show business!

</line>


<line>
-I'm going to stop you right there.

-I was done.

</line>


<line>
Can't wait to get back

in front of the camera,

but right now, I have to help my former

political rival defeat my two ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
One of whom is in the pocket

of powerful lobbyists

and the other of whom

murdered popular actor

and soundtrack artisan, <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>,

and ate his burnt flesh!

</line>


<line>
Politics as usual, right?

</line>


<line>
Well, when you're ready to work again--

</line>


<line>
Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,

because <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>

lost his hands underground

and they replaced them

with creepy lobster claws.

</line>


<line>
Typical politics!

</line>


<line>
Hey. So I need this clasp replaced,

24-karat gold.

</line>


<line>
This is a priceless family heirloom.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn had gotten her necklace

from her mother,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> got it from <ital>her </ital>mother,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> brought it from the old country.

</line>


<line>
<ital>When our ancestors first emigrated</ital>

<ital>to <name type="GPE">America</name>, they were very poor.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Back in the Motherland,</ital>

<ital>they had been doctors and engineers,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but here, they struggled to find work.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Every night, they would sing the song</ital>

<ital>of the old country,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>hoping to reclaim the glory of those days.</ital>

<ital>because that was the one gift</ital>

<ital>she could give her daughter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>A treasure from the past</ital>

<ital>and a symbol of the tenacity</ital>

that has for generations led my family

to always land on their feet.

</line>


<line>
-You can come back in about two hours.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-[clatters]

-Sorry, sorry! Wait. Sorry, sorry.

</line>


<line>
-[clatters]

-Okay, okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm just looking

for something really nice.

</line>


<line>
This is for a sexy catfish

I met on the Internet.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Charley</name>?

-Princess Carolyn!

</line>


<line>
-You work at a jewelry store now?

-No, I own my own management company.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. Good for you.

</line>


<line>
I'm so proud of you.

</line>


<line>
Your approval means nothing to me.

</line>


<line>
So I guess it's good you said "no"

to my offer last year.

</line>


<line>
What offer? I mean, exactly what offer

are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
I get so many.

</line>


<line>
Last year, I reached out to your guy...

I wanna say, "Ju-do"...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

-This guy's name was <name type="PERSON">Judo</name>.

</line>


<line>
I offered to buy <name type="ORG">VIM</name>

and merge it with <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name>.

</line>


<line>
We would have called

the new company, VIMgor.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. That offer.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't believe

when he said you weren't interested.

</line>


<line>
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,

and he does what I say.

</line>


<line>
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.

</line>


<line>
You got to start over as a manager,

and instead of buying <name type="ORG">VIM</name>,

I bought <name type="ORG">the Utah Jazz</name>.

</line>


<line>
They're terrible agents,

but they're getting better.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Anyway, nice bumping into--

</line>


<line>
-Oh, sorry.

-Careful, please. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Charley</name>] Oopsie. Oh, boy.

-No, no.

</line>


<line>
-[crashes]

-Is that valuable? It is.

</line>


<line>
My great, great, great grandmother

was dismayed that her trusted colleague

had kept this from her.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Her mind raced,</ital>

<ital>"Was <name type="GPE">Judah</name> capable of deception?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She hoped what <name type="PERSON">Charley</name> told her</ital>

<ital>wasn't true,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but her instincts told her</ital>

<ital>the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</ital>

</line>


<line>
First quarter, second quarter.

Wow, that's a lot of quarters.

</line>


<line>
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>, you'll never guess

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I just ran into.

</line>


<line>
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
-It was <name type="PERSON">Charley</name> <name type="PERSON">Witherspoon</name>!

-Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
-Char... ley...

-Hmm...? Hmm!

</line>


<line>
-Wither... spoon!

-Hmm.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-How does that make you feel?

</line>


<line>
That very short story

makes me feel nothing.

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's your fault

as a storyteller.

</line>


<line>
I often have trouble engaging

with narratives.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>His lack of response</ital>

<ital>made her hope it wasn't true.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Could it all have been a mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstanding</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>involving an enigmatic stranger</ital>

<ital>named "<name type="PERSON">Judo</name>"?</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, what's next, then?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I want to get the life rights

to that woman I saw on <name type="ORG">Instagram</name>

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> had a pretty coffee.

</line>


<line>
I bet we could attach <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Alba

and <name type="PERSON">Jonathan</name> Taylor-<name type="PERSON">T</name>homas by lunch.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but I still don't understand

what a manager <ital>is.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do they just say the names

of movies and actors?

</line>


<line>
How does that generate revenue?

</line>


<line>
No one knows, Torf. It's not important!

</line>


<line>
Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> Teach--

[gulps]

</line>


<line>
Uh-hh...

</line>


<line>
-Continue your presentation, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-And finally, Rob Lowe.

-Great idea, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
But is it possible you've forgotten

your doctor's appointment?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, fish!

-It's my fault.

</line>


<line>
I rescheduled it in an attempt

to make your life easier.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>! I'll call you

if I think of any more actor names.

-<name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is taking forever.

-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

</line>


<line>
I know. Let's just go home.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

How could you even suggest that?

</line>


<line>
This is not about us.

This is for my daughter.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh.

-I know what I have to do.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

</line>


<line>
Important celebrity doing the right thing.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa, a famous guy!

-And he's doing the right thing?

</line>


<line>
This is like when <name type="PERSON">George Clooney</name>

married that less famous lady!

</line>


<line>
-Wait. Don't you mean <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name> <name type="PERSON">Clooners</name>?

-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares?

<line>
No, your number. You need a number

or I can't help you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> Hor.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>. It's <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

I don't look familiar to you at all?

</line>


<line>
-Eh.

-Come on, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. Let's get a number.

</line>


<line>
Wait a minute. You're <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> <name type="PERSON">Nguyen</name>!

</line>


<line>
I recognize you

from your <ital><name type="PERSON">Girl Croosh</name> </ital>avatar.

</line>


<line>
I loved "Twenty Reasons

to Try the Diva Cup."

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think

20 was too many reasons?

</line>


<line>
-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!

-Didn't I say it would?

</line>


<line>
We don't have time.

Where do we get a number?

</line>


<line>
-That line.

-What?

</line>


<line>
And you'll need these-- [grunts]

forms.

</line>


<line>
Ow, paper cut! W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> still uses paper?

</line>


<line>
Can't I just swipe an app or something?

</line>


<line>
-Bye, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>! Keep up the great work!

-[giggles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, get over yourself.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
-So? What's the prognosis?

-Hmm...

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to think of the best way

to put this.

</line>


<line>
As <name type="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</name> would say,

</line>


<line>
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,

and sometimes you lose a baby."

</line>


<line>
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.

</line>


<line>
Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.

</line>


<line>
Well, how do we make it viable again?

</line>


<line>
Mm-mm...

</line>


<line>
How did this happen?

</line>


<line>
Goodness, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't beat yourself up.

Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.

</line>


<line>
There's nothing medically wrong with you.

Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you didn't deserve it

because you were unkind once.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster god

or wood nymph w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is now exacting revenge.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>!

This is... a lot.

</line>


<line>
Not for me. This is my job,

so... pretty regular day.

</line>


<line>
What do I do next?

</line>


<line>
Well, there's a procedure.

We can do it here later this week.

</line>


<line>
You want <name type="PERSON">Darlene</name> to call someone

to drive you home?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.

</line>


<line>
You're a real tough broad.

Except for, you know, the uterus area.

</line>


<line>
Pretty weak.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, is my necklace ready?

-Oh, I was going to call you.

</line>


<line>
When I was working on your necklace,

I realized something.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-It's not actually gold,

it's just gold plated. See?

</line>


<line>
No, it's very expensive.

</line>


<line>
It's pretty, but basically worthless.

</line>


<line>
And I'm only saying it's pretty

to make you feel better.

</line>


<line>
But, it's from the old country.

It's been in my family for generations.

</line>


<line>
No, this is costume jewelry

from <name type="ORG">J.C. Penney</name>.

</line>


<line>
Circa 1963.

Somebody just told you a story.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-Wha-- huh?

</line>


<line>
So, do you still want a 24-karat gold

clasp on this garbage necklace, or...?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffles]</nonVerbComm> Oh-hh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps, sobs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[ringtone plays]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>, hey!

</line>


<line>
Hi, honey. Just checking

on how the doctor's appointment went

and also to wish you a happy

"Acknowledge Your Gardener Day."

</line>


<line>
It's a work in progress. Don't judge.

</line>


<line>
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.

</line>


<line>
I'm actually just walking in now.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn,

here for my appointment.

</line>


<line>
I like your perfume.

</line>


<line>
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.

</line>


<line>
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>, it's fine. I'm a big girl.

</line>


<line>
Everything is so easy with you,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's why I love you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, easy. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
That's what the boys in high school

liked about me, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

Okay, I'll see you tonight.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>I love you.</ital>

-I love you, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps, moans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.

Do you need anything else before I go?

</line>


<line>
No. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Should you be drinking that?

</line>


<line>
You don't always know

what's best for me, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Charley</name> <name type="PERSON">Witherspoon</name>

made you an offer to buy <name type="PERSON">Vim</name>,

and you went over my head

and turned him down without telling me.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-So it's true. You lied to me.

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Because you didn't want to work

at a big agency.

</line>


<line>
-You don't fit in with other people.

-I--

</line>


<line>
You're weird, so you'd rather stay here

where you have all the power.

</line>


<line>
No, Princess Carolyn--

</line>


<line>
So you lied to me,

and you made me look like an idiot!

</line>


<line>
I was trying to protect you. If you heard,

you'd feel like you had to say yes.

</line>


<line>
I don't need you to protect me.

</line>


<line>
If you had time, you could decide

what to do next

on your own terms, which you did.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's not your decision to make.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

I understand you're upset.

</line>


<line>
-And perhaps your emotions--

-No.

</line>


<line>
If I can't trust you,

then I can't work with you.

</line>


<line>
You're fired.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you for my time here,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
It's been very pleasurable. Until now.

</line>


<line>
This part is... sad.

</line>


<line>
Don't forget,

you have reservations at 8:00.

</line>


<line>
-Thank you, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

-Good night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>, this story has gotten really dark.

</line>


<line>
It has a happy ending. I promise.

</line>


<line>
Well, can we get there soon?

</line>


<line>
This assignment

was supposed to be six beans long.

</line>


<line>
You've already gone on for eight beans.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm almost finished.

</line>


<line>
But first, let's check in

with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> again.

</line>


<line>
What have they been up to?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeping]</nonVerbComm>

Error. Error.

</line>


<line>
I'm not leaving

without the certificate!

</line>


<line>
I danced your dance, lady.

I filled out that form.

</line>


<line>
But I will not wait in this line anymore.

</line>


<line>
Not one person in here

offered me a <name type="NORP">Fiji</name> water,

and I am parched

from all the yelling I've been doing!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, let's go home.

</line>


<line>
No, I would like to register

a formal complaint.

</line>


<line>
-How do I do that?

-Complaints are on the eighth floor.

</line>


<line>
But you need to fill out an application

for a complaint registration,

which you can get by waiting

in line 12-B on the third floor.

</line>


<line>
You have won this round.

</line>


<line>
So Princess Carolyn had to meet <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>But she didn't know how to tell him</ital>

<ital>what had happened</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>or how he'd take the news.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so, what do you think

about "National Paperweight Day"?

</line>


<line>
"Thanks for keeping my papers in place.

I love you as big as outer space."

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you'd give that card

to a paperweight?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ah, Principessa! And Signor </ital><name type="PERSON">Stilton</name>.

Welcome-a back.

</line>


<line>
Let's have a drink then, yes?

</line>


<line>
I'll have a glass

of <name type="ORG">Châteauneuf-du-Pape</name>,

the red wine inspired by <ital>Scandal.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That <name type="PERSON">Kerry</name> <name type="GPE">Washington</name> has really brought

red wine into popularity.

</line>


<line>
It's a-funny,

because I thought that the <ital>terroir</ital>

of the <name type="NORP">Italian</name> countryside did it.

</line>


<line>
-But, a-no, it's-a <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="PERSON">Kerry</name> <name type="GPE">Washington</name>.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Everybody love-a <name type="PERSON">Miss</name>-a <name type="PERSON">Kerry</name>.

</line>


<line>
And my gal pal here

would love some mint tea. Right?

</line>


<line>
-You know it.

<ital>-Bene, bene.</ital>

</line>


<line>
How was the doctor?

He tell you the species?

</line>


<line>
I can't stop thinking about squeezing

little <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>'s baby feet.

</line>


<line>
-Aw-ww...

-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>] <ital>She wanted to tell him.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But she also wanted to let him stay</ital>

<ital>in his beautiful hopeful reality,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>a reality she herself had lived in</ital>

<ital>just hours before,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and to which she now longed</ital>

<ital>desperately to return.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.

</line>


<line>
You know how doctors are. But he did say

there's nothing wrong with me, so--

</line>


<line>
-Ah, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name>-a <name type="PERSON">Carrie</name> Underwood.

-Ooh!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Miss</name>-a <name type="ORG">Carey</name> Mulligan.

-Agh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Miss</name>-a <name type="ORG">Carey</name>, first name Mariah,

right this-a way!

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-Look at all of these <name type="PERSON">Miss</name>-a-Carries!

</line>


<line>
-[coughing]

-Are you okay?

</line>


<line>
-I have to go.

-Oh. Well, you want me to drive you?

</line>


<line>
No, it's fine.

I'll just meet you at home.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>But when Princess Carolyn</ital>

<ital>got to the home that she and <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name> shared,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>she found she didn't have the strength</ital>

<ital>to go inside.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She wanted to go some place familiar,</ital>

<ital>some place that was just hers.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[yelps]</nonVerbComm> Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whirring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Shh!

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
What is going on here?

</line>


<line>
Only the future.

</line>


<line>
This is horrifying

and it doesn't look legal,

whatever it is, you'd better

cut me in for ten percent.

</line>


<line>
I could cut you off a lot more than that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clown dentists laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whose kid is that?

</line>


<line>
Look, if you didn't want me

to turn your apartment

into a base of operations

for my new clown-dentist venture,

you should have specified that

when I moved in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mommy</name>? Where's my mom?

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Oh!

</line>


<line>
All right. You're clearly doing

important work here.

</line>


<line>
I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have a quick nightcap

and go to bed.

Hey, what happened to your necklace?

</line>


<line>
Oh, fish! Fish, fish, fish, fish.

</line>


<line>
It must have fallen off!

</line>


<line>
-[knocking]

-[<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>] Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
-[all gasp]

-Yeah, just a second!

</line>


<line>
-Todd, get these clowns outta here!

-Go, go, go, go.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, hello, handsome.

-Oh, thank <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

</line>


<line>
You didn't come home, didn't answer

your phone. I was worried.

</line>


<line>
Aw, you was worried?

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name> told me you might be here.

Did you fire him?

</line>


<line>
That hipster <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name>,

always getting in my personal biz-natch.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you still had this place.

Why do you still have this place?

</line>


<line>
Okay, what? Third degree much?

</line>


<line>
-Have you been drinking?

-It's fine, okay?

</line>


<line>
-I get to drink because baby went gone!

-What?

</line>


<line>
"Gone, baby, gone."

Like that Ben <name type="PERSON">Affleck</name> movie.

</line>


<line>
That could be a sequel.

<ital>Gone, Baby, Never Was. </ital>Write that down.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, Princess Carolyn.

-It's okay! You know me.

</line>


<line>
I always land on my feet.

</line>


<line>
Take a lickin', keep tickin'.

</line>


<line>
Like a lollipop with Tourette's.

Write that down.

</line>


<line>
So you were lying earlier at dinner?

</line>


<line>
Is that what you're upset about?

That I lied?

</line>


<line>
About losing the baby?

About keeping my apartment?

</line>


<line>
I lied? That's the big sad thing

that happened?

</line>


<line>
Trying to process

what you threw at me.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be fine.

I'll be pregnant again in no time.

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry. Let me take you home.

</line>


<line>
-When you're ready to try again--

-I'm ready!

</line>


<line>
I said I was ready.

</line>


<line>
So we'll go back to the doctor,

maybe talk about other options.

</line>


<line>
I don't need other options.

My mother had 12 kids.

</line>


<line>
My body was made for this.

We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.

</line>


<line>
I know you wanna do this on your own,

but you've had two miscarriages now, and--

</line>


<line>
-Five!

-What?

</line>


<line>
I've had five miscarriages.

</line>


<line>
One last year, now one,

and three others before.

</line>


<line>
-But it's whatever. It's okay.

-Why didn't you tell me?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

I don't want you looking at me like that.

</line>


<line>
Like that! I know I can do this.

</line>


<line>
You can't keep stuff like this from me.

It's not okay.

</line>


<line>
-It's not about you.

-It is. This is about us.

</line>


<line>
You're not allowed to be mad at me.

</line>


<line>
-This is my bad day.

-It's our bad day.

</line>


<line>
It's so easy for you...

to love me when everything's good.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, I...

</line>


<line>
-Let me take you home.

-No.

</line>


<line>
You need to live in this.

You need to get used to this,

because if you're serious about having

a baby with me, this could happen again.

</line>


<line>
Are you prepared for that?

</line>


<line>
This could happen five more times.

But I'm ready for that.

</line>


<line>
Because I want this.

Do you want it that bad?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I just think we should

maybe talk about other options.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Here's another option.

</line>


<line>
-Get out of my apartment!

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
The one you can take home to your parents.

The one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <ital>easy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
-[cork squeaks]

-[ringtone plays]

</line>


<line>
-[beeps]

-What is it?

</line>


<line>
I'm calling about the offers.

I don't want to do 'em.

</line>


<line>
What's the point of being famous

if you wait in line?

</line>


<line>
<ital>If you could politely decline</ital>

<ital>on my behalf--</ital>

</line>


<line>
I do not work for you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I started this all wrong.

How was your day?

</line>


<line>
-[moans] Well--

-<ital>Because mine was awful.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I mean, truly, one for the books.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Because I'm a good guy

trying to do the right thing.

</line>


<line>
First, I go for my breakfast <name type="ORG">Pinkberry</name>,

which I had earned

because I had good intentions for today,

they're out of my favorite toppings!

</line>


<line>
<ital>So I go across the street to Menchie's,</ital>

<ital>like some kind of hobo.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
At Menchie's, the stupid teen that

worked there raised her eyebrows at me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"You</name> kidding me?

You're trying to judge me?

</line>


<line>
You have very uneven eyebrows

and you work at a Menchie's."

</line>


<line>
<ital>And don't even get me started</ital>

<ital>on the rancid internment camp</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that is the <name type="GPE">L.A.</name> County <name type="ORG">Court</name>house.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, you wanna know what I do

when I have a really bad,

awful, terrible day?

</line>


<line>
<ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I imagine my great-great-great

granddaughter in the future

talking to her class about me.

</line>


<line>
She's poised and funny,

and tells people about me

and how everything worked out

in the end.

</line>


<line>
And when I think about that,

</line>


<line>
I think about how everything's

going to work out.

</line>


<line>
Because how else could she tell people?

</line>


<line>
But it's... fake.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well... it makes me feel better.
