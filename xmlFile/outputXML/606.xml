pilot the airplane!

There were no survivors.

In other news, the newly formed

Hollywoo "Guild of Assistants"

</line>


<line>
is meeting with industry

power brokers today

</line>


<line>
to negotiate terms

for a standard agreement.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm optimistic about the coming talks</ital>

<ital>and confident we can avoid a strike.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Our demands are reasonable,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and our services</ital>

<ital>are crucial to this industry.</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right, you little pishers,

let's wrap this up quick so you can all

go back to getting me wrong coffees.

</line>


<line>
-What do you want?

-We have one request.

</line>


<line>
To not be treated like garbage.

</line>


<line>
It appears we are at an impasse.

You need to call my doula!

Oh, no. Did I really drink last night?

</line>


<line>
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.

I-- [stutters]

</line>


<line>
-Did anyone see me?

-You were in here all night.

</line>


<line>
Nobody can know about this.

</line>


<line>
There are 20 struggling addicts

in this building who are counting on me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> Of course.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go home, take a shower.

</line>


<line>
-This never happened.

-Agreed.

But how do I get out of here

without anyone seeing me?

-Okay, okay, easy.

This requires a surprising amount

of upper-body strength.

Stop swinging. Just slide down.

</line>


<line>
Am I being inconspicuous?

</line>


<line>
Yes. Plus or minus the yelling.

</line>


<line>
-I'm just gonna let go.

-Don't--

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Hello, <name type="PERSON">Jorge</name>.

-I have some news. It's about your mother.

</line>


<line>
Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,

inserting yourself into our family

and ruining my life?

</line>


<line>
Because I already heard that news

like 25 years ago, <name type="PERSON">Jorge</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I didn't come to your home to fight.

-Then joke's on you

because you didn't come to my home at all.

</line>


<line>
-I just sleep on the couch...

-[<name type="PERSON">Jorge</name> sighs]

</line>


<line>
-...since you and Mom gave me the boot.

-That was ten years ago.

</line>


<line>
Which, by the way,

is the only thing you ever gave me.

</line>


<line>
I gave you my name,

and you have clearly wasted it.

</line>


<line>
Do you know what the <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name> name

stands for?

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Jorge</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>! C for cerebral!

H for high-minded! A for analytical!

</line>


<line>
V for veracious! E for efficacious!

</line>


<line>
And Z for zealously practical.

</line>


<line>
Feels like a cheat on the Z.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, your mother needs your help.

</line>


<line>
Well, then instead of sending her husband,

she should have asked me herself,

if it's so important to her.

</line>


<line>
-She's in a coma.

-A rudeness coma?

</line>


<line>
No, a regular coma.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>! Why didn't you open with that?

</line>


<line>
Please. Your mother needs a kidney.

</line>


<line>
I put her on the donor waiting list,

but if you're a match...

</line>


<line>
Oh. I'm sorry.

Of course I would give Mom my kidney.

</line>


<line>
-Then there's no time to waste--

-"Would" give her my kidney.

</line>


<line>
"Would." You need to work

on your listening skills.

</line>


<line>
I sold my extra kidney just last week.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-I wanted to buy these sock puppets.

</line>


<line>
You sold your kidney for... [groans]

I'm sorry I came.

</line>


<line>
If you'd like to visit your mother--

</line>


<line>
Wait. What if instead

of visiting my mother,

we got my kidney back?

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>!

Field trip to the organ market!

<line>
Princess Carolyn, this is a catastrophe.

</line>


<line>
-You know it.

-This strike has shut down the whole city!

</line>


<line>
Assistants want respect?

</line>


<line>
If we respect them, how are we supposed

to work through our rage issues?

</line>


<line>
On our spouses and children?

That doesn't seem fair.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be a better way!

</line>


<line>
Uh, maybe we could circumvent

giving the assistants what they want

by giving them what they think they want.

</line>


<line>
You know, like how we satiate TV creators

by giving them little vanity cards

at the end of episodes,

then sell the shows to streaming networks

that auto-skip the end credits

so no one even sees the vanity cards!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

But what do assistants want?

iTunes gift cards? <name type="ORG">Amazon</name> gift cards?

</line>


<line>
I honestly can't think of another thing

an assistant would want.

</line>


<line>
When I was an assistant,

the only thing I wanted

was not to be an assistant anymore.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Princess Carolyn, I'll say to you

what I said to <name type="PERSON">David</name> Levy

when we were developing

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Addams Family</ital>

and brainstorming ancillary characters,

like cousins and whatnot: That's Itt!

</line>


<line>
-[man] Hey! Sad dog!

-Ha-ha! You know it!

</line>


<line>
Wow. Mr. Peanutbutter

and Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name> in the same room?

</line>


<line>
What is this? Two days ago

when I almost hit you with my car?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> No! That was outside!

</line>


<line>
Listen, I've been trying

to get in touch with you.

</line>


<line>
I got a call from this mental health

advocacy group.

</line>


<line>
Those guys are jizzin' their pants

over your heroic admission

of your struggle with depression,

and they wanna help you

share your story with the world.

</line>


<line>
The world, huh?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to set up a meeting,

but my assistant went on strike,

and phones, for me, are, like, what?

</line>


<line>
Even if you had your assistant,

it wouldn't do any good.

</line>


<line>
My reps' assistants

are all on strike, too.

</line>


<line>
Oh, bummer. Guess there's no way

to get in touch then.

</line>


<line>
Too bad. I'd love to get together.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, fancy room.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, <name type="PERSON">Stinky <name type="PERSON">Susan</name></name>.

</line>


<line>
Huh? [sniffs]

</line>


<line>
-Where to?

-Um...

</line>


<line>
Home, I-- I guess.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey! Stop the car. Let me out here.

</line>


<line>
Wow, already stopping for a drink?

</line>


<line>
Thank you,

your commentary is very helpful.

</line>


<line>
This mood about "never have another drop

of alcohol again?"

</line>


<line>
-Are we sure about this?

-Okay, Doctor Champ, clearly, you--

</line>


<line>
I'm sitting here, like,

whatever happened to moderation, buddy?

</line>


<line>
So, you're telling me

the guiding philosophy

of the six months of rehab

I just paid for is complete bullshit?

</line>


<line>
Hey, man, it works for you,

it works for you.

</line>


<line>
As for me? Uh, check, please!

</line>


<line>
No, that's a figure of speech.

I don't want the check.

</line>


<line>
Please replenish me with another mar-gar.

-Howdy, howdy!

Welcome to <name type="PERSON">Mike</name> and <name type="ORG">Morgan</name>'s

<name type="ORG">House</name> of Organs!

</line>


<line>
We handle all your matters,

from keyboards to bladders.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mike</name>, give it a rest.

</line>


<line>
-What's with all the boxes?

-We're going out of business.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
I told you

we should just stick to the pianos.

</line>


<line>
You wanted to expand into body parts.

</line>


<line>
You printed the sign that said,

</line>


<line>
"For all your organ needs."

I was just trying to keep us honest.

</line>


<line>
Judging from the foolishness

of your business plan,

</line>


<line>
I assume you don't keep records,

but we're trying to track down

my son's kidney.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
Sorry, all our kidneys went to <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

Whitewhale</name> bought us out.

</line>

because he's a rich old guy

who wants to live forever.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
Well, this was a pointless excursion.

I'm heading back to the hospital.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

</line>


<line>
No. It's my fault

for expecting anything different.

</line>


<line>
-[door opens, closes]

-[groans]

</line>

Can we offer you anything on your way out?

</line>


<line>
You want a <name type="PERSON">Wurlitzer</name> or a spleen

or an industrial-sized tub

of general anesthesia?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, give me the anesthesia.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> You could sneak in

during the party

as long as nobody's estranged husband

who's a cop is visiting.

</line>


<line>
Holiday party, huh?

</line>


<line>
-What? Where am I?

-You're in <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Hi, I'm <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>. This is <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>.

-How you doin'?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Are you ready for introductions

or are you still processing

the whole being kidnapped

across state lines?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, what?

</line>


<line>
We're breaking

into the Whitewhale building.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-To get back my kidney and save Mom

and prove to you

that I'm not just a wacky screw-up

who engages primarily

in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.

</line>


<line>
-How did you get me on the plane?

-We did a <ital>Weekend at Bernie's.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-As I was saying,

tonight's the Whitewhale

employee holiday party.

</line>


<line>
Security will be tight, but you can use

my employee ID to get in,

because I'm technically

still on the payroll.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you didn't quit?

We haven't worked there in months.

</line>


<line>
Nobody's noticed!

They keep sending me checks.

</line>


<line>
Cashing them is my way of very gradually

taking down the man from the inside.

</line>


<line>
Hey. C-- can we sidebar for a minute?

Is this really the best use of your time?

</line>


<line>
You've been beating yourself up

about how slowly the book's going. So...

</line>


<line>
But the book is about me

and my life, so by living my life,

</line>


<line>
I am in fact working on the book.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to write this book

if you don't want to.

</line>


<line>
Of course I want to.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,

you've been pretty down.

</line>


<line>
-Not yourself. <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>--

-Actually, pretty down is myself.

</line>


<line>
Can we talk about this later?

We're being rude.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you offer them

one of your fancy beers?

</line>


<line>
So, all we need to do

is get into the party,

figure out where the kidneys are,

find my kidney, and sneak out,

all without drawing attention

to ourselves.

</line>


<line>
And be careful, because

if Whitewhale</name> catches you,

he can legally murder you.

</line>


<line>
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?

</line>


<line>
The barley was from <name type="GPE">Portland</name>, <name type="GPE">Maine</name>,

but the brewery is in <name type="GPE">Portland</name>, Oregon!

</line>


<line>
This plan is ludicrous.

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe instead

of criticizing everything

like you've done my entire life,

you can get on board?

</line>


<line>
It's gonna work out.

</line>


<line>
Things don't just work out, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>!

</line>


<line>
Of course they do!

I don't know why you're so negative!

</line>


<line>
Do you want to help Mom,

or do you wanna just go back

to the hospital and wait?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Okay. I'm in.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thunder rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't feel comfortable negotiating

without my fellow assistants present.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. This is not about that.

</line>


<line>
Good, because our demands haven't changed.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Casey</name>, it's been so thrilling to see you

grow into your role as strike captain.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> You know, there's an opening

at my company for a development exec.

</line>


<line>
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Uh...

</line>


<line>
I'd have to think about it.

I've never rea--

</line>


<line>
You'd get overpaid to read scripts,

company credit card,

and a parking spot in the good garage.

</line>


<line>
-Um...

-Plus, your own assistant.

</line>


<line>
-An... assistant?

-[thunder rumbling]

</line>


<line>
-That is, of course, if the strike ends.

-[giggles]

</line>


<line>
Well, that's a very generous offer,

but I'd have to talk it over

with my colleagues.

</line>


<line>
Why? Those are assistants.

</line>


<line>
You're not one of them anymore.

You're one of us.

look like their last names.

Oh, yeah! <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> <name type="PERSON">Nguyen</name>.

Doctor Champ, what is your plan?

</line>


<line>
Just gotta drink enough to be steady.

</line>


<line>
Then, you take me back to <name type="PERSON">Pastiches</name>

and keep me out of trouble.

</line>


<line>
That way, you don't have to go home

and I can be a good therapy horse.

</line>

put my picture on a magazine. [slurps]

</line>


<line>
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.

</line>


<line>
You don't care about me!

You're scared of this guy.

</line>


<line>
You can't help anybody else

unless you're honest with yourself.

</line>


<line>
-Know what I mean?

-No. I never know what you mean.

</line>


<line>
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared

if you'd given me real therapy

over the last six months

instead of just plying me

with folksy aphorisms.

</line>


<line>
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,

a subtle but legally

important distinction.

</line>


<line>
Besides, you wouldn't accept

real therapy from me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and why's that?

</line>


<line>
Gee, I don't know,

maybe because I'm a horse,

so I remind you of your father,

so you simultaneously resent me

and crave my approval,

an approval which,

ironically, if granted--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I would dismiss immediately

and then use as an excuse to resent you

even more, what's your point?

</line>


<line>
My point is, you're stunted from having

healthy relationships with horses, idiot!

</line>


<line>
Oh, really? Well, if that were true,

</line>


<line>
I would have almost

no other horses in my life.

Right, it's almost as if all your friends

and loved ones

are humans or dogs or cats--

</line>


<line>
But then how do you explain

the one horse I do care about,

my half-sister Hollyhock,

who is also a reminder of my father?

</line>


<line>
If your theory were true,

wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,

desperate for her to love me

but unwilling to be vulnerable enough

to allow her to hurt me?

</line>


<line>
You blockhead, she's not your father!

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock reminds you

of the horse you hate the most. Yourself!

</line>


<line>
Okay, you got me!

</line>


<line>
My parents gave me an internalized

self-hatred of horses.

</line>


<line>
So, my horse body is a prison

that I can never escape.

</line>


<line>
This manifests in rotten behavior

because I subconsciously believe

I deserve to be punished,

but being famous, I'm never punished,

so I act out even more.

</line>


<line>
And since this pattern

is so woven into my identity,

it is unfathomable to me that it can

ever be curbed, so instead, I drink!

</line>


<line>
Uh... Check, please!

</line>


<line>
So, the only way I can progress

is to return to my life as a sober man

and finally hold myself accountable

for my actions, past and future.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is this what therapy is?

</line>


<line>
Why do you keep bringing me checks?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[glasses clanking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uh... Doctor Champ?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[elevator dings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
-Sorry, folks!

-[both gasp]

</line>


<line>
This floor's off-limits.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, but...

-Oh, thank <name type="PERSON">God</name> you're here!

</line>


<line>
I saw someone at the buffet

putting ketchup on a hot dog.

</line>


<line>
-What? Not in my town!

-[keys jangling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[elevator dings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Wow, you are really good at this.

-Let's go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Ooh, wow. Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Oh, look. People who selected kidneys

might also enjoy small intestines.

</line>


<line>
Just the kidney. We don't need

to be up-sold on other innards.

</line>


<line>
Yes, sir.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you for... [clears throat] this.

</line>


<line>
Uh. Once your mother is okay,

we will never bother you again.

</line>


<line>
-I know that's what you want.

-Why would I want that?

</line>


<line>
-You never understood me.

-I raised you as my own flesh.

</line>


<line>
I was tough on you

because I expected big things from you.

</line>


<line>
You weren't tough. You were mean.

</line>


<line>
-Because the world is mean!

-Not my world!

</line>


<line>
I wanted so much for you, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to push you to be your best self.

I see now that I failed you.

</line>


<line>
But you didn't fail me

because I am not a failure.

</line>


<line>
Look... [sighs] Okay, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
Why do you need to be proud of me

on your terms?

</line>


<line>
Why can't you see I'm living a good life?

I have friends. I have a job--

</line>


<line>
You sleep on the couch

and you play with puppets all day.

</line>


<line>
I'm happy, <name type="PERSON">Jorge</name>.

What more do you want from me?

</line>


<line>
I want to know that you're okay!

</line>


<line>
Then why haven't you called in ten years?

</line>


<line>
You don't think I wanted to?

I'm not the one who...

</line>


<line>
-What?

-[<name type="PERSON">Jorge</name> exhales]

</line>


<line>
She loves you, your mother.

</line>


<line>
But she's very proud.

If you called her, she would talk to you.

</line>


<line>
Well, she can't talk now

because she's in a coma, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah.

</line>


<line>
What are they talking about?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

-[keys beeping]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Chavezes! You got company!

</line>


<line>
Get out of there now! Do you read me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> on radio]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Hello? Hello?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>? Why is there a walkie-talkie

in our kitchen?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">God</name> damn it!

-[man] Uh...

</line>


<line>
Excuse me? This garage

is for shopping center customers only.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Okay, fine, I'll buy a pretzel.

</line>


<line>
-Or you could just leave.

-No, now I want the pretzel.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>]</nonVerbComm><ital> Hey, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, get me a pretzel,</ital>

<ital>too, please. Love you, okay?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Jorge</name> gasps]</nonVerbComm> Someone's coming.

We have to go.

</line>


<line>
I'm not going until I get my kidney.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, this is serious.

-Yes, I understand.

</line>


<line>
You are very serious.

</line>


<line>
You read serious books

and listen to Sirius XM.

</line>


<line>
We have to go right now.

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Why do you always fight me?

</line>


<line>
Why do you always try

to make me leave places?

</line>


<line>
-[man] Hey!

-[both gasp]

</line>


<line>
Stay right where you are!

</line>


<line>
-Whoa! [exhales]

-[grumbles]

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uh, I'm sure the other assistants

will be here any minute.

</line>


<line>
Traffic's real bad because of the rain.

</line>


<line>
No one else is coming, <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Uh... because of the rain?

-They got promoted.

</line>


<line>
Your ranks are divided.

</line>


<line>
Your leadership has abandoned you.

Face it, the strike is over.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Okay.

</line>


<line>
We've drawn up a new collective agreement.

</line>


<line>
You get none of the things you asked for

and you start work again Monday.

</line>


<line>
Sounds fair.

</line>


<line>
If I sign this, does that mean

I get a promotion, too?

</line>


<line>
-Sure, <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>. Someday.

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Carolyn,

I'd love to give you a raise,

but you're thinking like an assistant.

</line>


<line>
Any day now, you're gonna get promoted

to agent and sign a brand-new contract,

so why are you concerning yourself

with these assistantly trifles?

</line>


<line>
You really think I have

what it takes to be an agent?

</line>


<line>
Someday, sure!

But for now, you're my assistant,

and since you've got a similar build

to the angry lady

I fell on at the post office,

</line>


<line>
I need you to try on these apology bikinis

and report back where they pinch.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-You got it, boss.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>] Um...

-<name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>, don't sign that!

</line>


<line>
I just remembered

there's a typo on page 12!

</line>


<line>
Instead of "billable hours,"

I wrote, "<name type="PERSON">Billy Bob</name> showers!"

</line>


<line>
Ooh, that's not gonna fly, P.C.

</line>


<line>
That guy hasn't showered since <ital>Bad Santa.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Man Who Wasn't There?</ital>

More like "Man Who Doesn't Wash There."

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sling Blade?</ital> More like "Please Bathe!"

</line>


<line>
<ital>Monster's Ball? </ital>More like "Monster Balls."

Great actor, though.

</line>


<line>
Let me fix up a new version

and you can come back

and sign it tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
I'll walk you to your car.

</line>


<line>
Well, this is my car.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-No. I don't own a car.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> So why did we walk

three blocks in the rain?

</line>


<line>
I panicked! I've never been in charge

of where to go before!

</line>


<line>
You're clearly out of your depth

in these negotiations.

</line>


<line>
Take this number.

</line>


<line>
Wow. This a lot of money,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
That's not an offer, it's a phone number!

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
-Can you drive me home?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Officer, I...

-Sir, did this man attack you?

</line>


<line>
-What? No.

-You can tell me if he attacked you.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

-Look, this is all a misunderstanding.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to take

this kidney back to my mom.

</line>


<line>
Whitewhale's got like a hundred of these.

He won't even miss this one.

</line>


<line>
Well, aren't you a little scamp.

</line>


<line>
-[both laugh]

-Oh, stop!

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Armageddon? </ital>More like "Arma-gettin'

Away From This Stinky <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>!"

</line>


<line>
What the...? Hey, who's in my chair?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Turteltaub,

I thought our meeting was at 9 a.m.

</line>


<line>
-It appears to be 9:03.

-[sighs] Hello.

</line>


<line>
If you're serious about negotiating,

it's imprudent to send the message

you don't respect our time.

</line>


<line>
To start these negotiations

on the right foot,

</line>


<line>
I suggest we adjourn for the day

and start in earnest tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
-On schedule?

-Um...

</line>


<line>
-Okay?

-Fabulous. Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What the shell was that?

-Let the negotiations begin.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, I, uh... owe you an apology.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-[inhales, exhales]

</line>


<line>
I know I was hard on you

when you were growing up,

but I was trying to protect you.

</line>


<line>
Nothing came easy for me.

</line>


<line>
It took hard work, focus, discipline

to get me where I am today.

</line>


<line>
Things didn't just work out.

</line>


<line>
But I should have realized: you're white.

</line>


<line>
I forgive you.

</line>


<line>
She's awake.

</line>


<line>
Do you wanna come say hello?

I'm sure she would love to see you.

</line>


<line>
Well, she has my number.

</line>


<line>
-That's cold, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

-What do you expect?

</line>


<line>
I'm a <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Huh? Where am I?

-You're at <name type="ORG">Partridges</name>,

the rehab clinic

founded by <name type="PERSON">Danny</name> Bonaduce.

</line>


<line>
-What about <name type="PERSON">Pastiches</name>?

-I told them I was checking you in here.

</line>


<line>
Why would you do that?

</line>


<line>
Those people need me

to be an example of success.

</line>


<line>
You can't help anybody else

unless you're honest with yourself.

</line>


<line>
-A wise man told me that.

-Who? What wise man?

</line>


<line>
You did.

I was being poetic and you ruined it.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't listen to me. I'm a drunk!

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But the first step is admitting it.

</line>


<line>
You've destroyed me.

I can never go back to <name type="PERSON">Pastiches</name> now.

</line>


<line>
My husband will leave me.

</line>


<line>
I promised him I would never drink again

after what happened to our daughter.

</line>


<line>
Uh... What happened to your daughter?

</line>


<line>
You know nothing of my life

and you think you know what's best for me?

</line>


<line>
The only reason I got drunk

in the first place

is because of your contraband vodka!

</line>


<line>
-Well, yes, technically, that's true.

-Of course you did this to me.

</line>


<line>
Because I cared about you.

</line>


<line>
And you ruin people who care about you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm> Well, best of luck.

</line>


<line>
I want you to remember this, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

I want you to remember what you did to me.

</line>


<line>
I remember everything. I'm sober now.
