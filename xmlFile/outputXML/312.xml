When you sang that one ballad

that was such a moving tribute

<line>
Right.

I swear you are, like,

the only one I have left.

I am this close to falling off

I know I'm smiling right now,

but the light inside me is dying.

</line>


<line>
Uh, what?

<line>
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing

about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

Oh. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want me to be on your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

I have the script with me

if you want to take a look at it.

</line>


<line>
Um, okay. Why don't you put it

on that pile over there?

</line>


<line>
And I'll get to it

when I have some free time.

</line>


<line>
-Over here?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'd love to keep hanging out,

but these doctors need their posters,

and I'm already pretty exhausted.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld probably go.

-Well, <name type="PERSON">T</name>om, as the spaghetti cooks,

it will expand, smothering the town

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe for rescue would be

if someone had an enormous quantity

of spaghetti strainers

</line>


<line>
just sitting aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

</line>


<line>
but that person would also need

access to a fleet of drivers

to transport said spaghetti strainers,

and in order to strain

the spaghetti fast enough,

the drivers would also need to be

incredibly strong swi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers,

like, just as an example,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t, sexy killer whales.

Is there such a savior

I can't keep lying to myself,

saying "I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> change." I'm poison.

I have nothing to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

When I was a kid,

I used to watch you on <name type="PERSON">T</name>V.

</line>


<line>
And you know I didn't have

the best family.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hings weren't that great for me.

</line>


<line>
But, for half an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur every week,

I got to watch this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

about four people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> had nobody,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> came together and became a family.

</line>


<line>
And, for half an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur every week,

I had a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

and it helped me survive.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, there are millions of people

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are better off for having known you.

</line>


<line>
Why did you never tell me that?

</line>


<line>
I guess to preserve some fiction

of journalistic objectivity.

</line>


<line>
-Like that's a thing.

-I know you don't want to hear this,

but you're too good to be writing

<name type="ORG">Instagram</name> captions for celebrities.

-I'm not just--

-I'm sorry, but you are.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know you are.

-Okay. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
And I wish you didn't get so distant

after you moved out.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know me better than anybody,

and you can't not be a part of my life.

-No, it's me, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

Where you say you want to do it,

but then, I find out

you don't actually want to do it,

and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

</line>


<line>
And, at the airport, on the way <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

I get one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se big pretzels,

Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe some of that press

makes its way to this reader

because she is not a fan

of <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>.

</line>


<line>
-She hates it.

-I don't hate <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>.

</line>


<line>
I just think it objectifies women

and contributes to a cheap and damaging

culture of sexist co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>odification

that <name type="ORG">un</name>dercuts the exact reason

it was started in the first place.

</line>


<line>
Yes, but this objectification of women

ended up saving lots of lives,

many of w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m were also women,

so, therefore, not sexist?

</line>


<line>
I can't argue with that.

</line>

you don't have to anymore,

Hey, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, what have you been up to?

-I don't want to just jump into my next--

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>'s sister <name type="PERSON">Stefani</name>

It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/

"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

<line>

I'll set a meeting.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that could be cool.

Why don't you give her my info?

</line>


<line>
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.

It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.

</line>

-Except enjoying your time off, right?

-Right.

Wow, another amazing offer!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're always making great connections.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's probably why you were

such a good manager.

</line>


<line>
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.

-Oh, right. Sorry.

</line>


<line>
Well, whatever it was,

I'm glad that it's over,

because I don't want

to share you with anybody.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe that was the problem!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe what was the problem?

-All this time, I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught I was an agent,

but what if what I was really

supposed to be was a manager?

</line>


<line>
-What's the difference?

-It's a completely different line of work.

</line>


<line>
An agent helps a client find jobs,

but a manager helps manage

a client's career.

</line>


<line>
-It so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds exactly the same.

-I think I'm having an epiphany.

</line>


<line>
It's like I've been wearing

the wrong bra size this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time.

</line>


<line>
Okay, if this is the thing

that'll make you happy,

then I totally support you,

but it kind of so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like you're just

going back to the same sort of job

that made you miserable

for the last 20 years.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>oo many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"

or not enough?

<line>
No. On page 18,

</line>

to put on the roller skates,

and she r<name type="ORG">un</name>s out of the room crying,

and then, the <name type="ORG">Horse</name> says,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat went well."

</line>


<line>
-Anything about that feel weird to you?

-No, see, the <name type="ORG">Horse</name> is being sarcastic.

</line>


<line>
It didn't go well. So, when the <name type="ORG">Horse</name>

says, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat went well," it's f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
-Dramatic irony.

-No, I get the irony.

and "crutch" is an ableist term.

but I will not apologize for it.

<line>
So, can I ask what

the business model is here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I'm rich.

I'm not doing this to make money.

</line>


<line>
I'm doing this to make connections

with real women

and extend my personal brand

as a real down-to-earth <ital>chica</ital>

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares about real women.

</line>

</line>


<line>
Yes! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is exactly the idea,

whatever you were about to say.

-One thing t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh. Is anything off limits?

</line>


<line>
Like, if you had to write a piece

about your husband, could you do it?

</line>


<line>
-Why would I have to do that?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Because his company

is basically <name type="NORP">Hooters</name> on wheels?

</line>


<line>
-He's actually selling that company.

-Well, he's still a public figure.

</line>


<line>
What if Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

does something problematic

and you have a real <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t take?

</line>


<line>
If I have a problem with my husband,

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> talk to him about it directly.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so what if you did that

and he didn't listen,

and you knew that,

as much as you love him

and as much as he loves you,

he's never <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get it?

</line>


<line>
And meanwhile, you also knew

that all your readers looked up to you

and wanted to read your opinion?

</line>


<line>
Would you write about it then?

<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got the job?
