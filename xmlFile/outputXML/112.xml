<ital>[polite applause]</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>[male TV host] When we booked you</ital>

<ital>for this show,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you'd just won the Triple Crown,</ital>

<ital>but then just this week,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I open up the newspaper,</ital>

<ital>and look at this...</ital>

</line>


<line>
"<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat

Under Investigation."

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do

with that?

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's

a different <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha ha ha. No,

but seriously, folks,

there is no truth

to these allegations.

</line>


<line>
I have never bet on

horse racing,

and I certainly did not bet on

my own races.

</line>


<line>
Although I did bet the network's

gonna give your show

back to Joey Bishop.

</line>


<line>
O-- ho ho-- kay.

</line>


<line>
We get letters here on the show,

and one particular letter,

for you, actually, struck

a chord with our producers.

</line>


<line>
This is from BoJack H.

BoJack is nine years old.

</line>


<line>
BoJack writes,

"Dear <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat,

</line>


<line>
I am a horse just like you.

</line>


<line>
I like to watch racing,

and you are my favorite racer."

</line>


<line>
Smart kid.

</line>


<line>
"When I grow up,

I want to be just like you,

and I think

I'm on the right track.

</line>


<line>
Get it? Track,

because horses r<name type="ORG">un</name> on tracks,

and you are a horse,

and I am a horse.

</line>


<line>
Do you get it? Do you

get my joke about the track?"

</line>


<line>
Okay, there's

a whole page of this.

</line>


<line>
Should I write him back

and tell him I get it?

</line>


<line>
He goes on,

"My question for you is,

</line>


<line>
I am a good kid,

and I like to play,

and I like to go to school,

but sometimes I get sad.

</line>


<line>
What do you do

when you get sad?

</line>


<line>
How do you not be sad?

Sincerely, BoJack."

</line>


<line>
That's a great letter.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, when I was your age,

I got sad.

</line>


<line>
A lot.

</line>


<line>
I didn't come from

such a great home,

but one day, I started r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning,

and that seemed to make sense,

so then I just kept r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, when you get sad,

you r<name type="ORG">un</name> straight ahead

and you keep r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning forward,

no matter what.

</line>


<line>
There are people in your life

who are gonna try to

hold you back, slow you down,

but you don't let them.

</line>


<line>
Don't you stop r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning and

don't you ever look behind you.

</line>


<line>
There's nothing for you

behind you.

</line>


<line>
All that exists is what's ahead.

</line>

And the Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>

for Best Comedy or Musical

</line>


<line>
goes to BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

my friend,

</line>


<line>
for his book <ital>One Trick Pony.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> This is a first win

for BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

and his first appearance

at the <name type="ORG">Globe</name> ceremony

</line>


<line>
since his forced removal

in 1992

</line>


<line>
after he exchanged blows

with Sir Paul McCartney.

</line>


<line>
Wow, what an honor.

</line>


<line>
I have to thank

the <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name> Foreign Press.

</line>


<line>
I feel like I should mention

</line>


<line>
that my book

was not a comedy or a musical.

</line>


<line>
Do you guys actually watch

the movies you give awards to?

</line>


<line>
'Cause I kind of

get the sense that--

</line>


<line>
Also, my book was not a movie.

You do know that, right?

</line>


<line>
We're friends.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the response to this

book has been incredible.

</line>


<line>
These last three months

have been really amazing.

</line>


<line>
You know, a lot of people

said to me,

</line>


<line>
"You sure you want to

publish this book?

</line>


<line>
It's pretty personal."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "If I can make

just one person out there

</line>


<line>
feel a little less alone,

then it's all worth it."

</line>


<line>
And they said,

"That's really brave."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Well, I'm not one

to call myself brave,

but since you said it,

yeah, I am."

</line>


<line>
- After-party at my restaurant!

- [cheering, applause]

</line>


<line>
Why did I say after-party

at my restaurant?

</line>


<line>
I do not want to throw a party.

</line>


<line>
It did seem <name type="ORG">un</name>like you. I'm

gonna go get some cotton candy.

</line>


<line>
- You want some?

- No.

</line>


<line>
- Yes.

- There he is, man of the hour.

</line>


<line>
- Hello, other grown up.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, cheer up, dummy.

Your book is a huge success.

</line>


<line>
Everybody loves you.

You just won a Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>.

</line>


<line>
If you can't be happy tonight,

maybe you'll

never be happy again.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, is that

supposed to be encouraging?

</line>


<line>
- Because it's super-bleak.

- Vincent Adultman...

how are things

at the old nine to five?

</line>


<line>
Good. I went to

the stock market today.

</line>


<line>
I did a business.

</line>


<line>
I keep telling him

he works too hard.

</line>


<line>
Come on, Vincent, let's get away

from the rat race.

</line>


<line>
Take a cruise someplace

wet and <name type="NORP">Latin</name>.

</line>


<line>
I mean, can you imagine

this body in a swimsuit?

</line>


<line>
- I literally cannot.

- Vincent, let's do a lap.

</line>


<line>
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

</line>


<line>
I feel like you two

would love each other.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Easy, easy.

</line>


<line>
I got to hand it to Diane.

</line>


<line>
This book has been everything

she said it would be.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, she knows

what she's doing.

</line>


<line>
How is Diane? I haven't

seen her since...

</line>


<line>
Well, I haven't seen her

in a while.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, the book's

been huge for her, too.

</line>


<line>
She's practically as famous

as I am now.

</line>


<line>
- We're like the Brangelinas.

- Well, I'm happy she's happy.

</line>


<line>
- And how are you?

- Well, it's been really hard--

</line>


<line>
Erica, is that you? Who

let you out of the burn ward?

</line>


<line>
- Get over here, you.

- Uhh.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me. I just have to tell

you how much I love your book.

</line>


<line>
It's so naked and honest

and revealing.

</line>


<line>
It is? Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
I love the part about

how you became famous

so you could be constantly

surro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded by distraction

and wouldn't have to be

alone with yourself.

</line>


<line>
I thought that was

a really profo<name type="ORG">un</name>d observation.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, definitely.

So profo<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
- Do you want to get out of here?

- What?

</line>


<line>
Come back to my place,

maybe get a little more naked,

</line>


<line>
- honest and revealing?

- Oh, no. No, thanks.

</line>


<line>
- What about you?

- Yeah, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman moaning and panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Oh-- Whoa.

- [screams]

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, Diane.

- You still friends with BoJack?

</line>


<line>
Heard you two

were on the outs.

</line>


<line>
You gonna write another book

about it?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you looking at

some oranges?

</line>


<line>
You gonna write a book

about those oranges, huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hello.

<ital>- Diane.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Sebastian St. Claire here,

famed billionaire

philanthropist/adventurer.

</line>


<line>
Please, hold your applause.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- You can applaud a little.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
I got your number

from Pinky Penguin.

</line>


<line>
I'm looking for a journalist

to follow me aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

for a few months

and document my daring exploits

aiding ravaged comm<name type="ORG">un</name>ities

and displaced people.

</line>


<line>
- Ssss.

- Wow, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds amazing.

</line>


<line>
But that's not usually

the kind of thing I write about.

</line>


<line>
Diane, if you can make people

care about BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

surely you can make them

care about emaciated orphans

with missing limbs.

</line>


<line>
We need to wake people up.

</line>


<line>
Well, I am a morning person.

</line>


<line>
I hope you mean mourning

with a "u,"

because, Diane,

this is deadly serious.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, of course.

</line>


<line>
You want to spend

three months in <name type="GPE">Sudan</name>?

</line>


<line>
Not just there. We're also

going to <name type="GPE">Haiti</name> and <name type="NORP">Thai</name>land

and <name type="GPE">Uganda</name> and <name type="GPE">Chechnya</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

</line>


<line>
I want to do something

important.

</line>


<line>
I want to help people

and do good work

and sleep on the gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

and poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
Honey, nobody wants to

poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I do. Maybe

I want to poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
If you want to poop in a

bucket, we can get you a bucket.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to go all the way

the Chechnylavakia.

</line>


<line>
Am I saying that right?

</line>


<line>
It's not just

the pooping in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
I think it might be good for me

to get out of L.A.

for a little bit.

</line>


<line>
Sweetie, you know I support

you, whatever you want to do,

but you're not gonna find

what you're looking for

in these awful made-up places.

</line>


<line>
The <name type="ORG">un</name>iverse

is a cruel, <name type="ORG">un</name>caring void.

</line>


<line>
The key to being happy

isn't a search for meaning.

</line>


<line>
It's to just keep yourself busy

with <name type="ORG">un</name>important nonsense,

and eventually, you'll be dead.

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess

I can keep my options open.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whistles gleefully]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, can I ask you something?

</line>


<line>
Did Vincent seem extra weird

to you last night?

</line>


<line>
Well, he's still three kids

in a trench coat, so, no.

</line>


<line>
We're going through a rough

patch. It's hard, you know.

</line>


<line>
He's works a full time job

at the business factory,

so when he gets home,

he just wants to <name type="ORG">un</name>wind

by watching R-rated movies.

</line>


<line>
Ahh, I thought I was ready

for a real adult relationship,

</line>


<line>
- but--

- [snores]

</line>


<line>
Enough about me.

BoJack, you are on fire.

</line>


<line>
Oh, are we talking

about me again?

</line>


<line>
We have an offer on the table

for you to play the bad guy

in the new James Bond.

</line>


<line>
- Ehh.

- I agree. Total garbage.

</line>


<line>
But this, it's a new drama

from <name type="ORG">the Coen Brothers</name>.

</line>


<line>
A western about a one-horse town

and you're the horse.

</line>


<line>
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

</line>


<line>
I think now's the time

to finally make "<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat."

</line>


<line>
Really? Now? Aren't you

a little, um, very too old?

</line>


<line>
You asked me what I wanted

to do. That's what I want.

</line>


<line>
That's all I've ever wanted,

and if I can't get it now,

then all of this

has been for nothing.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fish. Of course!

</line>


<line>
Why would you ever

make things easy for me

when instead you could make

things incredibly difficult?

</line>


<line>
Laura, clear out

the rest of my day.

</line>


<line>
I have to push a boulder

up a hill,

and then have it roll over me

time and time again

with no regard

for my well-being.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Attagirl</name>.

</line>


<line>
All right, Todd. <name type="ORG">PB</name> Livin'

needs a new project.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks</name>

has been an enormous success,

but I got into this game

to make movies,

so let's make a movie.

</line>


<line>
Well, I got a stack

of great scripts here.

</line>


<line>
Any one of them

would make a wonderful movie.

</line>


<line>
Fantastic.

</line>


<line>
But I also have this other

non-movie-related idea.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, let's hear

the other idea.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I was

heading down <name type="GPE">Wilshire</name>,

and I saw this empty

store front, and I thought,

</line>


<line>
"You know what

this world needs?"

</line>


<line>
Edge of my seat over here.

</line>


<line>
A store where people can buy

Halloween stuff.

</line>


<line>
Halloween store.

Feel like that's been done.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, in October,

but how come your never see

a Halloween store in January?

</line>


<line>
- It's an <name type="ORG">un</name>tapped market.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
A Halloween store

that's open year-ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
- No, no. Just January.

- Brilliant.

</line>


<line>
That's the kind of idea

that wins Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>s.

</line>


<line>
I actually think the time

is right for "<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat,"

so what do you want to play,

like, <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat's dad

or his grandfather, maybe like

an elderly witch doctor

who puts a curse on him

or something?

</line>


<line>
Lenny, look, I know

I'm a little long in the tooth,

but I think that you

more than anyone

would know

not to co<name type="ORG">un</name>t out an old pro.

</line>


<line>
Don't play the ageism card

with me, kid.

</line>


<line>
I've laid farts that lasted

longer than your entire career.

</line>


<line>
But <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat was dead at 27,

so who we kidding here?

</line>


<line>
Just set the project up

and give me an audition.

</line>


<line>
- That's all I ask.

- All right.

</line>


<line>
You got yourself

a "go" picture, kid.

</line>


<line>
And by you, I mean me.

And by "go" picture,

</line>


<line>
I mean I'll make some phone

calls, we'll see what I can do.

</line>


<line>
And by kid,

I mean middle-aged adult.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whispers]</nonVerbComm> Shh. No, no, no.

Put it here. Put it here.

</line>


<line>
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.

- Ahem.

</line>


<line>
- Has this ever happened to you?

- Has what ever happened to me?

</line>


<line>
- Todd?

- Yes, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>?

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

Why are you talking like that?

</line>


<line>
Todd, I just got

a phenomenal idea

for a Halloween costume.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you and I dash over

to the store right quick

and spend some hard-earned

<name type="GPE">America</name>n money?

</line>


<line>
Oh, but, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>,

didn't you hear?

</line>


<line>
It's January, and

the Halloween store won't open

for another nine months.

</line>


<line>
But I want satisfaction now.

</line>


<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

</line>


<line>
Not to anyone ever

at any time.

</line>


<line>
Ahem. We give you

Halloween in January,

a truly immersive

Halloween experience

for the rest of us.

</line>


<line>
Halloween in January?

Please elaborate.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but before I do,

tell the audience.

</line>


<line>
- Have we ever met before?

- Never.

</line>


<line>
Well, according to facts,

there's more suicides in January

</line>


<line>
- than any other month.

- I'm getting pretty close over here.

</line>


<line>
Also, there's less

Halloween stores. Coincidence?

</line>


<line>
Wow, I'm convinced.

This store could save lives.

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

When your powers combine...

you are somehow even more stupid

than the sum of your stupids.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- Go on.

</line>


<line>
You stop encouraging him

and you stop encouraging him.

</line>


<line>
The two of you

are playing with fire.

</line>


<line>
A fire called

Having a Good Idea.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe

a fire called Friendship.

</line>


<line>
- Fires aren't called things.

- What about the <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> fire?

</line>


<line>
Or Fire Island.

</line>


<line>
- Or Gabe.

- Who's Gabe?

</line>


<line>
Just a fire I met once.

Named him Gabe.

</line>


<line>
- He so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds delightful.

- He was. Good guy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Business, business, business.

Is that all you ever think about?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

</line>


<line>
What's <name type="ORG">un</name>der that coat,

Vincent?

</line>


<line>
- You need to let me in.

- Not right now.

</line>


<line>
I have to call

the guy at the office

and take the car to the place.

</line>


<line>
It's always guys in places

with you.

</line>


<line>
You know, I thought

I wanted to date a real adult,

but I'm actually

yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g at heart.

</line>


<line>
I need to feel the grass

between my toes.

</line>


<line>
I want to wear jeans.

I want to dance.

</line>


<line>
- That's baby stuff.

- No, Vincent.

</line>


<line>
There's more to being an adult

than just work and business

and the tall-person rides at

<name type="ORG">Disney</name>land. I want to have f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
There has to be a difference

between monogamy and monotony.

</line>


<line>
What's mahuman<name type="ORG">un</name>ny?

</line>


<line>
Well, clearly we had

a different <name type="ORG">un</name>derstanding

of what this was.

</line>


<line>
I'd like to be an adult about

this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

</line>


<line>
I think you should just go,

just git. Get out of my life.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Could I have another soda?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you know

Kelsey Jannings, our director.

</line>


<line>
I really appreciate you

giving me this opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat

was kind of my hero as a kid.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, he was

a lot of people's hero.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know, here was a guy

who had everything--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know the story.

I'm the director.

</line>


<line>
Kelsey, be nice.

</line>


<line>
She's just cranky because

she's already seen 30 people

read for this today,

and we are all so goddamn sick

of seeing auditions,

so whenever you're ready.

</line>


<line>
Just jump right in.

</line>


<line>
Great. Let's get to it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stilted]</nonVerbComm> Hey,

ain't you that horse

</line>


<line>
- that won all them races?

- Not today, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
Today I'm just a customer

who wants a warm slice of pie.

</line>


<line>
Can I ask you a question?

</line>


<line>
When you're out there

on that there racetrack,

</line>


<line>
- what are you r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning from?

- You want to know the truth?

</line>


<line>
Nothing.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning

from something, sugar.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning from nothing.

I'm terrified of nothing.

</line>


<line>
People come up to me,

they want my autograph,

they want my picture.

</line>


<line>
They think they recognize

something in me,

and I want to be that person

they think I am, but I'm not.

</line>


<line>
They see a greatness in me, and

they mistake it for goodness,

but I... I know

there's nothing there.

</line>


<line>
As fast as I r<name type="ORG">un</name>,

I can't get way from that.

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- Wow.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I think I speak

for everyone when I say--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God,

Andrew Garfield said yes.

</line>


<line>
- We have our <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

- We got Andrew Garfield?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God,

it's the best day of my life.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Lenny]</nonVerbComm> You don't say no

to Spider-Man.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Kelsey]</nonVerbComm> This movie

is gonna be amazing.

</line>


<line>
Andrew...

</line>


<line>
Garfield!

</line>


<line>
Now, the pills

will give you nightmares--

</line>


<line>
I mean, just horrifying--

but the malaria

will give you death,

so you're going to want to

take the pills, Diane.

</line>


<line>
- Uh-huh.

- Hold on.

</line>


<line>
A mosquito got into my tent.

What do you want?

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone vibrates]

- Hello?

</line>


<line>
Diane, it's Princess Carolyn,

BoJack's agent.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know who you are.

</line>


<line>
I'm the pink cat, the one

who used to date BoJack.

</line>


<line>
We've met a lot of times.

You came to my wedding.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Listen,</ital>

<ital>the <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub Company</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is making a movie</ital>

<ital>about <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And since you're such an expert,

they want to bring you on board

as a character consultant.

</line>


<line>
What does that mean?

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's the cushiest job

in the world.

</line>


<line>
You sit in a fancy chair

and eat pastries all day.

</line>


<line>
And then once a week, you say,

"<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat wouldn't do that."

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I've already

been offered this other thing.

</line>


<line>
And did you know

there are orphans in <name type="GPE">Sudan</name>--

</line>


<line>
You take this job, you can buy

all the orphans you want.

</line>


<line>
No, I don't want to buy them.

</line>


<line>
Look, if you really

want to help people,

it doesn't hurt to have

a little money in your pocket.

</line>


<line>
Take the job now,

help the orphans later.

</line>


<line>
- There's always later.

- Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Okay, talk it over

with your husband.

</line>


<line>
I got to go

get my whiskers trimmed.

</line>


<line>
I r<name type="ORG">un</name> into walls for days,

but I look hot.

</line>


<line>
- How's the pie here?

- Not good.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll take all you got.

</line>


<line>
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl

with some bourbon

</line>


<line>
- and bring me a ladle.

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, we notice you've been

pretty down in the dumps lately,

but we have something that we

think is going to cheer you up.

</line>


<line>
It's an exciting

new business venture

that's equal parts

new and exciting.

</line>


<line>
Another one? What happened

to your Halloween store?

</line>


<line>
- What now?

- Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
The Halloween store.

</line>


<line>
We took the floor out

because Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>

kept scratching up the hardwood,

and then-- Did we ever get

the new floor installed?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Halloween? In January?

</line>


<line>
What a great ide-- Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Anyway, now we're

all about smoodies.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Smoodies.

</line>


<line>
You're saying smoothies,

right? Smoothies.

</line>


<line>
No. Smoodies.

</line>


<line>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand it.

How do you drink a mood?

</line>


<line>
- Like a smoothie.

- So it is a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
No, it's a smoodie--

A mood that you drink.

</line>


<line>
- How do you drink a mood?

- Like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
But do you buy it in a store?

What're the physical attributes?

</line>


<line>
We haven't worked out

all the kinks yet,

but the important thing is

we've gone public,

and we want you to get in on

the gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d floor.

</line>


<line>
See, that's the problem

with all your ideas--

they don't have gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d floors.

</line>


<line>
Finally, a Halloween store

for the rest of-- Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Hello.

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

our la<name type="ORG">un</name>ch party's tonight,

</line>


<line>
- and we'd love it if you came.

- We spared no expense...

that's how confident we are

in our product.

</line>


<line>
- Your product-- Smoodies.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Wait, did you say smoodies

or smoothies?

</line>


<line>
Because we only make--

Which one do we make?

</line>


<line>
I'd like to think

the smoodies make us.

</line>


<line>
Ahh, I can tell by your tone

that that was something smart.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[hip-hop music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Smoodie keychain?

- Smoodie cozy?

</line>


<line>
-Smoodie bottle opener?

</line>


<line>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
Todd, it is all happening.

</line>


<line>
Hooray. And you know I don't

throw that word aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d lightly.

</line>


<line>
All right. Now we just got to

make sure we focus

and actually follow through

on this.

</line>


<line>
I'd feel awful

if this great idea fell apart

because we got distracted

by something else,

as we are often wont to do.

</line>


<line>
Wait, did you say

you feel awful or falafel?

</line>


<line>
I said, "Feel awful,"

but tell me more

about this falafel idea.

</line>


<line>
Falafel or fawaffle?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dance music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack, isn't this exciting?

Smoodies, right?

</line>


<line>
Do you even know

what a smoodie is?

</line>


<line>
I think it's some kind of

an adult onesie.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

I'm trying new things.

</line>


<line>
I'm single again,

and I'm loving it.

</line>


<line>
- Let me repeat--

- Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Vincent. Well, you've got

some nerve showing your face.

</line>


<line>
- I've got half a mind to--

- No, let me talk.

</line>


<line>
I had a attitude problem,

but then I took a timeout,

and I thought about what I did.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be a big man.

</line>


<line>
But sometimes the biggest thing

a man can do is tell the truth.

</line>


<line>
And the truth about me is,

I... I--

</line>


<line>
- Okay, here we go.

- I love you.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Oh, Vincent.

</line>


<line>
Let's go feel grass

between our toes.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- All right.

</line>


<line>
You're a better man

than I could ever be.

</line>


<line>
I wish my boyfriend

was that mature.

</line>


<line>
- [groans]

- [cell phone vibrates]

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

</line>


<line>
I got some news

about "<name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat."

</line>


<line>
- What's up?

<ital>- Garfield's out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He got into

some sort of accident.

</line>


<line>
An All Hallows' Eve store

in January?

</line>


<line>
How fiendishly droll.

Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, bother.

</line>


<line>
The clumsy bastard

broke every bone in his body,

and now we got to find

a new lead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Studio</name> wants to go yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g,

but I was thinking we'd get

someone a little more

BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
What? Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
You're the only one with

enough grit to play the part,

and we can age you down in post,

but I'm gonna tell you now,

not gonna put up with

any woe-is-me bullshit

or diva histrionics.

</line>


<line>
I get enough of that

from my ex-wife

along with newspaper clippings

about gluten.

</line>


<line>
God, we get it, Marla.

Gluten.

</line>


<line>
But if you want to make a movie,

and you're ready to work...

</line>


<line>
I am. I will.

I can. I do.

</line>


<line>
Great. You got one month

to get in shape.

</line>


<line>
You need to lose 50 po<name type="ORG">un</name>ds

and then gain back 20.

</line>


<line>
- And, BoJack...

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Don't ever call this number.

</line>


<line>
If I want to talk,

I'll call you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hey.

- Hey.

</line>


<line>
Not big on parties, huh?

</line>


<line>
Nah. I never know what to do

with my hands.

</line>


<line>
I think I just got cast

in <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- That's amazing.

- It's everything I ever wanted.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.

- What do I do now?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's the problem

with life, right?

</line>


<line>
Either you know what you want,

and you don't get what you want,

or get what you want, and then

you don't know what you want.

</line>


<line>
- Well, that's stupid.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if this makes you

more or less excited,

but I actually decided to take

a job on the <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat</ital> movie

as a character consultant.

</line>


<line>
Wow, so we're gonna be

working together again.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I hope

you don't get sick of me.

</line>


<line>
I don't think

that's gonna happen.

</line>


<line>
- Is it weird I took this job?

- Why would it be weird?

</line>


<line>
You literally wrote the book

on <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know. I just--

When I first moved to L.A...

</line>


<line>
I thought I was gonna be doing

really important work.

</line>


<line>
You know, writing stuff

that makes a difference.

</line>


<line>
But then you kind of fall into

one thing and then another...

</line>


<line>
Well, you've got time.

There's always later, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I guess

there's always later.

</line>


<line>
Do you remember

the last time I saw you?

</line>


<line>
You asked me if I thought you

were a good person deep down?

</line>


<line>
Do I remember that?

Yeah, vaguely.

</line>


<line>
You caught me off guard.

I didn't know what to say.

</line>


<line>
Well, do you think

I'm a good person... deep down?

</line>


<line>
That's the thing. I don't

think I believe in deep down.

</line>


<line>
I kind of think all you are

is just the things that you do.

</line>


<line>
- Well, that's depressing.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
For what it's worth,

</line>


<line>
I think your writing

does make a difference.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

</line>


<line>
I really wanted you

to like me, Diane.

</line>


<line>
I know.
