<ital>[polite applause]</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>[male TV host] When we booked you</ital>

<ital>for this show,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you'd just won the Triple Crown,</ital>

<ital>but then just this week,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I open up the newspaper,</ital>

<ital>and look at this...</ital>

</line>


<line>
"Secretariat

Under Investigation."

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do

with that?

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's

a different Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha ha ha. No,

but seriously, folks,

there is no truth

to these allegations.

</line>


<line>
I have never bet on

horse racing,

and I certainly did not bet on

my own races.

</line>


<line>
Although I did bet the network's

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give your show

back to Joey Bishop.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">O--</name> <name type="PERSON">ho</name> <name type="PERSON">ho</name>-- kay.

</line>


<line>
We get letters here on the show,

and one particular letter,

for you, actually, struck

a chord with our producers.

</line>


<line>
This is from <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> H.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is nine years old.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> writes,

"Dear Secretariat,

</line>


<line>
I am a horse just like you.

</line>


<line>
I like to watch racing,

and you are my favorite racer."

</line>


<line>
Smart kid.

</line>


<line>
"When I grow up,

I want to be just like you,

and I think

I'm on the right track.

</line>


<line>
Get it? Track,

because horses r<name type="ORG">un</name> on tracks,

and you are a horse,

and I am a horse.

</line>


<line>
Do you get it? Do you

get my joke about the track?"

</line>


<line>
Okay, there's

a whole page of this.

</line>


<line>
Should I write him back

and tell him I get it?

</line>


<line>
He goes on,

"My question for you is,

</line>


<line>
I am a good kid,

and I like to play,

and I like to go to school,

but sometimes I get sad.

</line>


<line>
What do you do

when you get sad?

</line>


<line>
How do you not be sad?

Sincerely, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>."

</line>


<line>
That's a great letter.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, when I was your age,

I got sad.

</line>


<line>
A lot.

</line>


<line>
I didn't come from

such a great home,

but one day, I started running,

and that seemed to make sense,

so then I just kept running.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, when you get sad,

you r<name type="ORG">un</name> straight ahead

and you keep running forward,

no matter what.

</line>


<line>
There are people in your life

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> try to

hold you back, slow you down,

but you don't let them.

</line>


<line>
Don't you stop running and

don't you ever look behind you.

</line>


<line>
There's nothing for you

behind you.

</line>


<line>
All that exists is what's ahead.

</line>


<line>
<ital>[man 1] Good morning, Louisville.</ital>

<ital>It's August 22nd, 1973.</ital>

</line>

<ital>from competition.</ital>

<line>
<ital>[man 1] It's a disgrace is what it is.</ital>

<ital>This is the '70s.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You can't cheat in sports</ital>

<ital>and get away with it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>[man 2] You know, I think it</ital>

<ital>just goes to show you,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you can be the fastest runner</ital>

<ital>in the world,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but you can't outr<name type="ORG">un</name> the truth.</ital>

<line>
And the Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>

for Best Comedy or Musical

</line>


<line>
goes to <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>,

my friend,

</line>


<line>
for his book <ital>One Trick Pony.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> This is a first win

for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>

and his first appearance

at the <name type="ORG">Globe</name> ceremony

</line>


<line>
since his forced removal

in 1992

</line>


<line>
after he exchanged blows

with Sir Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name>.

</line>


<line>
Wow, what an honor.

</line>


<line>
I have to thank

the Hollywoo Foreign Press.

</line>


<line>
I feel like I should mention

</line>


<line>
that my book

was not a comedy or a musical.

</line>


<line>
Do you guys actually watch

the movies you give awards to?

</line>


<line>
'Cause I kind of

get the sense that--

</line>


<line>
Also, my book was not a movie.

You do know that, right?

</line>


<line>
We're friends.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the response to this

book has been incredible.

</line>


<line>
These last three months

have been really amazing.

</line>


<line>
You know, a lot of people

said to me,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"You</name> sure you want to

publish this book?

</line>


<line>
It's pretty personal."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "If I can make

just one person out there

</line>


<line>
feel a little less alone,

then it's all worth it."

</line>


<line>
And they said,

"That's really brave."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Well, I'm not one

to call myself brave,

but since you said it,

yeah, I am."

</line>


<line>
- After-party at my restaurant!

- [cheering, applause]

</line>


<line>
Why did I say after-party

at my restaurant?

</line>


<line>
I do not want to throw a party.

</line>


<line>
It did seem unlike you. I'm

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go get some cotton candy.

</line>


<line>
- You want some?

- No.

</line>


<line>
- Yes.

- There he is, man of the hour.

</line>


<line>
- Hello, other grown up.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, cheer up, dummy.

Your book is a huge success.

</line>


<line>
Everybody loves you.

You just won a Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>.

</line>


<line>
If you can't be happy tonight,

maybe you'll

never be happy again.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, is that

supposed to be encouraging?

</line>


<line>
- Because it's super-bleak.

- <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name> Adultman...

how are things

at the old nine to five?

</line>


<line>
Good. I went to

the stock market today.

</line>


<line>
I did a business.

</line>


<line>
I keep telling him

he works too hard.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, let's get away

from the rat race.

</line>


<line>
Take a cruise someplace

wet and <name type="NORP">Latin</name>.

</line>


<line>
I mean, can you imagine

this body in a swimsuit?

</line>


<line>
- I literally cannot.

- <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, let's do a lap.

</line>


<line>
Have you met <name type="PERSON">Brendan</name> Fraser?

</line>


<line>
I feel like you two

would love each other.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Easy, easy.

</line>


<line>
I got to hand it to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
This book has been everything

she said it would be.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, she knows

what she's doing.

</line>


<line>
How is <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>? I haven't

seen her since...

</line>


<line>
Well, I haven't seen her

in a while.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, the book's

been huge for her, too.

</line>


<line>
She's practically as famous

as I am now.

</line>


<line>
- We're like the <name type="PERSON">Brangelinas</name>.

- Well, I'm happy she's happy.

</line>


<line>
- And how are you?

- Well, it's been really hard--

</line>


<line>
Erica, is that you? W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>

let you out of the burn ward?

</line>


<line>
- Get over here, you.

- Uhh.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me. I just have to tell

you how much I love your book.

</line>


<line>
It's so naked and honest

and revealing.

</line>


<line>
It is? Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
I love the part about

how you became famous

so you could be constantly

surrounded by distraction

and wouldn't have to be

alone with yourself.

</line>


<line>
I thought that was

a really profound observation.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, definitely.

So profound.

</line>


<line>
- Do you want to get out of here?

- What?

</line>


<line>
Come back to my place,

maybe get a little more naked,

</line>


<line>
- honest and revealing?

- Oh, no. No, thanks.

</line>


<line>
- What about you?

- Yeah, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman moaning and panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Oh-- Whoa.

- [screams]

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

- You still friends with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Heard you two

were on the outs.

</line>


<line>
You <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> write another book

about it?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you looking at

some oranges?

</line>


<line>
You <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> write a book

about those oranges, huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hello.

<ital>- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name> St. Claire here,

famed billionaire

philanthropist/adventurer.

</line>


<line>
Please, hold your applause.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- You can applaud a little.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
I got your number

from <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name> Penguin.

</line>


<line>
I'm looking for a journalist

to follow me around

for a few months

and document my daring exploits

aiding ravaged communities

and displaced people.

</line>


<line>
- Ssss.

- Wow, that sounds amazing.

</line>


<line>
But that's not usually

the kind of thing I write about.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, if you can make people

care about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>,

surely you can make them

care about emaciated orphans

with missing limbs.

</line>


<line>
We need to wake people up.

</line>


<line>
Well, I am a morning person.

</line>


<line>
I hope you mean mourning

with a "u,"

because, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

this is deadly serious.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, of course.

</line>


<line>
You want to spend

three months in <name type="GPE">Sudan</name>?

</line>


<line>
Not just there. We're also

going to <name type="GPE">Haiti</name> and Thailand

and <name type="GPE">Uganda</name> and <name type="GPE">Chechnya</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can't you do all that in <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>?

</line>


<line>
I want to do something

important.

</line>


<line>
I want to help people

and do good work

and sleep on the ground

and poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
Honey, nobody wants to

poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I do. Maybe

I want to poop in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
If you want to poop in a

bucket, we can get you a bucket.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to go all the way

the Chechnylavakia.

</line>


<line>
Am I saying that right?

</line>


<line>
It's not just

the pooping in a bucket.

</line>


<line>
I think it might be good for me

to get out of <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>

for a little bit.

</line>


<line>
Sweetie, you know I support

you, whatever you want to do,

but you're not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> find

what you're looking for

in these awful made-up places.

</line>


<line>
The universe

is a cruel, uncaring void.

</line>


<line>
The key to being happy

isn't a search for meaning.

</line>


<line>
It's to just keep yourself busy

with unimportant nonsense,

and eventually, you'll be dead.

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess

I can keep my options open.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whistles gleefully]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, can I ask you something?

</line>


<line>
Did <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name> seem extra weird

to you last night?

</line>


<line>
Well, he's still three kids

in a trench coat, so, no.

</line>


<line>
We're going through a rough

patch. It's hard, you know.

</line>


<line>
He's works a full time job

at the business factory,

so when he gets home,

he just wants to unwind

by watching R-rated movies.

</line>


<line>
Ahh, I thought I was ready

for a real adult relationship,

</line>


<line>
- but--

- [snores]

</line>


<line>
Enough about me.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you are on fire.

</line>


<line>
Oh, are we talking

about me again?

</line>


<line>
We have an offer on the table

for you to play the bad guy

in the new <name type="PERSON">James Bond</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Ehh.

- I agree. Total garbage.

</line>


<line>
But this, it's a new drama

from <name type="ORG">the Coen Brothers</name>.

</line>


<line>
A western about a one-horse town

and you're the horse.

</line>


<line>
Hello, <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>. What do you think?

</line>


<line>
I think now's the time

to finally make "Secretariat."

</line>


<line>
Really? Now? Aren't you

a little, um, very too old?

</line>


<line>
You asked me what I wanted

to do. That's what I want.

</line>


<line>
That's all I've ever wanted,

and if I can't get it now,

then all of this

has been for nothing.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fish. Of course!

</line>


<line>
Why would you ever

make things easy for me

when instead you could make

things incredibly difficult?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Laura</name>, clear out

the rest of my day.

</line>


<line>
I have to push a boulder

up a hill,

and then have it roll over me

time and time again

with no regard

for my well-being.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Attagirl</name>.

</line>


<line>
All right, Todd. <name type="ORG">PB</name> Livin'

needs a new project.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks</name>

has been an enormous success,

but I got into this game

to make movies,

so let's make a movie.

</line>


<line>
Well, I got a stack

of great scripts here.

</line>


<line>
Any one of them

would make a wonderful movie.

</line>


<line>
Fantastic.

</line>


<line>
But I also have this other

non-movie-related idea.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, let's hear

the other idea.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I was

heading down <name type="GPE">Wilshire</name>,

and I saw this empty

store front, and I thought,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"You</name> know what

this world needs?"

</line>


<line>
Edge of my seat over here.

</line>


<line>
A store where people can buy

Halloween stuff.

</line>


<line>
Halloween store.

Feel like that's been done.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, in October,

but how come your never see

a Halloween store in January?

</line>


<line>
- It's an untapped market.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
A Halloween store

that's open year-round.

</line>


<line>
- No, no. Just January.

- Brilliant.

</line>


<line>
That's the kind of idea

that wins Golden Globes.

</line>


<line>
I actually think the time

is right for "Secretariat,"

so what do you want to play,

like, Secretariat's dad

or his grandfather, maybe like

an elderly witch doctor

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> puts a curse on him

or something?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lenny</name>, look, I know

I'm a little long in the tooth,

but I think that you

more than anyone

would know

not to count out an old pro.

</line>


<line>
Don't play the ageism card

with me, kid.

</line>


<line>
I've laid farts that lasted

longer than your entire career.

</line>


<line>
But Secretariat was dead at 27,

so w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> we kidding here?

</line>


<line>
Just set the project up

and give me an audition.

</line>


<line>
- That's all I ask.

- All right.

</line>


<line>
You got yourself

a "go" picture, kid.

</line>


<line>
And by you, I mean me.

And by "go" picture,

</line>


<line>
I mean I'll make some phone

calls, we'll see what I can do.

</line>


<line>
And by kid,

I mean middle-aged adult.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whispers]</nonVerbComm> Shh. No, no, no.

Put it here. Put it here.

</line>


<line>
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.

- <name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Has this ever happened to you?

- Has what ever happened to me?

</line>


<line>
- Todd?

- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

Why are you talking like that?

</line>


<line>
Todd, I just got

a phenomenal idea

for a Halloween costume.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you and I dash over

to the store right quick

and spend some hard-earned

American money?

</line>


<line>
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter,

didn't you hear?

</line>


<line>
It's January, and

the Halloween store won't open

for another nine months.

</line>


<line>
But I want satisfaction now.

</line>


<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

</line>


<line>
Not to anyone ever

at any time.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>. We give you

Halloween in January,

a truly immersive

Halloween experience

for the rest of us.

</line>


<line>
Halloween in January?

Please elaborate.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but before I do,

tell the audience.

</line>


<line>
- Have we ever met before?

- Never.

</line>


<line>
Well, according to facts,

there's more suicides in January

</line>


<line>
- than any other month.

- I'm getting pretty close over here.

</line>


<line>
Also, there's less

Halloween stores. Coincidence?

</line>


<line>
Wow, I'm convinced.

This store could save lives.

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

When your powers combine...

you are somehow even more stupid

than the sum of your stupids.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- Go on.

</line>


<line>
You stop encouraging him

and you stop encouraging him.

</line>


<line>
The two of you

are playing with fire.

</line>


<line>
A fire called

Having a Good Idea.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe

a fire called Friendship.

</line>


<line>
- Fires aren't called things.

- What about the <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> fire?

</line>


<line>
Or Fire Island.

</line>


<line>
- Or <name type="PERSON">Gabe</name>.

- W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Gabe</name>?

</line>


<line>
Just a fire I met once.

Named him <name type="PERSON">Gabe</name>.

</line>


<line>
- He sounds delightful.

- He was. Good guy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Business, business, business.

Is that all you ever think about?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

</line>


<line>
What's under that coat,

<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>?

</line>


<line>
- You need to let me in.

- Not right now.

</line>


<line>
I have to call

the guy at the office

and take the car to the place.

</line>


<line>
It's always guys in places

with you.

</line>


<line>
You know, I thought

I wanted to date a real adult,

but I'm actually

<name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung at heart.

</line>


<line>
I need to feel the grass

between my toes.

</line>


<line>
I want to wear jeans.

I want to dance.

</line>


<line>
- That's baby stuff.

- No, <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>.

</line>


<line>
There's more to being an adult

than just work and business

and the tall-person rides at

Disneyland. I want to have f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
There has to be a difference

between monogamy and monotony.

</line>


<line>
What's mahumanunny?

</line>


<line>
Well, clearly we had

a different understanding

of what this was.

</line>


<line>
I'd like to be an adult about

this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

</line>


<line>
I think you should just go,

just git. Get out of my life.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Could I have another soda?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you know

<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> Jannings, our director.

</line>


<line>
I really appreciate you

giving me this opportunity.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Secretariat

was kind of my hero as a kid.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, he was

a lot of people's hero.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know, here was a guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> had everything--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know the story.

I'm the director.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>, be nice.

</line>


<line>
She's just cranky because

she's already seen 30 people

read for this today,

and we are all so goddamn sick

of seeing auditions,

so whenever you're ready.

</line>


<line>
Just jump right in.

</line>


<line>
Great. Let's get to it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stilted]</nonVerbComm> Hey,

ain't you that horse

</line>


<line>
- that won all them races?

- Not today, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
Today I'm just a customer

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants a warm slice of pie.

</line>


<line>
Can I ask you a question?

</line>


<line>
When you're out there

on that there racetrack,

</line>


<line>
- what are you running from?

- You want to know the truth?

</line>


<line>
Nothing.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's running

from something, sugar.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm running from nothing.

I'm terrified of nothing.

</line>


<line>
People come up to me,

they want my autograph,

they want my picture.

</line>


<line>
They think they recognize

something in me,

and I want to be that person

they think I am, but I'm not.

</line>


<line>
They see a greatness in me, and

they mistake it for goodness,

but I... I know

there's nothing there.

</line>


<line>
As fast as I r<name type="ORG">un</name>,

I can't get way from that.

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- Wow.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I think I speak

for everyone when I say--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> Garfield said yes.

</line>


<line>
- We have our Secretariat.

- We got <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> Garfield?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

it's the best day of my life.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Lenny</name>]</nonVerbComm> You don't say no

to Spider-Man.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>]</nonVerbComm> This movie

is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be amazing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>...

</line>


<line>
Garfield!

</line>


<line>
Now, the pills

will give you nightmares--

</line>


<line>
I mean, just horrifying--

but the malaria

will give you death,

so you're going to want to

take the pills, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Uh-huh.

- Hold on.

</line>


<line>
A mosquito got into my tent.

What do you want?

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone vibrates]

- Hello?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, it's Princess Carolyn,

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s agent.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are.

</line>


<line>
I'm the pink cat, the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> used to date <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
We've met a lot of times.

You came to my wedding.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Listen,</ital>

<ital>the Turteltaub Company</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is making a movie</ital>

<ital>about Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And since you're such an expert,

they want to bring you on board

as a character consultant.

</line>


<line>
What does that mean?

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's the cushiest job

in the world.

</line>


<line>
You sit in a fancy chair

and eat pastries all day.

</line>


<line>
And then once a week, you say,

"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I've already

been offered this other thing.

</line>


<line>
And did you know

there are orphans in <name type="GPE">Sudan</name>--

</line>


<line>
You take this job, you can buy

all the orphans you want.

</line>


<line>
No, I don't want to buy them.

</line>


<line>
Look, if you really

want to help people,

it doesn't hurt to have

a little money in your pocket.

</line>


<line>
Take the job now,

help the orphans later.

</line>


<line>
- There's always later.

- Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Okay, talk it over

with your husband.

</line>


<line>
I got to go

get my whiskers trimmed.

</line>


<line>
I r<name type="ORG">un</name> into walls for days,

but I look hot.

</line>


<line>
- How's the pie here?

- Not good.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll take all you got.

</line>


<line>
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl

with some bourbon

</line>


<line>
- and bring me a ladle.

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, we notice you've been

pretty down in the dumps lately,

but we have something that we

think is going to cheer you up.

</line>


<line>
It's an exciting

new business venture

that's equal parts

new and exciting.

</line>


<line>
Another one? What happened

to your Halloween store?

</line>


<line>
- What now?

- Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
The Halloween store.

</line>


<line>
We took the floor out

because Mr. Peanutbutter

kept scratching up the hardwood,

and then-- Did we ever get

the new floor installed?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Halloween? In January?

</line>


<line>
What a great ide-- Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Anyway, now we're

all about smoodies.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Smoodies.

</line>


<line>
You're saying smoothies,

right? Smoothies.

</line>


<line>
No. Smoodies.

</line>


<line>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand it.

How do you drink a mood?

</line>


<line>
- Like a smoothie.

- So it is a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
No, it's a smoodie--

A mood that you drink.

</line>


<line>
- How do you drink a mood?

- Like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
But do you buy it in a store?

What're the physical attributes?

</line>


<line>
We haven't worked out

all the kinks yet,

but the important thing is

we've gone public,

and we want you to get in on

the ground floor.

</line>


<line>
See, that's the problem

with all your ideas--

they don't have ground floors.

</line>


<line>
Finally, a Halloween store

for the rest of-- Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Hello.

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

our launch party's tonight,

</line>


<line>
- and we'd love it if you came.

- We spared no expense...

that's how confident we are

in our product.

</line>


<line>
- Your product-- Smoodies.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Wait, did you say smoodies

or smoothies?

</line>


<line>
Because we only make--

Which one do we make?

</line>


<line>
I'd like to think

the smoodies make us.

</line>


<line>
Ahh, I can tell by your tone

that that was something smart.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[hip-hop music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Smoodie</name> keychain?

- <name type="PERSON">Smoodie</name> cozy?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Smoodie</name> bottle opener?

</line>


<line>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</line>


<line>
Todd, it is all happening.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>. And you know I don't

throw that word around lightly.

</line>


<line>
All right. Now we just got to

make sure we focus

and actually follow through

on this.

</line>


<line>
I'd feel awful

if this great idea fell apart

because we got distracted

by something else,

as we are often wont to do.

</line>


<line>
Wait, did you say

you feel awful or falafel?

</line>


<line>
I said, "Feel awful,"

but tell me more

about this falafel idea.

</line>


<line>
Falafel or fawaffle?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dance music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, isn't this exciting?

Smoodies, right?

</line>


<line>
Do you even know

what a smoodie is?

</line>


<line>
I think it's some kind of

an adult onesie.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

I'm trying new things.

</line>


<line>
I'm single again,

and I'm loving it.

</line>


<line>
- Let me repeat--

- Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>. Well, you've got

some nerve showing your face.

</line>


<line>
- I've got half a mind to--

- No, let me talk.

</line>


<line>
I had a attitude problem,

but then I took a timeout,

and I thought about what I did.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be a big man.

</line>


<line>
But sometimes the biggest thing

a man can do is tell the truth.

</line>


<line>
And the truth about me is,

I... I--

</line>


<line>
- Okay, here we go.

- I love you.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Oh, <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>.

</line>


<line>
Let's go feel grass

between our toes.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- All right.

</line>


<line>
You're a better man

than I could ever be.

</line>


<line>
I wish my boyfriend

was that mature.

</line>


<line>
- [groans]

- [cell phone vibrates]

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, it's <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> Jannings.

</line>


<line>
I got some news

about "Secretariat."

</line>


<line>
- What's up?

<ital>- Garfield's out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He got into

some sort of accident.

</line>


<line>
An All Hallows' Eve store

in January?

</line>


<line>
How fiendishly droll.

Aah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thud]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, bother.

</line>


<line>
The clumsy bastard

broke every bone in his body,

and now we got to find

a new lead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Studio</name> wants to go <name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung,

but I was thinking we'd get

someone a little more

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
What? Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
You're the only one with

enough grit to play the part,

and we can age you down in post,

but I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell you now,

not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> put up with

any woe-is-me bullshit

or diva histrionics.

</line>


<line>
I get enough of that

from my ex-wife

along with newspaper clippings

about gluten.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, we get it, Marla.

Gluten.

</line>


<line>
But if you want to make a movie,

and you're ready to work...

</line>


<line>
I am. I will.

I can. I do.

</line>


<line>
Great. You got one month

to get in shape.

</line>


<line>
You need to lose 50 pounds

and then gain back 20.

</line>


<line>
- And, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>...

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Don't ever call this number.

</line>


<line>
If I want to talk,

I'll call you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hey.

- Hey.

</line>


<line>
Not big on parties, huh?

</line>


<line>
Nah. I never know what to do

with my hands.

</line>


<line>
I think I just got cast

in <ital>Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- That's amazing.

- It's everything I ever wanted.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.

- What do I do now?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's the problem

with life, right?

</line>


<line>
Either you know what you want,

and you don't get what you want,

or get what you want, and then

you don't know what you want.

</line>


<line>
- Well, that's stupid.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if this makes you

more or less excited,

but I actually decided to take

a job on the <ital>Secretariat</ital> movie

as a character consultant.

</line>


<line>
Wow, so we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

working together again.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I hope

you don't get sick of me.

</line>


<line>
I don't think

that's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen.

</line>


<line>
- Is it weird I took this job?

- Why would it be weird?

</line>


<line>
You literally wrote the book

on Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know. I just--

When I first moved to <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>..

</line>


<line>
I thought I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be doing

really important work.

</line>


<line>
You know, writing stuff

that makes a difference.

</line>


<line>
But then you kind of fall into

one thing and then another...

</line>


<line>
Well, you've got time.

There's always later, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I guess

there's always later.

</line>


<line>
Do you remember

the last time I saw you?

</line>


<line>
You asked me if I thought you

were a good person deep down?

</line>


<line>
Do I remember that?

Yeah, vaguely.

</line>


<line>
You caught me off guard.

I didn't know what to say.

</line>


<line>
Well, do you think

I'm a good person... deep down?

</line>


<line>
That's the thing. I don't

think I believe in deep down.

</line>


<line>
I kind of think all you are

is just the things that you do.

</line>


<line>
- Well, that's depressing.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
For what it's worth,

</line>


<line>
I think your writing

does make a difference.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

</line>


<line>
I really wanted you

to like me, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
I know.
