<line>
- Hey, buddy, big day.

- [moans] No.

</line>


<line>
- Big premiere day.

- Stop.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat </ital>in theaters now.

</line>


<line>
- How exciting.

- Please stop.

</line>


<line>
People are seeing your movie,

forming opinions, judging you,

all over the co<name type="ORG">un</name>try.

</line>


<line>
- What are you doing?

- Or not. <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe nobody's seeing it.

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't it be weird

if literally nobody saw your movie?

</line>


<line>
How do I get out of this conversation?

</line>


<line>
Just think: by this time tomorrow,

we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he air crackles with possibilities.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, good lord. [groaning]

- Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
It's all over. My career is gone.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

</line>


<line>
Wasn't <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat </ital>a big hit

at the <name type="LOC">Pacific Ocean</name> Film Festival?

</line>


<line>
Critics called it,

"<name type="PERSON">Gurgle glub glub</name> blub blub."

</line>


<line>
Festivals don't matter, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
It's so you can get some leaves

on your poster.

</line>


<line>
But this is the real world now.

</line>


<line>
If this doesn't hit big this weekend--

</line>


<line>
- It's-- Oh! Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>. [<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]

- Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay.

</line>


<line>
- [p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne ringing]

- [<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps and moans]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, the <name type="LOC">East Coast</name> box office is in.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat </ital>is, wait for it...

</line>


<line>
- a huge success!

- Why would you make me wait for it?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a terrible time

for a "wait for it."

</line>


<line>
Do you know what this means?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're no longer just some <name type="PERSON">T</name>V actor

they threw into a movie,

</line>


<line>
<ital>you're a bona fide movie...</ital>

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you feel?

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat took up most of the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur,

</line>


<line>
but we do still have a little time

to hear from <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, I think you are great.

</line>


<line>
- Is that all?

- I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I'm not always good at using words

to describe emotions.

</line>


<line>
Aren't you a writer?

</line>


<line>

- Aah!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat gentle so<name type="ORG">un</name>d tells us the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name> has set

on our time together this week.

</line>


<line>
But I remind you

of the importance of co<name type="PERSON">mm</name><name type="ORG">un</name>ication.

</line>


<line>
It's the very blade of the bobsled.

</line>


<line>
I'm not singling out either one of you,

</line>


<line>
but I think for the next time,

some people here

</line>


<line>
might want to work on putting

their t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughts and feelings into words,

</line>


<line>
as a writer does.

</line>


<line>
- M<name type="PERSON">mm</name>?

- <name type="PERSON">Mm-<name type="PERSON">mm</name>m</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Ah.

- [sighs]

</line>


<line>
I settled on a company dental plan.

</line>


<line>
It's called, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he tooth, the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le tooth,

and nothing but the tooth."

</line>


<line>
- Seemed comprehensive.

- Not "tooth" shabby, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
- [laughing]

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
I also wanted to talk to you,

if this is a good time,

and it is, because you have exactly

nine minutes before your meeting

on <ital>Captain Hooker 2:</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name> Ho Ho Ho and A <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ttle Of <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>oty.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, what's up?

</line>


<line>
I've taken on duties beyond the scope

of my original contract.

</line>


<line>
- I think I've proven my worth.

- Are you asking for a raise?

</line>


<line>
A more ele<name type="PERSON">ga</name>nt solution might involve

an ownership position in the company.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught I'd ask for 15 percent stake,

you'd co<name type="ORG">un</name>ter with five,

we'd settle on ten.

</line>


<line>
- Well, then, it's settled.

- I'll draw up the paperwork.

</line>


<line>
Speaking of paper,

<name type="PERSON">Piper Perabo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pauley Perrette</name>

need to push back the pitch on

the <ital>Princess and the Pauper </ital>project.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have a night off tonight.

- A night off?

</line>


<line>
- When's the last time that happened?

- It hasn't.

</line>


<line>
- Can I help you with anything else?

- Get me a date for tonight.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ke that three dates.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows when I'll get another night off?

</line>


<line>
I do. And you won't.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, my good man.

</line>


<line>
My movie, starring me,

the movie star, just opened.

</line>


<line>
We'd like to sit at the bar.

Drinks on the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Of course, Mr. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

Right away, Mr. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

<line>
Mr. <name type="GPE">Sutherland</name>, I'm going to have

to ask you to give up your seat

for a movie star and his companion.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Bea</name>t it, <name type="PERSON">Kiefer</name>.

- [scoffs]

</line>


<line>
Wow!

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey love you here.

- Everybody loves a movie star, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get a lot of love.

I want you by my side,

soaking up the spillover

and feasting on my discarded leftovers.

</line>


<line>
So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>j.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>onight, we're riding

a rocket straight into the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u won't get left on the la<name type="ORG">un</name>chpad

just because nobody knows your name.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd? <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>?

- I think you mean <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

- <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>. Why do people keep

saying names that aren't my name?

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen you since high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look great. I love the hat.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks. What brings you here?

</line>


<line>
My dumb best friend's getting married,

so I'm here for the rehearsal dinner.

</line>


<line>
Why is everybody not talking about me

for a moment? <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is concerning.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

- Yeah, duh.

</line>


<line>
I loved <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.</ital>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is, like, my favorite s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?</ital>

- No, <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It was so dumb. It was the best.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you?

- I mean, it was the worst.

</line>


<line>
- But that's what made it so good.

- Yeah, I got it.

</line>


<line>
I was laughing at it

because it was so bad, do you <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're being very clear.

- I feel like I'm not articulating.

</line>


<line>
My enjoyment didn't come

from a place of sincere admiration.

</line>


<line>
It was more like,

"What an ill-conceived television s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> made t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se terrible c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ices?

I can't stop watching."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to keep--

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks. I love you.

By which I mean, you're terrible.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld get back

to this stupid rehearsal dinner.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, it was really great to see you.

</line>


<line>
Wait, did you say there's a wedding?

</line>


<line>
- I said "rehearsal dinner," but--

- W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a! We gotta crash that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ring regular people love it

when movie stars s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up

and drink their alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey jizz their pants for that shit.

</line>


<line>
- I don't know, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

- I'm sorry, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. Are you a movie star?

</line>


<line>
I did narrate a <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>zda co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial.

F<name type="ORG">un</name>ny story <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w that came together.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not the time for one

of your weird stories that go nowhere.

</line>


<line>
- We've got a wedding to crash.

- It's a rehearsal dinner.

</line>


<line>
It just doesn't come easy for me,

like it does for you.

</line>


<line>
Co<name type="PERSON">mm</name><name type="ORG">un</name>ication is a process.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why we're going to Dr. <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat, and there was a <name type="ORG">Groupon</name>.

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had a model growing up.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use filled with love,

parents w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> said nice things to you,

and the beautiful verdant hillsides

of the <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name>.

</line>


<line>
I didn't have <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name>.

I had the Isthmus of Ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>les.

</line>


<line>
I keep telling you

we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go visit the old co<name type="ORG">un</name>try.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u'd love it up there.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's so much to smell.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's weird.

</line>


<line>
I just got a text from <name type="PERSON">Alex</name>i Brosefino.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he famous movie star and man about town?

</line>


<line>
He wants me to come to his <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

and party with his friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="ORG">Snatch Batch</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alex</name>i Brosefino wants <ital>you </ital>to party

with the <name type="ORG">Snatch Batch</name>?

</line>


<line>
He's one of our clients.

I met him a couple weeks ago.

</line>


<line>
We talked about me

<name type="ORG">Instagram</name>ming one of his parties.

</line>


<line>
I didn't think he actually wanted me

to do it tonight.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait. <name type="PERSON">T</name>onight?

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ped we could snuggle up

on the couch and watch <ital><name type="PERSON">Bo</name>nes.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't think that s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w's about

what you think it's about.

</line>


<line>
Besides, I have to go.

It's for work. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
It's fine. But you'll call me

if you're out late, right?

</line>


<line>
- Yes. I'll call you.

- Okay. Have a good time.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! I'm sure I won't.

</line>


<line>
Cool guys like that

take me back to high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol

and I end up feeling

like a huge nerd over a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only kind of nerd you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld feel like

is <name type="PERSON">ho</name>n-nerd that he selected you.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, I made reservations

for you tonight at <name type="PERSON">Ele</name>fante.

</line>


<line>
- Reservations?

- For your dates.

</line>


<line>
One at seven,

one at 8:30, and one at ten.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u actually got me three dates?

</line>


<line>
- I was joking.

- I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I sometimes have trouble reading tone.

</line>


<line>
Once I spent 45 minutes

at a fascinating lecture

at the Apollo <name type="PERSON">T</name>heater

before I realized it was a comedy routine.

</line>


<line>
I can't go on three dates.

Can we reschedule two of them?

</line>


<line>
It will be a long time

before you get another night off.

</line>


<line>
Especially since you have t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se lawyers

coming next week to change light bulbs.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I just realized now

that was also a joke.

</line>


<line>
As the father of one of the brides,

I just wanted to take a moment to--

</line>


<line>
<ital>Buenas noches, amigos.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Let's get blasted. Right?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

<line>
- Ooh.

<line>
- Can I help you?

- I'm <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
- Um...

- I work for Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u texted me to come hang out

with you and your friends.

</line>


<line>
- I'm r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning out of things to say.

- Oh, yeah. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, no, of course. Come in, please.

</line>


<line>
- Holy shit. Is that a <name type="PERSON">Klimt</name>?

- Hey, guys, we got a guest.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, this is <name type="PERSON">Carl</name>os, <name type="PERSON">David</name>,

</line>


<line>
Ah, the famous <name type="ORG">Snatch Batch</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just a dumb name

some reporter came up with.

</line>


<line>
We don't actually call ourselves that.

</line>


<line>
We all have sex with a lot of women.

But w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares?

</line>


<line>
We also love getting br<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u might as well call us

<name type="ORG">the Br<name type="ORG">un</name>ch Batch</name>.

</line>


<line>
Or <name type="ORG">the Br<name type="ORG">un</name>ch B<name type="ORG">un</name>ch</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, <name type="PERSON">Carl</name>os,

that's why you're the f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny one.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is really good.

Write that one down.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, we get why the <name type="ORG">Casanova</name> narrative

is appealing and <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w it helps our brand.

</line>


<line>
- We're not complete idiots.

- Yeah, except for <name type="PERSON">Shits<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</name>.

</line>


<line>
- [blows raspberry]

- [laughing]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d one.

</line>


<line>
But within each man

lives a great multiplicity, right?

</line>


<line>
- Nobody is just one thing.

- Yeah, except for <name type="PERSON">Shits<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
- [nervous chuckle]

- Ah...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, we can make f<name type="ORG">un</name> of him

because, like, he's our friend.

</line>


<line>
I am so sorry, <name type="PERSON">Shits<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</name>.

But the modern era of automotive glass

be<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n when engineers

took two panes of laminated glass

and separated them

with a thin layer of PVB.

</line>


<line>
- Uh-huh.

- How about you? Are you in the industry?

</line>


<line>
- Yes, actually. I'm an agent.

- Agent?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you're in the entertainment industry.

</line>


<line>
When I said the industry,

I meant the auto glass industry.

</line>


<line>
We call our business the industry

because we think

we're more important than everybody else.

<name type="PERSON">Karen</name> and <name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha super well,

but I do know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w precious and rare it is

to find that one missing puzzle piece

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> completes you.

</line>


<line>
And when you know, you know.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know?

</line>


<line>
So congrats to the happy couple

for knowing.

</line>


<line>
Okay, as they say in the movie business,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a wrap on <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>."

</line>


<line>
Let's hear it

from some of these bridesmaids.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha, <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>.

[sing-song] <name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha... <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>...

</line>


<line>
On the way here, the driver stopped

in some weird parking lot

and asked if he could touch my hair.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's terrifying.

- I know.

</line>


<line>
It is a very popular ride-sharing app,

you'd think they could vet

their drivers better.

</line>


<line>
Which app is that?

</line>


<line>
I probably s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't say,

for le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l reasons.

</line>


<line>
I think we all know

which one I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what would solve

a lot of problems?

</line>


<line>
If there was a ride-share app for women

that only had women drivers.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is such a good idea, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u always did have such great ideas.

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what else would be cool?

</line>


<line>
A miniature cupcake g<name type="ORG">un</name>,

so you could s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot tiny cupcakes

into your mouth.

</line>


<line>
"Uh-oh! Is that guy

trying to kill himself?"

</line>


<line>
"Nope, just a cupcake g<name type="ORG">un</name>."

</line>


<line>
Wait, no, go back to your other idea.

</line>


<line>
- Which one?

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>he one about the women drivers.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha, and <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>.

[sobbing] <name type="PERSON">Karen</name> and <name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[dance music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
And my fo<name type="ORG">un</name>dation focuses

on clean water initiatives

and that's actually <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I met <name type="PERSON">Carl</name>os.

</line>


<line>
He patented a process

for ionic remineralization.

</line>


<line>
- It's crazy.

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Okay, enough s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p talk. Let's roll.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

- Oh, drug taking. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's cool. I'm cool.

</line>


<line>
- What is this, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lly?

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, some drug dealer from 2013

fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d a time machine

and <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve us this <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lly.

</line>


<line>
- Nobody does <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lly anymore.

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="ORG">Gush</name>.

</line>


<line>
What's <name type="ORG">Gush</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I get that

this is maybe not your usual scene.

</line>


<line>
- So don't feel like you have to do any--

- No, no, I can hang. Let's do drugs.

</line>


<line>
Let's put the drug in my mouth,

so I can trip or roll or gush or--

</line>


<line>
- [gulping]

- Oh, you all did it. Uh...

</line>


<line>
Here we go.

Oh, it doesn't hit right away, does it?

</line>


<line>
- No, it'll take a few minutes.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
So <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w'd you guys meet <name type="PERSON">Shits<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</name>?

</line>


<line>
We went to his <name type="PERSON">T</name>ED <name type="PERSON">T</name>alk.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it is so great

to finally date a woman my age.

</line>


<line>
- Yes.

- W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s comfortable in her own skin.

</line>


<line>
I always say, there's more than one way

for a cat... you know, to have skin.

</line>


<line>
And has come to terms

with not having children.

</line>


<line>
What makes you think

I don't want to have children?

</line>


<line>
Oh, come on.

What are you, serious? At your age?

</line>


<line>
Since when are you an expert

on w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can and cannot have children?

</line>


<line>
I'm a gynecologist.

I specialize in fertility.

</line>


<line>
I'd be happy to put you in the stirrups,

look at the old cat eggs.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ecch</name>! Not if you were the last albino

<name type="PERSON">rhino gyno</name> on the planet.

</line>


<line>
I'm the only albino <name type="PERSON">rhino gyno</name> I know.

</line>


<line>
- S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we get some wine?

- Oh, great. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're also a wine addict.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah!

</line>


<line>
So to do a soft la<name type="ORG">un</name>ch,

I think we'd only need about ten cars.

</line>


<line>
I could work out any bugs with the app.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u really know what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
So, do you think

your girlfriend would get jealous

if we started this project together, or...

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is so embarrassing for you,

but I actually don't have a girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a really weird assumption

for you to make.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look really dumb right now.

</line>


<line>
No, actually, I was kind of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping

you weren't seeing anybody.

</line>


<line>
I'm also not seeing anybody,

for what it's worth.

</line>


<line>
- Ohh.

- Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, you must be a real cool dude

if a movie star wants to hang out

with you for no reason.

</line>


<line>
Just wanted to give you

a key to the room I booked,

which nobody is in right now.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">Winkity</name> dinkity.

- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you two

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld just go see if the bed works.

</line>


<line>
A lot of these rooms have faulty beds.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a great idea.

- Uh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let me just finish

this cocktail real quick. [slurping]

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- All right, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. Yeah, go.

</line>


<line>
Ahh! Cool, I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get

one or two more drinks

and then we'll go check out that bed.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Emily</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Okay.

</line>


<line>
Um... hello, everybody. I was thinking

about what <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> said before.

</line>


<line>
About <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w when you know, you know.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sitting there,

and I'm thinking, "Do I know?"

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- I mean, I think I know.

</line>


<line>
But if you know when you know

and I only think that I know,

maybe that means that I don't know, right?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, boy.

- <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I love you, but I can't do this.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he wedding's off.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Emily</name>] It's a rehearsal dinner.

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
- [mic feedback]

- [sobbing]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's working.

Am I doing this wrong?

</line>


<line>
Am I doing drugs wrong?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alex</name>i, did you hear back

from that piece you texted?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Mm-<name type="PERSON">mm</name>m</name>! <name type="PERSON">Mm-<name type="PERSON">mm</name>m</name>.

- "<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat piece"?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat girl was <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t.

What was her name a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

</line>


<line>
Doesn't matter.

I mean, let's just enjoy ourselves, right?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

- What?

</line>


<line>
No, the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t girl. Her name was <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u saved her in your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne

as Cool Sexy <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Let's just, like, drop it, now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have two friends named <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I also know <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane Lane.

So, there's that.

</line>


<line>
Why are we talking about other <name type="PERSON">Di</name>anes?

</line>


<line>
Hey, wouldn't it be f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny

if you tried to text Cool Sexy <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

but then instead you texted

Regular <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ring <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane by mistake?

</line>


<line>
And then I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed up

and you were like, <name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>'s this chick?"

</line>


<line>
All night, I'd be hanging out with you,

thinking I was one of the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ng,

but it was just a big mistake

because you meant to text--

Oh, shit, that's exactly what happened.

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, please hear me out...

[voice deepens and distorts]

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughter, distorted]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[panting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, wait. Come on.

- I get it, okay?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the cool kids. I'm the nerd.

I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have known.

</line>


<line>
So I texted the wrong person. So what?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his isn't high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no nerds and no cool kids.

We're all adults.

</line>


<line>
We're hanging out together

and having a good time.

</line>


<line>
- So just come back inside.

- Everyone knows I don't belong there.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you belong

wherever you want to belong, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah?

- Yeah, look at me.

</line>


<line>
I'm a handsome white guy

and I never feel like I don't belong.

</line>


<line>
Also, you took a shit ton of gush.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hings are about to get insane.

- I just took one pill.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's a shit ton.

</line>


<line>
- My jeans feel amazing right now.

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is great.

</line>


<line>
I feel so much love.

I got to tell someone.

</line>


<line>
Yes, yes, tell me.

I'm in this with you, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
No. I got to go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

I got to tell my husband.

</line>


<line>
- [sighs]

- Wait, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat tree is amazing.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! [shudders]

</line>


<line>
- Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn?

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've got to be kidding me.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a cat.

- And you're a mouse.

</line>


<line>
- I think I know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w this ends.

- [both chuckling]

</line>


<line>
Let's not waste each other's time

and cut right to the chase.

</line>


<line>
- It was nice to meet you, uh...?

- <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name> <name type="PERSON">Stilton</name>. It was nice to meet you.

<line>
Oh! I am right there with you.

</line>


<line>

I could use a bite to eat, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's this great place

aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the corner.

<line>
Nobody's fault, right?

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> jet.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to talk some sense

into my daughter.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, talking sense into people

isn't really my thing.

</line>


<line>
In fact, I'm better at the opposite.

</line>


<line>
I once got <name type="PERSON">Nic Cage</name> to buy

<name type="PERSON">Char</name>lie Chaplin's mustache on <name type="ORG">eBay</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was his last ten bucks.

<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, I don't want to pretend

like we're g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>sts.

<line>
I want to go in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>tel room

- Yeah, but it seems like you're--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld just go to bed.

</line>


<line>
- I'm, uh, I'm feeling kind of sick.

- Oh, yeah. Okay.

</line>

But, hey, it was really great seeing you.

- Yeah, yeah, good night.

like crazy, smearing blood everywhere.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, this is me.

- [alarm chirps]

</line>


<line>
I think as far as disasters go,

that was one of the better ones.

</line>


<line>
It's the best non-date I've ever had.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I was thinking,

maybe some time we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have a--

</line>


<line>
- What's the opposite of a non-date?

- A date.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the word.

- I'd like that.

</line>


<line>
Well, great, great.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
When can I see you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

When's your next night off?

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I say something? Is it because

I asked for the glass of milk?

</line>


<line>
- If you give me a cookie--

- No, you're great.

</line>


<line>
It's just r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning an agency

doesn't give me a lot of nights off.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell you what, here's my card.

If you're ever free, give me a call.

</line>


<line>
If not, I'll just meet somebody else

and invite you to the wedding.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, thanks.

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to come, but send a gift.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha?

- [sniffling] <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
- I was thinking about what you said--

- Stop doing that.

</line>


<line>
Nobody s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be thinking

about the things I say.

</line>


<line>
- I love <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>. But does she complete me?

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>aneisha, nobody completes anybody.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not a real thing.

</line>


<line>
If you're lucky enough to find someone

you can halfway tolerate,

sink your nails in and don't let go,

no matter what.

</line>


<line>
- So, what, I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld just settle?

- Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.

</line>


<line>
Because otherwise you're just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

get older, and harder, and more alone.

</line>


<line>
And you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do everything you can

to fill that <name type="PERSON">ho</name>le, with friends,

and your career, and meaningless sex,

but the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>le doesn't get filled.

</line>


<line>
One day, you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> look aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

and you're going to realize

that everybody loves you,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he point is, I'm all of the <name type="PERSON">Di</name>anes.

</line>


<line>
I know exactly what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
I love that you do crazy things

that make no sense,

like fill our <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use up

with spaghetti strainers.

</line>


<line>
I had a very good reason for that,

but I do not remember what it was.

</line>


<line>
And we're really good for each other.

Or at least, you're good for me.

</line>


<line>
And you're f<name type="ORG">un</name>. And you're sweet.

</line>


<line>
And I love you. And I need you.

</line>


<line>
And I don't always know

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to tell you that. But drugs help.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ney. Drugs are great.

</line>


<line>
And now, I'm going to carry my man to bed.

and that means it's a good idea.

</line>

</line>


<line>

- [sighs] Pointless.

</line>


<line>
Yes, most dates are.

Well, I've prepared our agreement.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok it over, sign it at your leisure.

- I don't have any leisure.

</line>


<line>
While you're signing, I have a stack

of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>liday cards for the staff.

</line>
