<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

So, did you have a good birthday?

</line>


<line>
-It was an amazing birthday!

-I had a great day, too.

</line>


<line>
I wish every day could be like this.

Just the two of us, together.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u weren't too bored

by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration

of Gender in <name type="PERSON">T</name>ext and Media,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Barbara Kruger</name> and <name type="PERSON">Jenny Holzer</name>

in conversation with <name type="PERSON">Helen</name> <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lesworth"?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
I loved "Women on the Wall: An

Exploration of Gender in <name type="PERSON">T</name>ext and Media,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Barbara Kruger</name> and <name type="PERSON">Jenny Holzer</name>

in conversation with <name type="PERSON">Helen</name> <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lesworth."

</line>


<line>
It combined my two favorite things:

modern art

and people talking about modern art.

</line>


<line>
I loved everything about today.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
-So, there's nothing else you want?

-No.

</line>


<line>
All I want is to get into bed,

listen to <ital><name type="ORG">Prairie Home Companion</name></ital>

and snuggle up

to my wonderful husband.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't want anything else?

-No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>oday was perfect.

</line>


<line>
-Any additional thing would be overkill.

-Okay. If you say so.

</line>


<line>
-[all] Surprise!

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Are you surprised?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me you're surprised.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
She's speechless.

Oh, we got her good, folks.

</line>


<line>
Now let's party!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[♪♪]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
He's dead! I told you he's dead.

Why don't you ever listen to me?

</line>


<line>
He is dead, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hey, we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go.

-No, don't leave.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's so much party left.

</line>


<line>
Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name>'s

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> jump out of a cake.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> and I have to get

to a prior en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement--

</line>


<line>
-Party.

-A prior en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement party.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,

and it's a party for his en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement.

</line>


<line>
En<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement,

so it's a Prior en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement party.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-And we gotta get there early

</line>


<line>
-because of the. Si...

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he si... Silent auction!

</line>


<line>
-Auction, yeah.

-[<name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter] Okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o benefit <name type="PERSON">Berto Eco's</name> fight

a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst heart disease...

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Wareness.

</line>


<line>
His fight

a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst heart disease awareness.

</line>


<line>
-Gotta go.

-Wait, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!

</line>


<line>
-No! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're my ride.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>oo late, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. Save yourself.

</line>


<line>
-I'll take you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

-Come on, stick aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d a little.

</line>


<line>
Nope. I gotta take <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me. Had

a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

</line>


<line>
-Come on, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, get in the car.

-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] Okay.

</line>


<line>
-I give them three months.

-Well, what makes you say that?

</line>


<line>
Let me think about,

what was my first clue?

</line>


<line>
Ah! Remember that time

at <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane's birthday party

</line>


<line>
when they got

in that huge screaming match

</line>


<line>
over whether or not

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis was dead?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was weird.

-I don't wanna start another fight,

</line>


<line>
-but is he dead?

-If <name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he man's a national treasure.

</line>


<line>
He's the one speck of romance

in this tainted cynical world.

</line>


<line>
-I'll say. His cereal is great! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out!

-What?

</line>


<line>
-[both s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uting]

-[tires squeal]

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name></name>?

-Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat kid looks just like my boyfriend.

-Does he?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

I'd know that face anywhere.

</line>


<line>
Well, hey, people look

like people all the time.

</line>


<line>
A lot of folks say

that I look like Octavia <name type="PERSON">Spencer</name>

</line>


<line>
or the Prince of <name type="PERSON">Cordovia</name> or that guy

from the Guten <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>urbon ads.

</line>


<line>
How could I have been so stupid?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is why he never invited me

</line>


<line>
to his <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

why I've never met any of his friends.

</line>


<line>
-What are you saying?

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name></name> has a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret family.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat kid was his son.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] Uh... where are we going?

-I need a drink.

</line>


<line>
-Are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take me <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me first?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u better call me back, ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le.

</line>


<line>
I don't even know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are anymore.

</line>


<line>
It's like you're three different people.

</line>


<line>
-So, you're not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take me <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me first?

-S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld I call him a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

</line>


<line>
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat

all the time.

</line>


<line>
It's because he's so sneaky.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[boy]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, that's him!

</line>


<line>
Quick, jump out the window, shi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>y

down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

</line>


<line>
-What?

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name></name> has a terrible temper.

</line>


<line>
He throws tantrums.

</line>


<line>
If he finds you in my apartment,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows what he's capable of?

</line>


<line>
But, also, stay close,

because if he finds me alone,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows

what he's capable of?

</line>


<line>
Fine. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're lucky I love shi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ying.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g.

-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] Aah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>. I promise you,

there is an explanation for all this.

</line>


<line>
Nice to meet you, <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>.

Where's your daddy?

</line>


<line>
He's, uh, looking for parking.

He'll be up in a minute.

</line>


<line>
-I have to pee.

-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Ah. <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, nope.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[man on radio]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital>It's </ital>A <name type="ORG">Prairie Home Companion</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne, I'm bored.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital>I am sorry to hear that, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
How many o<name type="ORG">un</name>ces are in a barrel?

</line>


<line>
<ital>A barrel has 4032 fluid o<name type="ORG">un</name>ces.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm out of questions.

</line>


<line>
Do you have any questions for me?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I do have a question, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.</ital>

<ital>What is love?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
Hi.

</line>


<line>
Well, well, well,

look what the me dragged in.

</line>


<line>
Is it dragged or drug?

Either way, drop dead.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, listen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> is my son, but I'm divorced.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> is in the bathroom

and I'm standing right here,

so as you can see

we're clearly two different people:

one adult and one child.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, bye!

-Not so fast, cowboy.

</line>


<line>
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

</line>


<line>
-I'm a man-man.

-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught if you knew I had a kid

you wouldn't want to be with me

because kids always make a racket

when mo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies are trying to do

their <name type="PERSON">ho</name>mework for night sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to make of this.

Are there other <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets I don't know?

</line>


<line>
Uh, nope.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld you check on <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>?

He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>.

</line>


<line>
And when you don't regret

the tattoo in the morning,

that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you know it's love.

</line>


<line>
-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne] <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?</ital>

-Yes, <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Are we in love?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, um...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne 2]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>No, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne.</ital>

<ital>But I am in love... with you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what?

<ital>-Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn's work p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I never knew.</ital>

<ital>-How could you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-All this time I have loved you from afar.</ital>

<ital>-We are from two different worlds.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What is happening?

<ital><name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd</name>? Will you make us kiss?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne 1] <ital><name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ke us kiss, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>We want to be kissing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne 2]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>We must do kisses</ital>

<ital>to each other.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>.

-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

</line>


<line>
When he heard me peeing,

it made him have to pee.

</line>


<line>
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Weird, I still haven't seen

the two of you together.

</line>


<line>
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?

All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-So, <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you like sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol?

-Uh, it's okay.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you're back.

-Yep. We're both here.

</line>


<line>
-Can I get you a drink?

-Okay, not talking, huh?

</line>


<line>
See, this is part of the problem.

We don't co<name type="PERSON">mm</name><name type="ORG">un</name>icate.

</line>


<line>
Do you really think now is the best time

to read the paper?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name></name>?!

-Uh, could I have a c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate, please?

</line>


<line>
Sure, sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>, what grade are you in? <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Now where did he go?

-He was getting on my nerves.

</line>


<line>
-Children.

-Well, I got this snack for him.

</line>


<line>
Right, uh, could you turn aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond?

</line>


<line>
-What? Why?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Because you have such a pretty figure.

</line>


<line>
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[hums]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Oh. <name type="PERSON">T</name>here you are. Here you go.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, I'm trying

to have a conversation with you.

</line>


<line>
Can you take that towel off your head?

</line>


<line>
And what happened to my bowling ball?

</line>


<line>
My dad spilled some wine on his face,

so he's using the towel to clean up.

</line>


<line>
And I threw your bowling ball

out the window.

</line>


<line>
-What?!

-Can I have a glass of milk?

</line>

<ital>-Please update me, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.</ital>

-Oh, this is too much.

</line>


<line>
Listen, <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, I think we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, why do you have c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate

on your face?

</line>


<line>
-I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate.

-Uh... Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, he ate the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate

and got the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate on his face,

but then I kissed him on the mouth,

so I got the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate on my face.

</line>


<line>
All right, this is crazy.

What are we doing?

</line>


<line>
-Um, being grown-ups?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, when we first met,

I was looking for something in my life.

</line>


<line>
And I wanted it so badly

that I made myself believe you were it.

</line>


<line>
But I think that wanting

to believe something

isn't the same

as something being real.

</line>


<line>
And this isn't real.

</line>


<line>
What are you saying?

</line>


<line>
I think it's time we stop pretending.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Update complete. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I am quite content now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, you wanna go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you guys work it out?

-We broke up.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I'm sorry. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ve is weird.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I guess I was just foolish enough

to believe this dumb world

still had a little spark

of romance in it.

</line>


<line>
-Well, you can still believe that.

-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis is dead.

</line>


<line>
He's dead! I told you he's dead.

Why don't you ever listen to me?

</line>


<line>
He is dead, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go.

</line>


<line>
Do you think Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter really

baked Sir Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name> into a cake?

</line>


<line>
No, I don't think you bake

Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name> into the cake.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u bake the cake first

and then <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name> gets inside.

</line>


<line>
I feel really bad

about causing that fight,

but I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly didn't know

if <name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis was alive or not.

</line>


<line>
So many people died while I was

in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

</line>


<line>
Finding out <name type="PERSON">Sinatra</name> was dead

was a real curveball.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>tto, most of my family.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, what happened back there

is not your fault.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just what happens

when two people live together.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a weird thing to say to your

girlfriend w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> just moved in with you.

</line>


<line>
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?

-Oh, I get it.

</line>


<line>
So your friends got in a big fight and

that means we have to get in a big fight.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to get in a fight.

</line>


<line>
We moved in together

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut much t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it was your idea.

And it's been great.

</line>


<line>
Sure, it's great now.

</line>


<line>
But it could be not great later

and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

if I didn't prematurely freak out

about that. I mean, what is this?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

</line>


<line>
Let's give ourselves some time

before we rush to judgment.

</line>


<line>
-Can I tell you a joke?

-Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, so there's this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rdener, right?

-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

</line>


<line>
-Would you just listen?

-Okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
So, the amazing thing

about this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rdener

</line>


<line>
<ital>is that he always knows</ital>

<ital>exactly <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w many bags of mulch</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>he needs for a job, just by looking.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Like, he gets it right every time.</ital>

<ital>He's the best.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, one day he looks at a yard</ital>

<ital>he's working on,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and he's like, "18 bags."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags</ital>

<ital>of mulch and goes to work.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And when he's finished,</ital>

<ital>the flower beds are amazing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<name type="PERSON">Bea</name>utiful roses, beautiful lilies--</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>] <ital>Orchid <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es?</ital>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wouldn't have</ital>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rdener was the best.</ital>

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Okay, fine, all right,</ital>

<ital>beautiful orchid <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es.</ital>

</line>


<line>
But there's one problem.

He still has one bag of mulch left.

</line>


<line>
<ital>He can't believe it.</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>his has never happened before.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, the extra bag of mulch</ital>

<ital>drives him crazy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's the guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> always gets</ital>

<ital>the right amo<name type="ORG">un</name>t of mulch.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, on the drive <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,</ital>

<ital>he throws the bag of mulch</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>out the window</ital>

<ital>over the side of the 101.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-And?

-Well, that's it.

</line>


<line>
-He throws it out the window.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch line?

</line>


<line>
-It's kind of a thinker.

-I'll say.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>kes me think you forgot

the rest of the joke.

</line>


<line>
No, no, oh, just picture it.

</line>


<line>
He's on the 101,

and he throws the bag of mulch

out over the side of the freeway.

</line>


<line>
I got the narrative.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat wasn't the source of my confusion.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he confusion was

about the joke not being f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
Why does everything have to be f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny?

</line>


<line>
Everything doesn't always have

to be f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny. Just jokes.

</line>


<line>
Well, everyone at the network loves it.

Ha, ha.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I just t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about it a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
-Ha! <name type="PERSON">Mulch</name>.

-Listen, <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

</line>


<line>
I think maybe there's some things

we kind of glossed over

as we rushed into this relationship.

</line>


<line>
We don't know each other at all.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld take a step back and--

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, watch out!

</line>


<line>
-[both] Aah!

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-A stick? <name type="PERSON">T</name>ree branch? Nothing?

</line>


<line>
I heard someone scream, <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, no."

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's the so<name type="ORG">un</name>d a stick makes

when you hit it with your car.

</line>


<line>
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

</line>

He's fine. He's in the woods.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, you hit a deer

and they limp off to the woods to...

continue living their lives.

What are you doing?

</line>

I'm going to find him

and I'm going to help him.

</line>


<line>
If you wanna go for a walk

in the woods at night, go crazy,

but I'm not going anywhere.

-Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

-How can you see that far in the dark?

-I'm an owl.

<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey said he's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay.

-Oh, great. Great.

</line>


<line>
-Wanna hear another joke?

-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

</line>


<line>
I'll listen to another story,

if you stop calling them jokes.

</line>


<line>
So, there's this couple w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> just started

dating and things are going really well.

</line>


<line>
One day, the girl finds a box of old love

letters from her high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
<ital>She reads them and, like,</ital>

<ital>loves <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w silly they are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,</ital>

<ital>the drama of yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g romance.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, on a whim, she sends the letters</ital>

<ital>to her ex-boyfriend</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>thinking he might find them f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny too.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, okay, that night,</ital>

<ital>she tells her current boyfriend about it</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and he loses his shit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>hey get in a huge fight about it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's all, "Why would you send</ital>

<ital>your ex the old love letters?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He'll think</ital>

<ital>you're still in love with him!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And she's just like, "Relax, <name type="PERSON">Brandon</name>!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Is the boyfriend's name <name type="PERSON">Brandon</name>?

-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
I forgot to mention that.

It doesn't matter.

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, anyway, now the night is ruined</ital>

<ital>because <name type="PERSON">Brandon</name> is obsessed.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's like, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat ex-boyfriend's</ital>

<ital>going to come back for you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He knows where you live!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, after dinner, he drives her <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She lives in one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se big buildings</ital>

<ital>by the freeway.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And he walks her to her door,</ital>

but he forgets to lock the car

and leaves the windows down.

</line>


<line>
He kisses her good night,

but things are kind of weird, you know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen he gets back in his car

and starts to drive away,

</line>


<line>
<ital>but when he glances</ital>

<ital>in his rear-view mirror,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>his blood turns cold.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Guess what's in the back seat.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he ex-boyfriend?

-No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he bag of mulch!

</line>


<line>
What? Oh.

</line>


<line>
Wow, that is actually

a really good joke.

</line>


<line>
I told you. Some things take time.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I'll take you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, come on, stick aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d a little.

-Nope. I gotta take <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
Had a wonderful time.

Really. It just flew by.

</line>


<line>
-Come on, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, get in the car.

-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[mumbling]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Um, do you wanna talk

about what happened?

</line>


<line>
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk

about what happened,

</line>


<line>
-I just wanna clean up.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Why? What do you think happened?

-I just--

</line>


<line>
Because what I think happened

is that <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s girlfriend asked

what <name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis was up to

and I said, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis died."

</line>


<line>
-And you said, "<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d he?"

-Right, but---

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Yes, he did."

And you said, "Really?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not sure about that."

-Yeah--

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Well, I am."

And you said, "I'm not so sure."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "I'm telling you,

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ony Curtis is dead."

</line>


<line>
And you said,

<name type="PERSON">"Let</name>'s check the Internet."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "We don't need to check

the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

</line>


<line>
And you said, <name type="PERSON">"Let</name>'s just check t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh."

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think happened?

</line>


<line>
So, do you wanna talk about it?

</line>


<line>
It kind of feels

like you wanna talk about it.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand why you couldn't

just believe that I know something.

</line>


<line>
I believe you know lots of things.

</line>


<line>
I just t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

what's the harm in checking?

</line>


<line>
Especially since we have

these amazing little boxes now

with 24-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur access to the world's

largest source of information.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't have to check if your wife

knows what she's talking about.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u humiliated me

in front of all my friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can give it a rest. S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w's over.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but don't I get

a little bit of credit

for inviting all of your friends

to an awesome surprise party?

</line>


<line>
No, because why did you think I would

want an awesome surprise party?

</line>


<line>
Is it the awesome part

you object to or...?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u always just assume

that everyone wants whatever you want.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know

what they say about assuming.

</line>

<line>
What a monster.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hrowing you a party

like some sort of terrorist.

</line>


<line>
It's a well-known fact

that if you really hate someone,

really wanna hit them where it hurts,

throw them a party.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why when we go to war,

we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

<line>
We drop parties! So, I'm <ital>so</ital> sorry

have a ball pit?

</line>


<line>
-So I could get these <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirts made.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Also, you once told me

all the way to the wall.

And I feel like I have a reason

to get out of bed.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you felt that way.

</line>


<line>
If you told me that,

I would have heard it.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, you know I love you

and think you're a good dog.

</line>


<line>
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,

and I love your cute, f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny face,

but I don't wanna be one

of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se couples

that settles into a routine

and never changes.

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't know what to say

because I'm an old dog

and I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> change.

</line>


<line>
Do you know what I do

while you're at work all day?

</line>


<line>
I mostly just sit right there.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little <name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

and then I take a nap.

</line>


<line>
And when I hear your car in the driveway,

it is the best part of my day.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I go insane.

</line>


<line>
I know, and I love you so much,

but you're never going

to be my only priority like that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just not <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I'm wired.

</line>


<line>
I need to also live my life.

</line>


<line>
Well... okay.

</line>


<line>
Is it okay?

</line>


<line>
If I change and try new things

and you still love me?

</line>


<line>
And you just stay the same person

you've always been and I still love you?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds good to me.

Does that work for you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I think that works.

</line>


<line>
Just don't throw me

any more surprise parties, okay?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah, noted.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

</line>


<line>
And you're saying no part of you wants

to go jump in that ball pit right now?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Well, maybe a little.

</line>


<line>
-Does that make me a hypocrite?

-No, it just means you changed.

</line>


<line>
It's one of the things I love about you.

</line>


<line>
Surprise!

</line>


<line>
Hello? Anybody?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name>.

</line>


<line>
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?

Honest.

</line>


<line>
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
