  <title>Yesterdayland - <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
So, at the end of the day,

</line>


<line>
I'm just a regular guy trying

to live a regular life.

</line>


<line>
Remember that time you peed

in Drew <name type="PERSON">Barry</name>more's car?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yes, I remember that.

Why do you remember that?

</line>


<line>
It was in your book.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld do that to someone here.

-What? No.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, I can't believe

I'm on a date with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
I feel like that anonymous girl

from Chapter 8 of your book

mixed with the pluck and determination

of that anonymous girl

</line>


<line>
-from Chapter 12.

-We don't need to dwell on the past.

</line>


<line>
Wait, shut up.

Is this the restaurant you bought

when you were trying

to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter?

</line>


<line>
-Uh... No.

-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

</line>


<line>
Want to yell at the waiter

and make a scene?

</line>


<line>
-No, I don't need--

-Come on, do that <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> thing

where you make a big deal

and everyone laughs,

but at the same time we relate,

because you're saying

the things polite society won't.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not-- Ugh...

</line>


<line>
-Is everything all right over here?

-No, everything is not all right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his table's been wobbling all evening.

</line>


<line>
If I wanted to flop aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d and get seasick

for an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur, I'd call your mother.

</line>


<line>
-Something in that area or...?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake me <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me now

and don't let me get out of bed

<name type="ORG">un</name>til I turn <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse-colored.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing?

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you want me to stay?

</line>


<line>
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

</line>


<line>
Some of us here are trying

to forget you exist.

</line>


<line>
"Forget you exist."

Classic <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ve it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Claire]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, are you <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] Uh, yes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Claire]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> "Shut up, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd!"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Claire laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Aw, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[♪♪]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, can you drive me

to get my car?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be responsible last night,

so I Ubered <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

</line>


<line>
-and left my car in the fo<name type="ORG">un</name>tain.

-Sorry, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.

It's finally happening. My <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
I realize that by saying "what"

I might set off a chain of events

</line>


<line>
whereby we continue this conversation,

but what?

</line>


<line>
Well, remember when I first moved in

and I kept asking

</line>


<line>
-if we could go to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland?

-I do not.

</line>


<line>
And then you said

that there was no <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland was a made-up lie,

</line>


<line>
like the tooth fairy, that parents use

to get their kids to behave.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

-Sure did.

</line>


<line>
But then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

why isn't there a <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland?

</line>


<line>
People would love it!

</line>


<line>
So, I took matters into my own hands,

</line>


<line>
and over the last five years,

I built my own <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been doing this for five years?

How have you never mentioned it?

</line>


<line>
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable

dirt by the toxic waste dump

</line>


<line>
-up the hill from the old fire station.

-Okay, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> build a <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

-So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great, champ.

</line>


<line>
If it wasn't for that,

she never would've gotten sober.

</line>


<line>
Just finished drawing up blueprints

for that <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland I'm building.

</line>


<line>
Kind of busy here, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
So, it turned out to be a good thing

I peed in her car.

</line>


<line>
Sorry for all the noise.

</line>


<line>
Got this crew of worker bees

to help me build my <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I get it. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are building

your own <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

-Anyway, tomorrow we open the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>tes.

</line>


<line>
Finally, people will have a place to go

after they win the <name type="PERSON">Sup</name>er <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>wl.

</line>


<line>
But you do know

that there already is a <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, I built it.

-No, I mean the real <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean, the one in the hearts

and minds of children everywhere?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one in <name type="PERSON">Ana</name>heim!

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</line>


<line>
Are we?

</line>


<line>
Well, I think it's safe

to take the cone off.

</line>


<line>
I can do it for a small co-pay.

</line>


<line>
Can't say I'll miss it,

but we did have some crazy adventures

together these last few weeks.

</line>


<line>
Honey, would you rub my chin for me

so I can remember things?

</line>


<line>
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

</line>


<line>
Yeah, memories.

</line>


<line>
Hey, where s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we go for my first meal

after the operation?

</line>


<line>
It's not an operation,

but we could go to <name type="ORG">Storky</name>'s a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah! We're finally due

for our free sub.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"<name type="ORG">Storky</name></name>'s,

where your 81st sandwich is free."

</line>


<line>
We've been there 80 times?

It just opened last month.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever

you suggest it, I always say yes.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but 80 times?

</line>


<line>
Well, that'll be $6000.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d thing you're getting

a free sandwich, huh?

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
Okay, you guys. [yells]

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u vultures are killing me!

</line>


<line>
I'm sure he's talking about

other vultures.

</line>


<line>
Ah, the <name type="LOC">Valley</name>.

</line>


<line>
Because sometimes you wanna go

where no one knows your name.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>] <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man!

-<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>? Hey, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w are you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Oh, great!

</line>


<line>
-How's the book biz?

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> knows?

</line>


<line>
I jumped off that burning ship.

Print media? What a joke.

</line>


<line>
Now I got a job

in broadcast network television,

a booming industry

with nowhere to go but up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Oh, my boss loves this place.

</line>


<line>
Do you know <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> Pierce?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> just got named head

of progra<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing at <name type="ORG">MBN</name>.

</line>


<line>
We're here to celebrate.

</line>


<line>
Well, that and she just woke up

from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
Wait, she just got out

of a 30-year coma

and she's the head of progra<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing

at a major broadcast network?

</line>


<line>
She's been with the company 30 years.

Everyone above her kept getting fired.

</line>


<line>
Besides, she's got

some really fresh ideas.

</line>


<line>
I am really feeling

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Kirk <name type="PERSON">Cameron</name> S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't even need a pilot.

Let's just order 22 episodes.

</line>


<line>
How about a new s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

where celebrities try to guess

whether or not people have talent?

</line>


<line>
We'll air it three nights a week.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sp]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar

<name type="PERSON">David</name> Copperfield

to make

the World <name type="PERSON">T</name>rade Center disappear?

</line>


<line>
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

but <name type="PERSON">David</name> Copperfield really isn't

a big draw anymore.

</line>


<line>
Actually, everything feels fresh

if you just forget

the last 30 years ever happened.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[woman over <name type="GPE">PA</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital>And here's a special request.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I've never even heard of this song,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but let's give it a spin:</ital>

<ital>"Special Feeling."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, meet

the one and only <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>?

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>?

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
Is that name supposed

to mean something to me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[light rock ballad playing over speakers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Do you want to go skate?

-Nah. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what they say,

you can lead a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse to roller,

but you can't make him rink.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's really f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be on <name type="PERSON">T</name>V,

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

which, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ly shit, they're flat now.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I was on. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what,

I'm sick of talking about me.

</line>


<line>
Let's talk about you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Next thing I know,

I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,

but it's not ideal.

</line>


<line>
She's molting.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w sisters are.

</line>


<line>
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here

with the regulars.

</line>


<line>
How hard is it to look

before they bring it out?

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me, miss?

-I know, isn't it cool?

</line>


<line>
-Like we're getting away with something.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Don't you love it when appetizers have

a little crossover episode?

</line>


<line>
It's like when you're watching

<ital>Happy Days </ital>and <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>rk s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ws up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Or like when <name type="PERSON">Kramer</name> was

on <ital><name type="PERSON">Murphy</name> <name type="PERSON">Brown</name></ital>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>?

-Hey, you want to get out of here?

</line>


<line>
I don't want <name type="ORG">MBN</name> to just be another boring

old network, you know what I mean?

</line>


<line>
-Yes, totally.

-I want to take risks.

</line>


<line>
I want to swing for the fences, you know?

Otherwise, what are we doing?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is it morning?

We stayed up all night talking,

</line>


<line>
-and we didn't even have sex.

-Well, it's not too late.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was fantastic.

-Oh, yes.

</line>


<line>
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.

I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe.

</line>


<line>
-Something's wrong.

-What is it?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want

to spend more time with you

</line>


<line>
-even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh I know we just had sex.

-Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
No, you don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
We already had sex,

but I still want to spend time with you.

</line>


<line>
Is that normal? Am I normal?

What is happening to me?

</line>


<line>
We can spend more time together.

</line>


<line>
I want to do things with you.

Fully clothed, sober, in daylight <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand these feelings.

</line>


<line>
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, it's coming. I can't stop it.

</line>


<line>
-Do you want to go to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[carnival music playing over speakers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[child crying]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland has a lot more sparking wires

and loose nails than I remember.

</line>


<line>
Please <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld your questions

<name type="ORG">un</name>til the end of the tour.

</line>


<line>
Here we have

Mr. <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's Wild <name type="PERSON">Death</name>-Coaster.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he name is a work in progress,

but we wanted to work "death"

into the title for liability reasons.

</line>


<line>
And this is <name type="PERSON">Gabe</name> Jr.,

the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is boring. I want to go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name></name>, be nice!

</line>


<line>
He's a little cranky

because he just got adult braces.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean, braces.

-Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, stop embarrassing me!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
And here we have <name type="PERSON">Cinderella</name>'s

magical pile of used mattresses.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[child]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Help!

</line>


<line>
Is it a good idea

to keep all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se mattresses

</line>


<line>
-so close to an active grease fire?

-Where's your sense of wonder, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur friend is really ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive.

-Yeah, don't be so ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know I hate ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tivity.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I don't hate it because

that's also ne<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive, but you know.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[quacks, then yells]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[children laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

-Hey, buddy. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his place is amazing.

</line>


<line>
It's like some sort of <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sney version

of Knott's <name type="FAC">Berry Farm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's exactly

what I was going for!

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to get involved

and really spray the old

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter scent on everything.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this

as kind of just my thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, technically, you did build this

while working for P.B. Livin,

so I have the blah-blah-blah

of first refusal or whatever.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's just good business.

</line>


<line>
We're in this together now, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd,

and nothing will distract me from--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Eric</name>a! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't be here.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his place is filled with children.

</line>


<line>
Coach said he saw you headed

to the visitor's locker room

with a steel pipe.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u really think I'm the guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> busted that pinto's leg?

</line>


<line>
'Cause if I am, you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be

a lot more goddamn scared of me.

</line>


<line>
Hey! My girlfriend's here.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

</line>


<line>
Sure. We'll cut there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he middle of your line

is as good a place as any.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Just wanted to stop by.

</line>


<line>
We're filming <ital>Hey, I <name type="PERSON">T</name>hink</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u Can Dance! </ital>next door.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at you, all professional.

</line>


<line>
Like <name type="PERSON">Natalie</name> Portman in that movie

where she was a professional.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>? [giggles]

People are watching.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he first time <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> dates a woman

his own age,

she's basically just

a st<name type="ORG">un</name>ted 20-year-old.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s st<name type="ORG">un</name>ted, too.

He got famous in his twenties,

so he'll be

in his twenties forever.

</line>


<line>
After you get famous, you stop growing,

you don't have to.

</line>


<line>
Every celebrity has

an age of stagnation.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I never got famous.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,

but I'm not famous-famous.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't just happen

when you get famous.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur age of stagnation

is when you stop growing.

</line>


<line>
For most, it's when they get married,

settle into a routine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u meet someone

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> loves you <name type="ORG">un</name>conditionally

and never challenges you

or wants you to change,

and then you never change.

</line>


<line>
But mostly it's just the famous people,

right?

</line>


<line>
Stella! Stella!

</line>


<line>
Corona Light.

Hey, what's going on here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been served

with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

the Walt <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sney Company.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make sure what we were

doing here was 100 percent le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l,

</line>


<line>
-so I called a lawyer.

-Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
As it turns out, it's not le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l at all.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knew?

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

-We'll see you in court.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he food court?

-No. Regular court.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But also I'm h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry, so I might

just stop by <name type="ORG">the food court</name> first.

</line>


<line>
Let the record s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w, this is the single

dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> throw this out there.

</line>


<line>
Is it possible maybe when the other guys

tried to copyright the name <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland,

they wrote down something else

by mistake,

so "<name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland" is still up for grabs?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, let's have a look

at <name type="ORG">the Articles of Incorporation</name> to see

if Walt <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sney accidentally tra<name type="NORP">dem</name>arked

the wrong name. I'm sure these--

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the defendant.

-Aw, sweet!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur Otter, this is a gross miscarriage

of justice.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>! Gross miscarriage!

</line>


<line>
And that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I turned my dream into

what I call "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Happiest Place On Urf."

</line>


<line>
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom

I added to the <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sney canon.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">America</name>ns, they like this theme park?

-Oh, they love it.

</line>


<line>
It represents everything

<name type="GPE">America</name> stands for.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Da.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I mean, yeah.

-We did it, buddy!

</line>


<line>
Actually, I did it.

</line>


<line>
I had the idea to build a park,

I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

</line>


<line>
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?

-But there is an "i" in "<name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland."

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">un</name>like that other <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland,

this <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sneyland only has one "i".

</line>


<line>
What are you saying?

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not welcome

at my theme park anymore.

if they see you to sting you on sight.

I don't care about that,

the real reason.

before I went into my coma.

</line>


<line>
I felt totally alone in this world

before I met <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

</line>


<line>
And then I met all of you, my friends.

</line>


<line>
But if you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> kick me to the curb

just because I think

you're all capitalist swine

and want to see your way

of life destroyed, well, so be it.

to make money and win lawsuits.

by greed that it destroyed them.

I don't need to take down capitalism.
