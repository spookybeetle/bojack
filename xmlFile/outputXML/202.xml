<line>
So, at the end of the day,

</line>


<line>
I'm just a regular guy trying

to live a regular life.

</line>


<line>
Remember that time you peed

in Drew Barrymore's car?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yes, I remember that.

Why do you remember that?

</line>


<line>
It was in your book.

</line>


<line>
-You should do that to someone here.

-What? No.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, I can't believe

I'm on a date with <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
I feel like that anonymous girl

from Chapter 8 of your book

mixed with the pluck and determination

of that anonymous girl

</line>


<line>
-from Chapter 12.

-We don't need to dwell on the past.

</line>


<line>
Wait, shut up.

Is this the restaurant you bought

when you were trying

to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
-Uh... No.

-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

</line>


<line>
Want to yell at the waiter

and make a scene?

</line>


<line>
-No, I don't need--

-Come on, do that <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> thing

where you make a big deal

and everyone laughs,

but at the same time we relate,

because you're saying

the things polite society won't.

</line>


<line>
That's not-- Ugh...

</line>


<line>
-Is everything all right over here?

-No, everything is not all right.

</line>


<line>
This table's been wobbling all evening.

</line>


<line>
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick

for an hour, I'd call your mother.

</line>


<line>
-Something in that area or...?

-Take me home now

and don't let me get out of bed

until I turn horse-colored.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing?

-Did you want me to stay?

</line>


<line>
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

</line>


<line>
Some of us here are trying

to forget you exist.

</line>


<line>
"Forget you exist."

Classic <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. Love it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Claire]</nonVerbComm> Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, are you <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>] Uh, yes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Claire]</nonVerbComm> "Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>!"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Claire laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm> Aw, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, can you drive me

to get my car?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be responsible last night,

so I Ubered home

</line>


<line>
-and left my car in the fountain.

-Sorry, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.

It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
I realize that by saying "what"

I might set off a chain of events

</line>


<line>
whereby we continue this conversation,

but what?

</line>


<line>
Well, remember when I first moved in

and I kept asking

</line>


<line>
-if we could go to Disneyland?

-I do not.

</line>


<line>
And then you said

that there was no Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

</line>


<line>
like the tooth fairy, that parents use

to get their kids to behave.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

-Sure did.

</line>


<line>
But then I thought,

why isn't there a Disneyland?

</line>


<line>
People would love it!

</line>


<line>
So, I took matters into my own hands,

</line>


<line>
and over the last five years,

I built my own Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
You've been doing this for five years?

How have you never mentioned it?

</line>


<line>
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable

dirt by the toxic waste dump

</line>


<line>
-up the hill from the old fire station.

-Okay, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.

-Sounds great, champ.

</line>


<line>
If it wasn't for that,

she never would've gotten sober.

</line>


<line>
Just finished drawing up blueprints

for that Disneyland I'm building.

</line>


<line>
Kind of busy here, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
So, it turned out to be a good thing

I peed in her car.

</line>


<line>
Sorry for all the noise.

</line>


<line>
Got this crew of worker bees

to help me build my Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I get it. You are building

your own Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

</line>


<line>
Finally, people will have a place to go

after they win the Super Bowl.

</line>


<line>
But you do know

that there already is a Disneyland?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, I built it.

-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
You mean, the one in the hearts

and minds of children everywhere?

</line>


<line>
-The one in Anaheim!

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</line>


<line>
Are we?

</line>


<line>
Well, I think it's safe

to take the cone off.

</line>


<line>
I can do it for a small co-pay.

</line>


<line>
Can't say I'll miss it,

but we did have some crazy adventures

together these last few weeks.

</line>


<line>
Honey, would you rub my chin for me

so I can remember things?

</line>


<line>
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

</line>


<line>
Yeah, memories.

</line>


<line>
Hey, where should we go for my first meal

after the operation?

</line>


<line>
It's not an operation,

but we could go to <name type="ORG">Storky</name>'s again.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah! We're finally due

for our free sub.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="ORG">Storky</name>'s,

where your 81st sandwich is free."

</line>


<line>
We've been there 80 times?

It just opened last month.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever

you suggest it, I always say yes.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but 80 times?

</line>


<line>
Well, that'll be $6000.

</line>


<line>
Good thing you're getting

a free sandwich, huh?

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
Okay, you guys. [yells]

You vultures are killing me!

</line>


<line>
I'm sure he's talking about

other vultures.

</line>


<line>
Ah, the <name type="LOC">Valley</name>.

</line>


<line>
Because sometimes you wanna go

where no one knows your name.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>] <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>!

-<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>? Hey, how are you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, great!

</line>


<line>
-How's the book biz?

-Who knows?

</line>


<line>
I jumped off that burning ship.

Print media? What a joke.

</line>


<line>
Now I got a job

in broadcast network television,

a booming industry

with nowhere to go but up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Oh, my boss loves this place.

</line>


<line>
Do you know <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> Pierce?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> just got named head

of programming at MBN.

</line>


<line>
We're here to celebrate.

</line>


<line>
Well, that and she just woke up

from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
Wait, she just got out

of a 30-year coma

and she's the head of programming

at a major broadcast network?

</line>


<line>
She's been with the company 30 years.

Everyone above her kept getting fired.

</line>


<line>
Besides, she's got

some really fresh ideas.

</line>


<line>
I am really feeling

<ital>The Kirk <name type="PERSON">Cameron</name> Show.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't even need a pilot.

Let's just order 22 episodes.

</line>


<line>
How about a new show

where celebrities try to guess

whether or not people have talent?

</line>


<line>
We'll air it three nights a week.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar

<name type="PERSON">David</name> Copperfield

to make

the World Trade Center disappear?

</line>


<line>
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

but <name type="PERSON">David</name> Copperfield really isn't

a big draw anymore.

</line>


<line>
Actually, everything feels fresh

if you just forget

the last 30 years ever happened.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman over PA]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>And here's a special request.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I've never even heard of this song,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but let's give it a spin:</ital>

<ital>"Special Feeling."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, meet

the one and only <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Who?

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Who?

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
Is that name supposed

to mean something to me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[light rock ballad playing over speakers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Do you want to go skate?

-Nah. You know what they say,

you can lead a horse to roller,

but you can't make him rink.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-That's really funny.

</line>


<line>
-You're funny.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. You should be on TV,

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

which, holy shit, they're flat now.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I was on. You know what,

I'm sick of talking about me.

</line>


<line>
Let's talk about you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>]</nonVerbComm> Next thing I know,

I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,

but it's not ideal.

</line>


<line>
She's molting.

You know how sisters are.

</line>


<line>
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here

with the regulars.

</line>


<line>
How hard is it to look

before they bring it out?

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me, miss?

-I know, isn't it cool?

</line>


<line>
-Like we're getting away with something.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Don't you love it when appetizers have

a little crossover episode?

</line>


<line>
It's like when you're watching

<ital>Happy Days </ital>and <name type="PERSON">Mork</name> shows up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Or like when <name type="PERSON">Kramer</name> was

on <ital>Murphy <name type="PERSON">Brown</name></ital>.

</line>


<line>
-Who?

-Hey, you want to get out of here?

</line>


<line>
I don't want MBN to just be another boring

old network, you know what I mean?

</line>


<line>
-Yes, totally.

-I want to take risks.

</line>


<line>
I want to swing for the fences, you know?

Otherwise, what are we doing?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is it morning?

We stayed up all night talking,

</line>


<line>
-and we didn't even have sex.

-Well, it's not too late.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
-That was fantastic.

-Oh, yes.

</line>


<line>
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.

I hope.

</line>


<line>
-Something's wrong.

-What is it?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want

to spend more time with you

</line>


<line>
-even though I know we just had sex.

-Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
No, you don't understand.

</line>


<line>
We already had sex,

but I still want to spend time with you.

</line>


<line>
Is that normal? Am I normal?

What is happening to me?

</line>


<line>
We can spend more time together.

</line>


<line>
I want to do things with you.

Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-I don't understand these feelings.

</line>


<line>
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, it's coming. I can't stop it.

</line>


<line>
-Do you want to go to Disneyland?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[carnival music playing over speakers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[child crying]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires

and loose nails than I remember.

</line>


<line>
Please hold your questions

until the end of the tour.

</line>


<line>
Here we have

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>'s Wild Death-Coaster.

</line>


<line>
The name is a work in progress,

but we wanted to work "death"

into the title for liability reasons.

</line>


<line>
And this is <name type="PERSON">Gabe</name> Jr.,

the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

</line>


<line>
-This is boring. I want to go home.

-<name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>, be nice!

</line>


<line>
He's a little cranky

because he just got adult braces.

</line>


<line>
-You mean, braces.

-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
And here we have <name type="PERSON">Cinderella</name>'s

magical pile of used mattresses.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[child]</nonVerbComm> Help!

</line>


<line>
Is it a good idea

to keep all those mattresses

</line>


<line>
-so close to an active grease fire?

-Where's your sense of wonder, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Your friend is really negative.

-Yeah, don't be so negative, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-You know I hate negativity.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I don't hate it because

that's also negative, but you know.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[quacks, then yells]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[children laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

</line>


<line>
It's like some sort of <name type="ORG">Disney</name> version

of <name type="ORG">Knott</name>'s Berry Farm.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's exactly

what I was going for!

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to get involved

and really spray the old

Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this

as kind of just my thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, technically, you did build this

while working for P.B. Livin,

so I have the blah-blah-blah

of first refusal or whatever.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's just good business.

</line>


<line>
We're in this together now, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>,

and nothing will distract me from--

</line>


<line>
Erica! You can't be here.

This place is filled with children.

</line>


<line>
Coach said he saw you headed

to the visitor's locker room

with a steel pipe.

</line>


<line>
You really think I'm the guy

who busted that pinto's leg?

</line>


<line>
'Cause if I am, you should be

a lot more goddamn scared of me.

</line>


<line>
Hey! My girlfriend's here.

Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

</line>


<line>
Sure. We'll cut there.

</line>


<line>
The middle of your line

is as good a place as any.

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Just wanted to stop by.

</line>


<line>
We're filming <ital>Hey, I Think</ital>

<ital>You Can Dance! </ital>next door.

</line>


<line>
Look at you, all professional.

</line>


<line>
Like <name type="PERSON">Natalie</name> Portman in that movie

where she was a professional.

</line>


<line>
Who? [giggles]

People are watching.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
The first time <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> dates a woman

his own age,

she's basically just

a stunted 20-year-old.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s stunted, too.

He got famous in his twenties,

so he'll be

in his twenties forever.

</line>


<line>
After you get famous, you stop growing,

you don't have to.

</line>


<line>
Every celebrity has

an age of stagnation.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I never got famous.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,

but I'm not famous-famous.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't just happen

when you get famous.

</line>


<line>
Your age of stagnation

is when you stop growing.

</line>


<line>
For most, it's when they get married,

settle into a routine.

</line>


<line>
You meet someone

who loves you unconditionally

and never challenges you

or wants you to change,

and then you never change.

</line>


<line>
But mostly it's just the famous people,

right?

</line>


<line>
Stella! Stella!

</line>


<line>
Corona Light.

</line>


<line>
This place is incredible.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make you feel at home,

and nothing was bigger in the '80s

than '50s nostalgia.

</line>


<line>
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,

feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

</line>


<line>
It's like if <ital>Back to the Future</ital>

and <ital>Peggy Sue Got Married </ital>got married.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man over radio]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Okay, teenyboppers,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>let's take things back</ital>

<ital>to the '50s, '50s style,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>with this classic '50s hit</ital>

<ital>that everybody remembers:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"I Just Met My Perfect Match."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, these last few days

have been so amazing.

</line>


<line>
You've given me a fresh start.

</line>


<line>
In fact, it almost feels like

I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up

from a 30-year coma?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no, not me. Her.

-That's insane.

</line>


<line>
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[record stops]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Whoa!</ital>

<ital>Sorry about that needle skip, folks.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Let's start that song again</ital>

<ital>from the beginning.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Alex</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

-And I'm <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's been really tough for me

these last few weeks.

</line>


<line>
I've never seen <ital>Home Alone </ital>and everyone

makes me feel like a freak because of it.

</line>


<line>
-You've never seen <ital>Home Alone?</ital>

-I've never seen it!

</line>


<line>
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.

-Neither do I!

</line>


<line>
-No one does. It's just a magic box.

-<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, we have so much in common.

</line>


<line>
Really it's just one thing.

</line>


<line>
You can't count each individual thing

as a different thing.

</line>


<line>
That's like saying I have a lot

in common with <name type="PERSON">Kanye West</name>

because we both breathe air.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm>

Who? <name type="PERSON">Jinx</name>. Buy me a <name type="ORG">Coke</name> Zero.

</line>


<line>
What's a <name type="ORG">Coke</name> Zero?

I have no idea.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know

there was anyone else like me.

</line>


<line>
Give me your fax and pager number

so I can add them to my <name type="ORG">Rolodex</name>.

</line>


<line>
Tubular.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't trust that guy.

I bet he's seen <ital>Home Alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'm starting to lose

the thread of your character.

</line>


<line>
You think you can drop the jealous

boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

</line>


<line>
You're right, I'm sorry.

Call me Snoop Dogg

</line>


<line>
-because I will drop it like it's hot.

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I don't--

</line>


<line>
I got that one! <name type="PERSON">Snoopy</name> the dog.

From "Peanuts." Okay.

</line>


<line>
I got here as fast as I could.

</line>


<line>
Where's this next <name type="PERSON">Haley Joel</name> Osment?

</line>


<line>
-That was a lie to get you here.

-Aw, fish.

</line>


<line>
-There's never a next <name type="PERSON">Haley Joel</name> Osment.

-And there never will be.

</line>


<line>
Sorry I tricked you, but with <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>

running his own Disneyland

and actress <name type="PERSON">Margo</name> <name type="PERSON">Martindale</name>

in prison

for some reason I don't remember,

you're the best friend I've got.

</line>


<line>
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt

on <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>'s new gentleman friend.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. What's the play here?

</line>


<line>
You'll find one little imperfection

and harp on it

like you do with my boyfriend?

</line>


<line>
You do understand what my "thing" is

with your boyfriend?

</line>


<line>
You'll just push her

into this other guy's arms.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name> likes you. Why ruin that?

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is Comrade Alexander</ital>

<ital>calling KGB High Command.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

and I still have not been contacted

by my handlers.

</line>


<line>
I am awaiting orders to take down

the American dogs and pigs

and other various animals and humans.

Come in, KGB High Command.

</line>


<line>
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's going on here?

</line>


<line>
You've been served

with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

the Walt <name type="ORG">Disney</name> Company.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make sure what we were

doing here was 100 percent legal,

</line>


<line>
-so I called a lawyer.

-Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.

Who knew?

</line>


<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter.

-We'll see you in court.

</line>


<line>
-The food court?

-No. Regular court.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might

just stop by the food court first.

</line>


<line>
Let the record show, this is the single

dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

</line>


<line>
Is it possible maybe when the other guys

tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

they wrote down something else

by mistake,

so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, let's have a look

at the Articles of Incorporation to see

if Walt <name type="ORG">Disney</name> accidentally trademarked

the wrong name. I'm sure these--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

</line>


<line>
With two "i"s. That son of a gun

trademarked the wrong name.

</line>


<line>
May I, counselor?

</line>


<line>
D-I-I-S.

This is unambiguous.

</line>


<line>
-I find in favor of the defendant.

-Aw, shit.

</line>


<line>
-You're the defendant.

-Aw, sweet!

</line>


<line>
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage

of justice.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>! Gross miscarriage!

</line>


<line>
And that's how I turned my dream into

what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

</line>


<line>
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom

I added to the <name type="ORG">Disney</name> canon.

</line>


<line>
-Americans, they like this theme park?

-Oh, they love it.

</line>


<line>
It represents everything

<name type="GPE">America</name> stands for.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Da.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I mean, yeah.

-We did it, buddy!

</line>


<line>
Actually, I did it.

</line>


<line>
I had the idea to build a park,

I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

</line>


<line>
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?

-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

</line>


<line>
And unlike that other Disneyland,

this Disneyland only has one "i".

</line>


<line>
What are you saying?

</line>


<line>
You're not welcome

at my theme park anymore.

</line>


<line>
There's only room for one goofy dog there

and his name is <name type="LOC">Pluto</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, no.

</line>


<line>
I've told the bees

if they see you to sting you on sight.

</line>


<line>
You understand. It's nothing personal.

It's just good business.

</line>


<line>
And that's how we do business on Urf.

</line>


<line>
-I don't like you like this.

-I learned it from you.

</line>


<line>
If I could get everyone's attention.

</line>


<line>
You're probably wondering

why I invited you all here tonight.

</line>


<line>
You said it was to celebrate

<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>'s legal victory.

</line>


<line>
Right, but obviously,

I don't care about that,

so you're probably wondering

the real reason.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm>

No, we just took you at face value.

</line>


<line>
We have a special guest here tonight.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alex</name>. Or should I say "comrade"?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Why would you say "comrade"?

-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alex</name> is a KGB agent

bent on destroying <name type="GPE">America</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-It truly is a small world after all!

-<name type="PERSON">Alex</name>, is that true?

</line>


<line>
Okay, yes. It's true.

</line>


<line>
I was a deep-cover KGB operative

before I went into my coma.

</line>


<line>
I've been trying to contact

my handler in <name type="GPE">Russia</name>,

but I can't reach him

and I don't know if I ever will.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Aww!

</line>


<line>
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

</line>


<line>
He's a soviet sleeper-agent

who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

</line>


<line>
I felt totally alone in this world

before I met <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

</line>


<line>
And then I met all of you, my friends.

</line>


<line>
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

just because I think

you're all capitalist swine

and want to see your way

of life destroyed, well, so be it.

</line>


<line>
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.

-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

</line>


<line>
-That's not even good wordplay.

-Wait, how did you know all this?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, were you spying on him?

-He is literally a spy

trying to destroy <name type="GPE">America</name>,

the country we all live in.

</line>


<line>
How am I the bad guy here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I am really bumping on

the whole you-not-liking-<name type="PERSON">Alex</name> of it all.

</line>


<line>
-You told me you were going to drop it.

-Yeah, but--

</line>


<line>
I don't care about <name type="PERSON">Alex</name>.

</line>


<line>
I want to know what happened

to the amazing guy

</line>


<line>
I spent the last few days with,

because if this is who you are,

</line>


<line>
I don't think I like it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Alex</name>, would you take me back

to my sister's place?

</line>


<line>
Sure thing, <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

And I can get you there fast

because I'm always Russian.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Aww!

</line>


<line>
Seriously?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> sighs]</nonVerbComm>

[Princess Carolyn gasps]

</line>


<line>
I got here as fast as I could.

Where's the next <name type="GPE">Dakota</name> Fa--?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get what happened.

</line>


<line>
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?

I didn't want to stand up.

</line>


<line>
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

</line>


<line>
You called me all the way over here

to not get you a beer?

</line>


<line>
Why do I always do this?

I push away everyone I care about.

</line>


<line>
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

</line>


<line>
Look, you obviously really care

about this girl

and that scares you,

so you sabotage yourself.

</line>


<line>
That's my problem.

I'm too good at sabotage.

</line>


<line>
-Why am I so good at everything I do?

-Hey, I got a crazy idea.

</line>


<line>
How about you just stop sulking

and go win her back, dummy?

</line>


<line>
You're right. I gotta win her back,

put it all on the line. You know what?

</line>


<line>
I think I will have that beer,

can you get it for me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Why do I bother?

-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

</line>


<line>
Actually, I want both beers!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>.

-What do you want, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
There's something I gotta say.

When I was--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>! There's something I gotta say!

-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

</line>


<line>
I never should have tried

to make your thing my thing!

</line>


<line>
I just got excited and wanted to smear

Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

</line>


<line>
I should have been supporting you,

like this support beam.

</line>


<line>
-Or a different support beam.

-It's my fault.

</line>


<line>
The point of Disneyland isn't

to make money and win lawsuits.

</line>


<line>
But I forgot that.

</line>


<line>
So, these two were so consumed

by greed that it destroyed them.

</line>


<line>
You know, I came here today

to blow up Disneyland.

</line>


<line>
-You what?

-But now I realize,

</line>


<line>
I don't need to take down capitalism.

</line>


<line>
Capitalism sows the seeds

for its own destruction.

</line>


<line>
It's a snake that eats itself.

It's only a matter of time.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whistling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no, no. No!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gabe</name> Jr.!

</line>


<line>
Quick, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>! The mattress pile!

</line>


<line>
Jump to safety! No!

</line>


<line>
Bees, help!

Your queen commands you!

</line>


<line>
No! Bees! Come on!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-You gotta-- Over the--

-What is it, boy? What's wrong?

</line>


<line>
-Hey, there's trouble.

-Did some kid fall down a well?

</line>


<line>
No, no, no! Listen.

</line>


<line>
He's trying to tell us

a kid fell down a well.

</line>


<line>
-Let's go, go, go! Come on!

-Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, listen!

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, we need to talk.

</line>


<line>
-But the fire.

-I don't care about that.

</line>


<line>
Look, the great guy you've been

getting to know, that's me.

</line>


<line>
That other guy,

the guy from the party,

that's me too and you need

to know that. I'm not perfect.

</line>


<line>
I'm cynical and I'm possessive

and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

</line>


<line>
I'm not always the best

at being not terrible.

</line>


<line>
I gotta say,

I'm not loving this pitch so far.

</line>


<line>
But I want to be better,

I'm trying to be better.

</line>


<line>
And when I'm around you,

for the first time in 30 years,

</line>


<line>
I feel like I can be.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>, you make me want

to be a better man.

</line>


<line>
Wow. That's a great line.

</line>


<line>
-Did you just come up with that?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Hey, boys and girls,

this is your park DJ speaking.

</line>


<line>
And as the <ital>Titanic's </ital>band played on

as the ship sank,

so too will I spin one last record

as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

</line>

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
-You saved me!

-No.

</line>


<line>
I saved us.

</line>


<line>
Woo-hoo!

</line>


<line>
-I want to give this a real shot.

-I don't know, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I just got out of my coma,

and I don't have time to waste

if you're still figuring your shit out.

</line>


<line>
Plus, it's hard to think straight

with this fire everywhere.

</line>


<line>
-Move in with me.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I know it feels fast.

We barely know each other.

</line>


<line>
It's crazy, but I like you.

</line>


<line>
And sometimes you gotta swing

for the fences, right?

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Let's move in together.

Let's do it.

</line>


<line>
It's crazy, but let's do it!
