-She was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get us all killed.

</line>


<line>
All right! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was acting.

</line>


<line>
Hey, so, this has been real,

but since it's our last day,

it feels like maybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld call it

on the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le us sleeping together thing.

</line>


<line>
I don't usually keep dating co-stars

once we've wrapped.

</line>


<line>
Would you say we're<ital> co-stars?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I mean, I'm <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.

I'd say we're more like both in the cast?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, let's definitely

pump the brakes on this.

</line>


<line>
And we're set. Action!

</line>


<line>
I had no c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice.

He was strangling my wife!

</line>


<line>
What did you do with the bodies?

</line>


<line>
I-- It's all a blur.

It feels like a dream.

</line>


<line>
-Where are the bodies, <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>?

-I buried them.

</line>


<line>
-In the same place I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> bury you.

</line>


<line>
-Right here.

-Oh!

Great work, everyone!

I want you all to know

I'm proud of what I've done here.

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>errific job. Seriously...

What the hell are goof-berries?

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles] I love the sign.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u better.

</line>


<line>
I basically had to go

through a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le pen on that thing.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Hey, I'd help you with your bag,

</line>


<line>
-but you know, my back.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
It's cool that you came

through <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>s Angeles on your way <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I guess we got lucky.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only flight from <name type="GPE">Connecticut</name> to <name type="GPE">Kansas</name>

had a one-night layover in <name type="GPE">California</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. [sighs]

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u okay?

</line>


<line>
-I broke up with my fireman.

-Not <name type="PERSON">Steve</name>!

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, not <name type="PERSON">Steve</name>. It was <name type="PERSON">Doug</name>.

</line>


<line>
Not <name type="PERSON">Doug</name>! Forgot there was a new one!

</line>


<line>
I am so done

with these sexy noble hero h<name type="ORG">un</name>ks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he sex is great,

but the emotional connection

just is not there.

</line>


<line>
It was the same with me and <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>landa.

</line>


<line>
No emotional connection,

but the no-sex was amazing.

</line>


<line>
None of the best sex I ever had.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

I was actually thinking about that.

</line>


<line>
Remember that idea you had

about the dating app for asexuals?

</line>


<line>
-Nope!

-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne clicking]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, here we go. <ital><music>♪ <name type="PERSON">T</name>a-da-da-da! ♪</music></ital>

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld get yourself out there.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were the best boyfriend I ever had.

</line>


<line>
If only there was a version of you

I could have sex with, I'd be all set.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a, <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>. I just got a crazy idea.

-What?

</line>


<line>
A restaurant where the menus

are printed on <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rlic bread,

</line>


<line>
so after you order,

the first course is the menu!

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clock ticking]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, ever since<ital> <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> </ital>wrapped

earlier today,

the question on everybody's mind is,

</line>


<line>
"What's Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

going to do next?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a serious actor now,

so I guess, narrate a documentary

about global warming,

and then take a private jet

to the premiere?

</line>


<line>
I've been looking for new projects.

</line>


<line>
Seems like everything's based

on books these days,

so I went to the book store

to scout some material.

</line>


<line>
-Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

-But all the books are so long now.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> has the time?

</line>


<line>
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,

then see the movie,

and decide if the book the movie

is based on would make a good movie.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's a good strategy.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I was heading to the door

in book-length-related frustration...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
...when I saw

one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se circular greeting card racks.

</line>


<line>
Spotted a card that looked interesting,

and it's a super-quick read.

</line>


<line>
-[flutters]

-Eh...?

</line>


<line>
-"Happy Birthday, <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

-Pretty cool dad, huh?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want to option this greeting card

for a movie?

</line>


<line>
-We'll call it <ital>Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.</ital>

-But what is it?

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>? M<name type="PERSON">mm</name>... it's... "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

</line>


<line>
Oh. Okay.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think we can get the film rights?

-I'll look into it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[moans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[giggles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> So, then <name type="PERSON">Joby</name> was like,

</line>


<line>
"Uh, nice scr<name type="ORG">un</name>chie, Professor."

</line>


<line>
It was literally a thing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Joby</name> is the guy in your dorm

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> plays guitar?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, he's really f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny,

but like soulful f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny, you know?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's great.

-Oh...!

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I always t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

I would make a good college person.

</line>


<line>
Roaming the campus,

sticking it to the crusty old dean

with my rowdy 'tude,

having friends, and learning things,

and just, uh, being yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u okay?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look as if you saw <ital>G<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st in the <name type="ORG">Shell</name></ital>

and you're <name type="PERSON">Scarlett Johansson's</name> publicist.

</line>


<line>
It's weird to be back in this <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is where it all happened

with your mom.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is so weird.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a. It's okay.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's ancient history.

</line>


<line>
My mom is dead, so nobody is going

to drug you with <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret pills. All right?

</line>


<line>
Now, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w about we make new, f<name type="ORG">un</name>, memories

to cancel out the old ones?

</line>


<line>
-Can the new memories be pizza-related?

-No doy!

</line>


<line>
Ah, thank you for meeting me

on such s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt notice.

</line>


<line>
It's nice to see you.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure Fridays

must be a big night for you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were probably planning on going out

to a nice dinner with your new girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Or seeing a movie

with your new<ital> girlfriend?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Or staying in and watching cable--

</line>


<line>
I get what you're asking. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he answer is,

no, I don't have cable anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Or a new girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
I'm not seeing anyone either.

I've just been so busy with my<ital> <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have a <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I'm producing.

</line>


<line>
Not the baby we really wanted

but never had.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, that's great, too.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter wants

to option this card as a movie.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.</ital>

-How is it a movie?

</line>


<line>
-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. It's "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

-Oh. Okay.

</line>


<line>
-[ringtone playing]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-Yeah. Sure.

</line>


<line>
-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne beeps]

-Hello?

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>racy]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Can you get to the St. Bernard</ital>

<ital>Medical Center in like, a half <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh, I think so. Why?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I just got my tonsils taken out,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-and I need a ride <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.</ital>

-What?

</line>


<line>
Nah, I'm just messing with you.

A pregnant lady doesn't want the baby.

</line>


<line>
If you can get there tonight,

the baby's yours.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>onight? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's so--

she doesn't even know me.

</line>


<line>
Hey, man. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't say no to free baby.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Okay.

</line>


<line>
Is everything okay?

</line>


<line>
I have to drive my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital

to the car right now!

</line>


<line>
I'm a baby,

and there's adopting on the way!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're adopting?

-Vroom-vroom!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's so much food in my lap!

Doesn't matter! It's fine!

</line>


<line>
-All part of being a mother!

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are really freaking out.

</line>


<line>
Am I freaking out too much? Or not enough?

</line>


<line>
-Let me drive you.

-But I have the car seat in my car.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey won't let you go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut one.

It's the only rule, really.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be more rules,

but w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> am I to judge?

</line>


<line>
-[breathing heavily]

-Hey, breathe.

</line>


<line>
I'll get the car seat. Let's go.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. I ate too much.

</line>


<line>
I need ice cream

to smoosh the rest of it down.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't keep j<name type="ORG">un</name>k food in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

ever since last night

when I ate all of my ice cream.

</line>


<line>
Hey, why do you have a vodka bottle

for every day of the week?

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's just my new system I'm trying.

I'm down to one bottle a day.

</line>


<line>
-Is this like an <name type="ORG">AA</name> thing?

-No, I don't need <name type="ORG">AA</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Would you get outta there?

-I want ice cream.

</line>


<line>
-Give me your keys.

-What? No.

</line>


<line>
-Come on. Let me drive the <name type="PERSON">T</name>esla.

-With your greasy pizza fingers?

</line>


<line>
-Forget it.

-Come on! [giggling]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Ooh!

</line>


<line>
What the hell are these?

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se...

</line>


<line>
Why was this in your pocket?

Are these for me?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck. <name type="PERSON">God</name>, no.

</line>


<line>
Oh <name type="PERSON">God</name>, did you put this in my pizza?

</line>


<line>
What? Of course not. <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

No. Give me the-- no!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Oop</name>s.

-<name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se were for my back!

-Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. Is everything okay?

-I need to talk to someone,

and you're the only person I knew

would be available on a Friday night,

</line>


<line>
-with nothing to do.

-Hey, I almost went to the movies tonight!

</line>


<line>
It's not my fault there's never anything

in the 8:00 <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur.

</line>


<line>
9:15 is too late. 7:00 is too early.

When am I supposed to eat dinner?

</line>


<line>
Uh, sneak in a bag of mashed potatoes

like the rest of us?

</line>


<line>
-Is this your w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le apartment?

-It's a studio.

</line>


<line>
I ate l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch with a studio head

just yesterday.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <ital>not </ital>a studio.

-What do you need, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

</line>


<line>

did something really nice for me,

and I wanna pay her back.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you could help me brainstorm.

-Okay. What kind of things does she like?

</line>


<line>
Well, sex, for one.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d for her!

A woman needs to know her own body

before she expects someone else

to know her body.

</line>


<line>
-What? What are we talking about?

-What?

</line>


<line>
I think sex, for one?

</line>


<line>
Oh! <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, you sad-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>med genius.

</line>

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've cracked it!

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm sorry. I freaked out.

-It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur generation's been brainwashed

by <name type="PERSON">McG</name>ruff the Crime Dog.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>, by the way, I met at a party once?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>dn't ask me a single question about me.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and also

because of the time I overdosed on pills.

</line>


<line>
Right, well, these were good pills.

</line>


<line>
I told you I'm on a system now.

I'm not "doing drugs." <name type="PERSON">T</name>his was medicine.

</line>


<line>
Can you get more?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure.

I'll just call the pharmacy and say,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, girl, you know

that highly-addictive opioid

</line>


<line>
I'm supposed to take every three <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs?

Well, I kind of misplaced them,

so could I just get some more?

I'm totally not a drug addict."

</line>


<line>
-I'm really sorry.

-No. It's fine.

</line>


<line>
Let's enjoy our time together,

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh I'm in tremendous pain.

</line>


<line>
I'll try to forget it,

but the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time

we might be thinking about it.

</line>


<line>
I do not blame you, but if you

blame yourself, that is okay with me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u must know a place

you can get more painkillers.

</line>


<line>
I do know a guy,

but he's somewhat "south of <name type="ORG">Pico</name>,"

if you know what I mean.

</line>


<line>
I don't. Why do <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>s Angeles people think

everyone else <name type="ORG">un</name>derstands

your local references?

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, let's go.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe you're adopting.

</line>


<line>

I just remember you were so adamant

even when I said we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld talk

about other options.

</line>

-Yeah?

Well, one day,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a great dad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a huge wake-up call for me.

</line>


<line>
Next morning I looked in the mirror,

It's like I completely regenerated

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u'd have to be a real lost cause

not to seek help

after losing <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> like that,

don't you think?

Oh, <name type="PERSON">deffo</name>. I mean, you know, get help

</line>


<line>
I threw out his pills because of my trauma

from when I got drugged by his mama.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got drugged by your own mother?

-No, my mother.

</line>


<line>
Her mother was a maid

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> got knocked up by my dad,

but she got adopted by eight other dads.

</line>


<line>
Okay, do you know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w many times

I hear this story every week?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his story, specifically?

Even the "eight dads" part?

I don't know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you think you're fooling,

after s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting was over to try

to have a real relationship.

</line>


<line>

I didn't deserve that?

-Yeah.

-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.

Do you ever think about

what it would be like if we dated now?

I don't know. What would it be like?

<line>
I guess we'd hang out together,

like we already do.

</line>


<line>
And you would be my favorite person,

like you already are.

</line>


<line>
And when something good happened to me,

like if I got a promotion at work,

you'd be the first person I'd tell,

and you'd smile and say,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's my boyfriend."

<line>
