What troubles you, Sister?

</line>


<line>
It's the woman w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> came from the water.

She's been in our care for two years.

</line>


<line>
She hasn't spoken a word

and spends her days in a fog.

</line>


<line>
Have you been steadfast in your prayers?

</line>


<line>
I have. And yet,

her condition does not improve.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"And</name> yet"? Is prayer but a bar<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

</line>


<line>
Is it for <ital>you </ital>to present terms

to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ther. I just--

</line>

Yes, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ther.

Can you feel that on your feet?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's water. Water.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">ho</name>peless! I want to help you,

but I don't even know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are!

I look at your face and think

you could be literally anyone.

It's basically a feeding tube.

Are you in that much pain right now?

"Surprising depth"?

<line>
Why can't it just be "depth"?

</line>


<line>
I'd hate to see you after a bad review.

<line>
Oh, and I bet "eponymous"

was supposed to be a p<name type="ORG">un</name> on "pony."

in a review before.

"Her restrained performance

crackles with nuance and power."

</line>


<line>
Damn, look at me-- in two sentences.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't let it go to your head.

Probably just because you're a good actor.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I got you something

for the premiere party.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese are beautiful, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

-Well, don't let it go to your head.

<line>
It's because you visited me

in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital every day,

and I got used to having you aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

and it turns out I like you.

Well, that'll give you plenty of time

<line>
If this gets out, everyone will be talking

about the stolen <name type="PERSON">ga</name>g,

instead of all the great parts of the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

<line>
Fine. What do you want?

-What?

I can only give permission

for the part I wrote.

<line>
I'm the set-up guy.

</line>


<line>
If you want the p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch line,

you gotta talk to <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can you ask him to sign the release?

</line>


<line>
I can't even ask him the best time

to go to the dentist.

</line>


<line>
He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.

and read in ma<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zines,

<name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> wore it better?"

Let me tell you something,

-Oh. Hey.

-What happened to your arm?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, just some ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le got <name type="PERSON">T</name>-boned by me.

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. When?

</line>


<line>
Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?

<line>
As <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> says, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>ime is like a woman;

completely impossible to comprehend."

</line>


<line>
I think we ended up cutting that line

because the network was worried

it would be offensive

to people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> didn't know

what time it was.

In fact, that's my signature move.

But if <name type="PERSON">Abe</name>l signed it, I won't.

<line>
No, such a realization would only crush

my too-feeble heart.

After all, what benefit is it to love

<line>
Hello, everyone.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for attending the premiere

of my opus.

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe you all enjoy it

because that means you are smart.

</line>


<line>
If you don't get it, that means

that my genius wasn't appreciated

in my own time, and that's okay, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[weak laughter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Why are you laughing?

Please do not laugh during the screening.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his episode contains

no intentional humor.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Okay. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's--

that's always a good sign,

when you have to clarify that.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, folks, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> is being modest.

</line>


<line>
-"<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>"?

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I say <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> is being modest,

but he put together a tremendous s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

that I think that you guys

are really <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> love.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right.

It all came out of this brain.

</line>


<line>
-Ha! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat brain, he says?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat brain? Double-ha!

</line>


<line>
Shh!

</line>


<line>
And the most amazing thing about this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

is that I'm sure we all have <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>s

in our lives,

or we are <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>s.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, we've all done terrible things

that we deeply regret.

</line>


<line>
I've done so many... <name type="ORG">un</name>forgivable things.

</line>


<line>
And I think that,

that's what this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w says.

</line>


<line>
Is that... is that we're all terrible,

so therefore we're all... okay.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
And I think

that's a really powerful message.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut further ado,

the first chapter,

and notice I said "chapter" not episode

because I think of this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w as more

of a novel than a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w...

<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, where have you been?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u left after, like, ten minutes.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
My friend <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name>, not my best friend <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name>,

but another <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name> w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is my friend,

was having a crisis,

and I needed to text her "LOL."

</line>


<line>
Well, you missed the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le episode.

</line>


<line>
I saw the first ten minutes!

I just couldn't get into it.

</line>


<line>
And you kept saying,

</line>


<line>
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?

How did you like that scene?"

</line>


<line>
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?

How did you like that scene?

</line>


<line>
Every time you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed up on screen,

I kept thinking,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not a dirty cop,

that's my boyfriend!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he sweetest, cutest dog

in the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le world!"

</line>


<line>
And then you'd s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot someone,

and I was like... eww!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name> is the hardest I've ever acted.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,

but it was fake ice.

I wanted you to see it.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to fix this.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u stay here and party.

</line>


<line>
I'll go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

I'll watch the entire season of your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to do that.

</line>


<line>
And you don't have to like every one

of my <name type="ORG">Instagram</name> posts, but you do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he least I could do

is watch your <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

even if it kills me

because I hate it so much.

</line>


<line>
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.

-I'm going to do this for us.

</line>


<line>
-But--

-I love you!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[buzzing]

</line>


<line>
I've been to dozens of these things

and I've never heard applause like that.

</line>


<line>
We might actually get a season two.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's never happened to me before.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

can I borrow you for a few minutes?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, sure. <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, do you mind if I, um...?

-Yeah, go ahead.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I was actually talking to <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.

Yeah, yeah. Sure.

</line>


<line>
Wow. Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you doing? Hey, you came!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, I screwed up.

I didn't know it would feel like that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o be in that room.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>o hear people cheering <ital>for <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What are you talking about?

-When I first started on this job,

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make <ital><name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name></ital>

more well-ro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded,

so the audience

could relate to him better.

</line>


<line>
And now you're upset

because I didn't mention you

in my introduction.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le point of television

is it's a collaborative medium,

</line>


<line>
-where one person gets all the credit.

-No, it's not about that.

</line>


<line>
I made him more vulnerable,

and that made him more likable,

which makes for a better <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
But if <ital><name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name></ital> is just a way

to help dumb ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>les<ital> </ital>rationalize

their own awful behavior,

well, I'm sorry,

but we can't put this out there.

</line>


<line>
Uh, it's out there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le season's dropping at midnight

all over the world.

</line>


<line>
-I can't be here.

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name> sighs]

</line>


<line>
Come on, fellas.

I know we can find a solution here.

</line>


<line>
I doubt it.

</line>


<line>
We have the same problem

as a hematology lab

that goes a week wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut electricity!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>oo much bad blood!

</line>


<line>
But you obviously work together so well.

What went wrong?

</line>


<line>
It was a long time ago.

</line>


<line>
My wife <name type="PERSON">Harriet</name>

always had a sneaker for <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and the <name type="ORG">un</name>spoken resentment crept in?

</line>


<line>
Unspoken? It was s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uted!

</line>


<line>
Nevertheless, me and <name type="PERSON">Harriet</name> ended up

having a fling.

</line>


<line>
Eventually, we got married.

</line>


<line>
-And that killed the partnership?

-No, we got over that.

</line>


<line>
But at their tenth anniversary,

I had a few too many--

</line>


<line>
And what, you took a swing at him?

</line>


<line>
I said I always felt

he had the easier job,

coming up with the p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch lines.

</line>


<line>
And then what? What led to the rift?

</line>


<line>
Led? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le rift!

He besmirched my craft.

</line>


<line>
I still haven't forgiven

the son of a bitch!

</line>


<line>
I said it then, and I stand by it now!

</line>


<line>
All the pressure's on the p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch line!

</line>


<line>
Pressure? Please!

</line>


<line>
Set-ups need context,

mise-en-scène, flavor!

</line>


<line>
I carried us to the top

of the <name type="ORG">Popsicle</name> stick <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wrote the part

they let you try before you buy!

</line>


<line>
I had to deliver the money line!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ugh!

</line>


<line>
So, you both think you had the harder job?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Abe</name>l] Of course!

-Indubitably!

</line>


<line>
Well, what if you tried switching roles?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean, I tag <ital>his </ital>set-ups?

-Why not?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

I'm a p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch line guy my w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life.

</line>


<line>
How do I come up with straight lines?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u could try using a ruler.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both laugh]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I missed you, <name type="PERSON">Abe</name>l!

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u, too, Zig!

</line>


<line>
All right, so we have a deal?

</line>


<line>
What did the terminally ill man say

to Dr. Kevorkian?

</line>


<line>
"Give me that sweet release!"

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you really mean what you said,

before the screening?

</line>


<line>
About <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> made you feel okay,

about yourself?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know--

</line>


<line>
Because, you know,

that's not the point of <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>--

for guys to watch it and feel okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, it's a compliment.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did a good job. Relax.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you, or anyone else,

justifying their shitty behavior

because of the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
What is your problem?

</line>


<line>
Why can't you accept

that something you did is successful?

</line>


<line>
It's connecting to people,

and that's good.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right, sorry.

I don't know why I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you would care.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me?

-What is going on with you? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a mess.

</line>


<line>
-Am I?

-I feel like I barely know you anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.

</line>


<line>
-It's true. I don't know you.

-No. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know me. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen what the hell happened in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I...

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you think

that you know--

</line>


<line>
I don't know anything!

</line>


<line>
I mean, I know something happened

with a girl in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

and I know it resulted in

you coming <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me in a boat.

</line>


<line>
-Well, that's--

-I also know...

that your old friend <name type="PERSON">Char</name>lotte

lives in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>

because you used to leave

her business card lying aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

and I know her daughter is a senior

at <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>.

</line>


<line>
-How--?

-And I know you went to <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>

during your bender three years ago

because a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of students

posted pictures of you on <name type="ORG">Facebook</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ,

why are you so obsessed with me?

</line>


<line>
I am not obsessed.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to know what happened,

and you wouldn't tell me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u never asked!

-Okay, so I'm asking now.

</line>


<line>
What happened in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Hallo! Smile for <name type="ORG">Ya<name type="PERSON">ho</name>o</name>, <name type="GPE">Finland</name>!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>


<line>
What I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand is why you feel

like you deserve to know

every shitty thing I ever did.

</line>


<line>
I don't deserve anything.

</line>


<line>
I would like to know

when you've done shitty things.

</line>


<line>
Why is that your business?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm your friend,

and I care about you,

and I wrote a book about you,

and now I wrote this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w for you,

and I am very publicly your friend,

so if it gets out that you're doing

creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.

</line>


<line>
Oh! So you're worried about things

that I may have done

because you think

that it reflects badly on <ital>you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>rts your brand?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's your moral high gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not about "moral high gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d."

</line>


<line>
Wanna know about <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want to know about the one

little thing that I did in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

which, by the way,

wasn't even really a thing?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what? Spare me.

-No, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell you.

</line>


<line>
I'll tell you what you want.

</line>


<line>
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about

what happened at the <name type="ORG">M<name type="PERSON">T</name>V</name> beach <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
Or why I'm not allowed

to fly United anymore?

</line>


<line>
Or what happened with <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>,

the makeup lady on <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>g Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Or the dozens of other shady things

that may or may not have occurred

in my life that I can barely even remember

</line>


<line>
'cause I was high or dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

or it was 30 years ago?

</line>


<line>
And you don't feel bad,

about any of this stuff?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, of course I do!

I've spent so much time feeling bad.

</line>


<line>
By the way, most of these women...

don't even remember, I bet.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's really convenient for you.

</line>


<line>
I'm the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has to live with this shit.

</line>


<line>
I'm the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has to feel the guilt

all day, every day.

</line>


<line>
So, you're the victim here?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and I know

that's not the woke, progressive,

inter<name type="ORG">sec</name>tionally appropriate thing to say,

but I would say, yeah!

</line>


<line>
I'm the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has suffered the most

because of the actions of <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've </ital>suffered?

-Yeah, I have!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he most?</ital>

<ital>-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he most!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Really? <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>re than, say, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Don't talk to me about her.

</line>


<line>
No, I wanna know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <ital>you're </ital>the victim

of the <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> story.

</line>


<line>
-I'm serious.

-Explain to me...

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s overdose was

really rough for you.

</line>


<line>
-Shut up.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u feel a lot of guilt about that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u feel a lot of guilt because you were

the only father figure she ever had,

and when she came to you for help, you--

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you doing?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u folks having a good time?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look great. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for coming.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with her?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's-- ! No.

</line>


<line>
And then when she was sober,

you took her on a month-long bender?

</line>


<line>
And then she died. And she is dead now.

And you're still alive.

</line>


<line>
With a girlfriend, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is also alive,

and a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
And that's been really hard for <ital>you,</ital>

the main character in this story.

</line>


<line>
Why are you bringing this shit up?

Is this f<name type="ORG">un</name> for you?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>o really rub in--

-It's not <ital>f<name type="ORG">un</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u win! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u scored all the points

in the argument!

</line>


<line>
According to facts, you are right

and I am wrong, like always.

</line>


<line>
But you know what? I don't care.

Because I'm trying to move forward.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u haven't changed at all.

</line>


<line>
Yes! Congratulations!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are the last person to get that.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> <ital>change.</ital>

I don't need your <ital>help for changing,</ital>

so you can stop trying

to make me your project.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not--

-When I met you, I was depressed

because I didn't like myself.

</line>


<line>
And when you wrote that book

and sold a bajillion copies,

you taught me that as screwed up

as I am, that's okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u </ital>did that. And now I'm okay.

</line>


<line>
I don't believe that's true.

</line>


<line>
And I don't think you believe it's true.

</line>


<line>
I think you want me to tell you

that you can be better.

</line>


<line>
And even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh you're being

a total ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le right now,

</line>


<line>
I still believe it.

</line>


<line>
If all you've gotten

out of this friendship,

is the idea that you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be okay

with yourself, as you are,

then I don't think

this is a good relationship...

for either of us.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, come on.

-I'm going <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, we're saying things,

but let's just go back to the party.

</line>


<line>
I'm done... with all of this.

</line>


<line>
I went to <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name> to see <name type="PERSON">Char</name>lotte.

</line>


<line>
She was married with a daughter.

</line>


<line>
But it wasn't like...

what you're thinking.

</line>


<line>
She was 17, which is the le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l age

of consent in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

and she wasn't dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k, so,

not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Char</name>lotte, I mean,
