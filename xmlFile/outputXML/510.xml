<line>
What troubles you, Sister?

</line>


<line>
It's the woman who came from the water.

She's been in our care for two years.

</line>


<line>
She hasn't spoken a word

and spends her days in a fog.

</line>


<line>
Have you been steadfast in your prayers?

</line>


<line>
I have. And yet,

her condition does not improve.

</line>


<line>
"And yet"? Is prayer but a bargain?

</line>


<line>
Is it for <ital>you </ital>to present terms

to the Lord?

</line>


<line>
No, Mother. I just--

</line>


<line>
You seek a sign from <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

Should He seek <ital>less </ital>from you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Take the woman to the seaside

tomorrow after <name type="PERSON">Matins</name>.

</line>


<line>
Prove your faith to Him

that He might reveal His glory to you.

</line>


<line>
Yes, Mother.

</line>


<line>
Can you feel that on your feet?

</line>


<line>
That's water. Water.

</line>


<line>
This is hopeless! I want to help you,

but I don't even know who you are!

</line>


<line>
I look at your face and think

you could be literally anyone.

</line>


<line>
Are you a federal judge? A Russian spy?

</line>


<line>
-A proud <name type="NORP">Southern</name> matriarch?

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Bo... <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

<line>
Gah! <name type="PERSON">Bleh</name>! Agh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moans]</nonVerbComm> Ow...!

</line>


<line>
-Come on, get up. We're gonna be late.

-How have I gained weight?

</line>


<line>
Spent two weeks in a hospital

hooked up to a feeding tube.

</line>


<line>
You drank milkshakes.

That's not a feeding tube.

</line>


<line>
It's basically a feeding tube.

</line>


<line>
How many do you take a day?

Are you in that much pain right now?

</line>


<line>
-I'm about to be. Reviews are out.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>"Philbert </ital>is an astonishment,

</line>


<line>
with <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name> bringing surprising depth

to the eponymous character."

</line>


<line>
"Surprising depth"?

<name type="PERSON">God</name>, they always gotta slant it.

</line>


<line>
Why can't it just be "depth"?

</line>


<line>
I'd hate to see you after a bad review.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and I bet "eponymous"

was supposed to be a pun on "pony."

</line>


<line>
Wait. There's a part about me.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> <name type="PERSON">Cazador</name> also appears

as <name type="ORG">Sassy</name> Malone."

</line>


<line>
Wow, I've never been mentioned

in a review before.

</line>


<line>
"Her restrained performance

crackles with nuance and power."

</line>


<line>
Damn, look at me-- in two sentences.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't let it go to your head.

Probably just because you're a good actor.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I got you something

for the premiere party.

</line>


<line>
-These are beautiful, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

-Well, don't let it go to your head.

</line>


<line>
It's because you visited me

in the hospital every day,

and I got used to having you around,

and it turns out I like you.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. I let them go to my head.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[elevator dings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
"What separates <ital>Philbert</ital>

is the character's vulnerability.

</line>


<line>
This is not the sad man

as suave and cynical anti-hero,

but a barely scabbed-over wound

of a person."

</line>


<line>
"Barely scabbed-over."

Congratulations.

</line>


<line>
You're the one

who took a stock bad-boy detective

and made him into a wound.

</line>


<line>
Me? No.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-You're coming to the premiere party?</ital>

-Already on my way.

</line>


<line>
My apartment is a two-hour drive

from everywhere.

</line>


<line>
Seven miles, two hours.

</line>


<line>
-How is that possible?

-Honk, honk!

</line>


<line>
Well, that'll give you plenty of time

</line>


<line>
to come up with a few spontaneous remarks

for the red carpet.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] <ital>Oh, do I have to do that?</ital>

-Look, I gotta go. You'll be great.

</line>


<line>
-Just be charmingly effusive. Be yourself.

<ital>-I can't be both of those things at once!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Can I help you?

-Abel <name type="PERSON">Ziegler</name>.

</line>


<line>
I saw the trailer

for your new show <ital>Philbert,</ital>

and I think you oughta see this. [slurps]

</line>


<line>
"What did the clam say to the crab

at the undersea ball?"

</line>


<line>
I think you know why I'm here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fish.

</line>


<line>
Well, buddy, these past few months,

you have been inappropriate

</line>


<line>
with every person

who's come to our apartment.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>I want to be inside you.</ital>

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>, you <ital>are </ital>inside of me.

You always have been.

</line>


<line>
But there's nowhere else I can take you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Let's get down to business.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You want me to take you to work?

No way!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Oh, yes!</ital>

-No!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! </ital>[banging]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!</ital>

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
I need you to be

on your best behavior today.

</line>


<line>
<ital>That is the stuff I like.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I also like clearly defined expectations.

</line>


<line>
It seems we understand each other.

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ Bow-chicka wow-wow</ital>

<ital>Chicka-wow-wow ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[crashes]

<ital>-Mmm-ch, mmm-ch!</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, tonight, are we, like,

together-together at this thing?

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, well...

</line>


<line>
I mean, I know we're together.

I just meant publicly.

</line>


<line>
Like, are we gonna introduce the world

to "BoJina"?

</line>


<line>
Well, yeah, I just... I'm not sure

the world is ready for, um, BoJina.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah, you're probably right.

-[phone chimes]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> What do you want,

Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Gotcha! It's not Steven Spielberg.

I changed my name in your contacts.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> groans]

-<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> wants to say "hi."

</line>


<line>
-<ital>What pickles?</ital>

-Hi, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
Uh, hello. Are you the pickles?

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I'm <ital>the </ital><name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>,

but maybe one day.

</line>


<line>
-Right now I'm just a waitress.

<ital>-Oh, right. The waitress.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't know if I'm <ital>the </ital>waitress.

</line>


<line>
She's being modest.

She's a waitress-<ital>slash-</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>aspiring <name type="ORG">Instagram</name> influencer.</ital>

-What?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Is that <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

<ital>-Wow.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Peanutbutter,

and also <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> on the same phone call?

</line>


<line>
What is this?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what this is.

Why did you call me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Oh, yeah!</ital>

</line>


<line>
You wanna ride with me and <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>

to the premiere?

</line>


<line>
It'll be like this, but for 40 minutes.

</line>


<line>
-Hard no.

-Hardly no?

</line>


<line>
-That sounds like a yes.

-<ital>Okay, bye.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Well, anyway-- hello?

</line>


<line>
Huh. He must have accidentally hung up,

right after he accidentally said,

"Okay, bye."

</line>


<line>
As the clam said to the crab

at the undersea ball...

</line>


<line>
"Shell we dance?"

</line>


<line>
There are some superficial similarities.

</line>


<line>
Superficial, shmuperficial!

It's the same line!

</line>


<line>
-Doesn't mean I stole it!

-<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>.

</line>


<line>
I spent months on that line.

I slaved, finessed, crafted.

</line>


<line>
The world was a block of marble,

and, like <name type="PERSON">Michelangelo</name>,

</line>


<line>
I chiseled it into my <name type="PERSON">David</name>,

as I did for each and every one

of Crazy AZ's <ital>Frozen Funnies.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Ziegler</name>, we have so much respect

for your work.

</line>


<line>
Do you think I'm like a penny

on a railroad track?

</line>


<line>
Prone to flattery?

</line>


<line>
We've got a premiere to get to.

</line>


<line>
How long do we have to listen to this guy

do his <name type="ORG">Popsicle</name> schtick?

</line>


<line>
It's pronounced "stick," idiot.

</line>


<line>
Play nice, <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>.

</line>


<line>
If this gets out, everyone will be talking

about the stolen gag,

instead of all the great parts of the show

that weren't stolen.

</line>


<line>
Fine. What do you want?

</line>


<line>
I want what every comedy writer wants.

<ital>Respect!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh! What if I just let you come

to the premiere party with us?

</line>


<line>
They have tiny tacos in soft shells

that are impossible to fold

without making a big mess.

</line>


<line>
I accept your terms. Where do I sign?

</line>


<line>
-Can we go now?

-Wait.

</line>


<line>
"Abel <name type="PERSON">Ziegler</name> ampersand"?

What are you ampersanding?

</line>


<line>
-My former writing partner, <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name> Abler.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I can only give permission

for the part I wrote.

</line>


<line>
I'm the set-up guy.

</line>


<line>
If you want the punch line,

you gotta talk to <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can you ask him to sign the release?

</line>


<line>
I can't even ask him the best time

to go to the dentist.

</line>


<line>
He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.

</line>


<line>
-Now, you mentioned a party?

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name> groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutters clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>]</nonVerbComm> Wow!

</line>


<line>
A real Hollywoo premiere party.

</line>


<line>
Can we get our pictures taken,

and drink specialty cocktails,

and form life-long bonds

with other fancy celebrities,

and read in magazines,

"Who wore it better?"

</line>


<line>
And then people vote,

and then 78 percent of readers say,

</line>


<line>
-"<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> did!"

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-[camera shutters clicking]

-[reporters clamoring]

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, can we get some of just you?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, uh, yeah.

-Mm-hmm. I'll see you in there.

</line>


<line>
FYI, you're gonna want pictures of her

after you see what she does in <ital>Philbert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you something,

that 39-year-old actress is going places.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Hey.

-What happened to your arm?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. When?

</line>


<line>
Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?

</line>


<line>
As Philbert says, "<name type="ORG">Time</name> is like a woman;

completely impossible to comprehend."

</line>


<line>
I think we ended up cutting that line

because the network was worried

it would be offensive

to people who didn't know

what time it was.

</line>


<line>
-[clattering]

-This you call a tip?

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen a tip this measly

since my bris.

</line>


<line>
You must be <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name> Abler.

Oh, thank you so much for coming.

</line>


<line>
Darling, you're wasting your time.

</line>


<line>
I love to sign documents.

In fact, that's my signature move.

</line>


<line>
But if Abel signed it, I won't.

</line>


<line>
I guess you could say I'm willing,

but not Abel!

</line>


<line>
-Oh...!

-Now where are those tiny tacos?

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
-[bell chimes]

-Cuckoo.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Chicka-chicka, oh, yeah.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Mmm-ch, mmm-ch!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clattering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, is it five o'clock already?

</line>


<line>
If you've poured me a drink,

you must want something.

</line>


<line>
-Out with it.

-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>I want to be on top of you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
There's no one on top of me.

I'm CEO of this company.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-That's my favorite position.</ital>

-Well, you can't have it. It's mine.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Give it to me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You want to be tantamount

to this catamount?

</line>


<line>
You've got balls, I'll give you that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clanking, whirring]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I am a horny robot.</ital>

</line>


<line>
For my job, yes, you've been quite clear.

</line>


<line>
But if you were CEO, what would I do?

</line>


<line>
Take a portraiture class

at the Learning Annex?

</line>


<line>
While away the hours,

painting canvas after canvas of my wife,

and, through this act,

rediscover the woman I fell in love with

those many years ago?

</line>


<line>
No, such a realization would only crush

my too-feeble heart.

</line>


<line>
After all, what benefit is it to love

without the words to express it?

</line>


<line>
What could I possibly say to articulate

my deep devotion to this woman,

who has become but a stranger to me now?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whirring]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I am powerless in the face</ital>

<ital>of your mesmerizing sexual energy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Such a brain for business,

yet such a tongue for poetry.

</line>


<line>
So, I am resigning from my post,

effective immediately.

</line>


<line>
I leave you in the good hands

of <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>, would you like to say a few words?

-<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>You will submit to my desires.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Very impressive.

-He's leaning in and I respect that.

</line>


<line>
-Uh... guys, are you sure about this?

-I've never been more sure about anything.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, why don't you show your new boss

around the premises?

</line>


<line>
I'm actually about to head out

to the <ital>Philbert</ital> premiere party.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>I'm coming.</ital>

-Brilliant! You'll take him with you!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no.

He doesn't need to come.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I'm coming, I'm coming.</ital>

<ital>Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm coming.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Whatever you say... boss.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[splattering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello, everyone.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for attending the premiere

of my opus.

</line>


<line>
I hope you all enjoy it

because that means you are smart.

</line>


<line>
If you don't get it, that means

that my genius wasn't appreciated

in my own time, and that's okay, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[weak laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Why are you laughing?

Please do not laugh during the screening.

</line>


<line>
This episode contains

no intentional humor.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Okay. That's--

that's always a good sign,

when you have to clarify that.

Look, folks, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> is being modest.

</line>


<line>
-"<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>"?

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>. Did I say <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> is being modest,

but he put together a tremendous show

that I think that you guys

are really gonna love.

</line>


<line>
That's right.

It all came out of this brain.

</line>


<line>
-Ha! That brain, he says?

-That brain? Double-ha!

</line>


<line>
Shh!

</line>


<line>
And the most amazing thing about this show

is that I'm sure we all have Philberts

in our lives,

or we are Philberts.

</line>


<line>
You know, we've all done terrible things

that we deeply regret.

</line>


<line>
I've done so many... unforgivable things.

</line>


<line>
And I think that,

that's what this show says.

</line>


<line>
Is that... is that we're all terrible,

so therefore we're all... okay.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
And I think

that's a really powerful message.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, without further ado,

the first chapter,

and notice I said "chapter" not episode

because I think of this show as more

of a novel than a TV show...

</line>


<line>

<nonVerbComm>[phone clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, where have you been?

You left after, like, ten minutes.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
My friend <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name>, not my best friend <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name>,

but another <name type="PERSON">Ilana</name> who is my friend,

was having a crisis,

and I needed to text her "LOL."

</line>


<line>
Well, you missed the whole episode.

</line>


<line>
I saw the first ten minutes!

I just couldn't get into it.

</line>


<line>
And you kept saying,

</line>


<line>
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?

How did you like that scene?"

</line>


<line>
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?

How did you like that scene?

</line>


<line>
Every time you showed up on screen,

I kept thinking,

</line>


<line>
"That's not a dirty cop,

that's my boyfriend!

</line>


<line>
The sweetest, cutest dog

in the whole world!"

</line>


<line>
And then you'd shoot someone,

and I was like... eww!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name> is the hardest I've ever acted.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,

but it was fake ice.

I wanted you to see it.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to fix this.

You stay here and party.

</line>


<line>
I'll go home.

I'll watch the entire season of your show.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to do that.

</line>


<line>
And you don't have to like every one

of my <name type="ORG">Instagram</name> posts, but you do.

</line>


<line>
The least I could do

is watch your TV show,

even if it kills me

because I hate it so much.

</line>


<line>
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.

-I'm going to do this for us.

</line>


<line>
-But--

-I love you!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[buzzing]

</line>


<line>
I've been to dozens of these things

and I've never heard applause like that.

</line>


<line>
We might actually get a season two.

</line>


<line>
-That's never happened to me before.

-That's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

can I borrow you for a few minutes?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, sure. <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, do you mind if I, um...?

-Yeah, go ahead.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I was actually talking to <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.

Yeah, yeah. Sure.

</line>


<line>
Wow. Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, I screwed up.

I didn't know it would feel like that.

</line>


<line>
To be in that room.

To hear people cheering <ital>for Philbert!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What are you talking about?

-When I first started on this job,

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make <ital>Philbert</ital>

more well-rounded,

so the audience

could relate to him better.

</line>


<line>
And now you're upset

because I didn't mention you

in my introduction.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, the whole point of television

is it's a collaborative medium,

</line>


<line>
-where one person gets all the credit.

-No, it's not about that.

</line>


<line>
I made him more vulnerable,

and that made him more likable,

which makes for a better TV show.

</line>


<line>
But if <ital>Philbert</ital> is just a way

to help dumb assholes<ital> </ital>rationalize

their own awful behavior,

well, I'm sorry,

but we can't put this out there.

</line>


<line>
Uh, it's out there.

</line>


<line>
The whole season's dropping at midnight

all over the world.

</line>


<line>
-I can't be here.

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name> sighs]

</line>


<line>
Come on, fellas.

I know we can find a solution here.

</line>


<line>
I doubt it.

</line>


<line>
We have the same problem

as a hematology lab

that goes a week without electricity!

</line>


<line>
Too much bad blood!

</line>


<line>
But you obviously work together so well.

What went wrong?

</line>


<line>
It was a long time ago.

</line>


<line>
My wife <name type="PERSON">Harriet</name>

always had a sneaker for <name type="PERSON">Ziggy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?

</line>


<line>
Unspoken? It was shouted!

</line>


<line>
Nevertheless, me and <name type="PERSON">Harriet</name> ended up

having a fling.

</line>


<line>
Eventually, we got married.

</line>


<line>
-And that killed the partnership?

-No, we got over that.

</line>


<line>
But at their tenth anniversary,

I had a few too many--

</line>


<line>
And what, you took a swing at him?

</line>


<line>
I said I always felt

he had the easier job,

coming up with the punch lines.

</line>


<line>
And then what? What led to the rift?

</line>


<line>
Led? That's the whole rift!

He besmirched my craft.

</line>


<line>
I still haven't forgiven

the son of a bitch!

</line>


<line>
I said it then, and I stand by it now!

</line>


<line>
All the pressure's on the punch line!

</line>


<line>
Pressure? Please!

</line>


<line>
Set-ups need context,

mise-en-scène, flavor!

</line>


<line>
I carried us to the top

of the <name type="ORG">Popsicle</name> stick game!

</line>


<line>
You wrote the part

they let you try before you buy!

</line>


<line>
I had to deliver the money line!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Ugh!

</line>


<line>
So, you both think you had the harder job?

</line>


<line>
-[Abel] Of course!

-Indubitably!

</line>


<line>
Well, what if you tried switching roles?

</line>


<line>
-You mean, I tag <ital>his </ital>set-ups?

-Why not?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

I'm a punch line guy my whole life.

</line>


<line>
How do I come up with straight lines?

</line>


<line>
-You could try using a ruler.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I missed you, Abel!

-You, too, Zig!

</line>


<line>
All right, so we have a deal?

</line>


<line>
What did the terminally ill man say

to Dr. Kevorkian?

</line>


<line>
"Give me that sweet release!"

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
Did you really mean what you said,

before the screening?

</line>


<line>
About how Philbert made you feel okay,

about yourself?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know--

</line>


<line>
Because, you know,

that's not the point of Philbert--

for guys to watch it and feel okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, it's a compliment.

You did a good job. Relax.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you, or anyone else,

justifying their shitty behavior

because of the show.

</line>


<line>
What is your problem?

</line>


<line>
Why can't you accept

that something you did is successful?

</line>


<line>
It's connecting to people,

and that's good.

</line>


<line>
You're right, sorry.

I don't know why I thought you would care.

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me?

-What is going on with you? You're a mess.

</line>


<line>
-Am I?

-I feel like I barely know you anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.

</line>


<line>
-It's true. I don't know you.

-No. You know me. You do.

</line>


<line>
Then what the hell happened in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
Look, I...

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you think

that you know--

</line>


<line>
I don't know anything!

</line>


<line>
I mean, I know something happened

with a girl in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

and I know it resulted in

you coming home in a boat.

</line>


<line>
-Well, that's--

-I also know...

that your old friend <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>

lives in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>

because you used to leave

her business card lying around the house,

and I know her daughter is a senior

at <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>.

</line>


<line>
-How--?

-And I know you went to <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>

during your bender three years ago

because a bunch of students

posted pictures of you on <name type="ORG">Facebook</name>.

</line>


<line>
Christ,

why are you so obsessed with me?

</line>


<line>
I am not obsessed.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to know what happened,

and you wouldn't tell me.

</line>


<line>
-You never asked!

-Okay, so I'm asking now.

</line>


<line>
What happened in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Hallo! Smile for <name type="ORG">Yahoo</name>, <name type="GPE">Finland</name>!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>


<line>
What I don't understand is why you feel

like you deserve to know

every shitty thing I ever did.

</line>


<line>
I don't deserve anything.

</line>


<line>
I would like to know

when you've done shitty things.

</line>


<line>
Why is that your business?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm your friend,

and I care about you,

and I wrote a book about you,

and now I wrote this show for you,

and I am very publicly your friend,

so if it gets out that you're doing

creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.

</line>


<line>
Oh! So you're worried about things

that I may have done

because you think

that it reflects badly on <ital>you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hurts your brand?

That's your moral high ground?

</line>


<line>
This is not about "moral high ground."

</line>


<line>
Wanna know about <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
You want to know about the one

little thing that I did in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

which, by the way,

wasn't even really a thing?

</line>


<line>
-You know what? Spare me.

-No, I'm gonna tell you.

</line>


<line>
I'll tell you what you want.

</line>


<line>
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about

what happened at the MTV beach house?

</line>


<line>
Or why I'm not allowed

to fly United anymore?

</line>


<line>
Or what happened with <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>,

the makeup lady on <ital>Horsing Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Or the dozens of other shady things

that may or may not have occurred

in my life that I can barely even remember

</line>


<line>
'cause I was high or drunk

or it was 30 years ago?

</line>


<line>
And you don't feel bad,

about any of this stuff?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, of course I do!

I've spent so much time feeling bad.

</line>


<line>
By the way, most of these women...

don't even remember, I bet.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's really convenient for you.

</line>


<line>
I'm the one

who has to live with this shit.

</line>


<line>
I'm the one who has to feel the guilt

all day, every day.

</line>


<line>
So, you're the victim here?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and I know

that's not the woke, progressive,

intersectionally appropriate thing to say,

but I would say, yeah!

</line>


<line>
I'm the one who has suffered the most

because of the actions of <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-You've </ital>suffered?

-Yeah, I have!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-The most?</ital>

<ital>-The most!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Really? More than, say, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Don't talk to me about her.

</line>


<line>
No, I wanna know how <ital>you're </ital>the victim

of the <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> story.

</line>


<line>
-I'm serious.

-Explain to me...

how <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s overdose was

really rough for you.

</line>


<line>
-Shut up.

-You feel a lot of guilt about that?

</line>


<line>
You feel a lot of guilt because you were

the only father figure she ever had,

and when she came to you for help, you--

</line>


<line>
-Hey, how you doing?

-You folks having a good time?

</line>


<line>
You look great. Thanks for coming.

</line>


<line>
-You had sex with her?

-That's-- ! No.

</line>


<line>
And then when she was sober,

you took her on a month-long bender?

</line>


<line>
And then she died. And she is dead now.

And you're still alive.

</line>


<line>
With a girlfriend, who is also alive,

and a TV show.

</line>


<line>
And that's been really hard for <ital>you,</ital>

the main character in this story.

</line>


<line>
Why are you bringing this shit up?

Is this fun for you?

</line>


<line>
-To really rub in--

-It's not <ital>fun.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You win! You scored all the points

in the argument!

</line>


<line>
According to facts, you are right

and I am wrong, like always.

</line>


<line>
But you know what? I don't care.

Because I'm trying to move forward.

</line>


<line>
You haven't changed at all.

</line>


<line>
Yes! Congratulations!

You are the last person to get that.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna <ital>change.</ital>

I don't need your <ital>help for changing,</ital>

so you can stop trying

to make me your project.

</line>


<line>
-That's not--

-When I met you, I was depressed

because I didn't like myself.

</line>


<line>
And when you wrote that book

and sold a bajillion copies,

you taught me that as screwed up

as I am, that's okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You </ital>did that. And now I'm okay.

</line>


<line>
I don't believe that's true.

</line>


<line>
And I don't think you believe it's true.

</line>


<line>
I think you want me to tell you

that you can be better.

</line>


<line>
And even though you're being

a total asshole right now,

</line>


<line>
I still believe it.

</line>


<line>
If all you've gotten

out of this friendship,

is the idea that you should be okay

with yourself, as you are,

then I don't think

this is a good relationship...

for either of us.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, come on.

-I'm going home.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, we're saying things,

but let's just go back to the party.

</line>


<line>
I'm done... with all of this.

</line>


<line>
I went to <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name> to see <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>.

</line>


<line>
She was married with a daughter.

</line>


<line>
But it wasn't like...

what you're thinking.

</line>


<line>
She was 17, which is the legal age

of consent in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

and she wasn't drunk, so,

not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.

</line>


<line>
That's the dumbest part of all of this!

I didn't do anything.

</line>


<line>
I mean, the fact that this has turned

into such a thing for you--

you know, maybe I didn't tell you

because there was nothing to tell.

</line>


<line>
Did you ever think of that?

She was my friend's daughter,

and she wanted it, and I was... [breathes]

</line>


<line>
I was in a bad place

because <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name> had just--

</line>


<line>
So, then she came onto my boat,

<name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>, I mean,

and she walked in,

and I was with her daughter.

</line>


<line>
But again, nothing had happened yet.

</line>


<line>
-"Yet?"

-Nothing happened.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, no!

-Hey-- Aah!

</line>


<line>
You wanted me to tell you. I told you.

You know everything.

</line>


<line>
-Please let go of me.

-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, please.

</line>


<line>
You're hurting me,

and I would like you to let go now.

Well, all ten episodes

</line>

-will be on our website at midnight.

<ital>-More.</ital>

Ooh! <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>! They're picking us up

-You're leaving?

</line>


<line>
I'm just getting some air.

</line>


<line>
No, wrong Prius.

I'm sorry I lost my ticket!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Want me to drive you home?

</line>


<line>
You can come back

and get your car tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
You don't have to do that.

</line>


<line>
Of course not.

I don't have to do anything.

</line>


<line>
-[camera shutters clicking]

-[guests laughing]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I know it's early,

but have you started writing

your acceptance speech for the Emmys?

</line>


<line>
Oh, stop. I'll probably just repurpose

whatever I say at the SAG Awards.

</line>


<line>
-[laughter]

-Is that gonna read as cocky?

</line>


<line>
Can you explain to your readers

that I'm being charmingly self-effacing?

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me.

-Oh, hey, hot stuff! Whoa!

And, great job, by the way.

You're really good on the show.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? No. Me? No. Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! You're a good actor.

I never knew that about you.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll see you back on set, right?

</line>


<line>
Did you hear we got picked up

for more episodes?

</line>


<line>
I'm not going back.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Well, then,

I guess I'll see you around.

</line>


<line>
I hope so. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I can't believe I finally got you

to leave a party early.

</line>


<line>
Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.

</line>


<line>
-Why? I'm such a disaster.

-You're not a disaster.

</line>


<line>
You're <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>. You're amazing.

</line>


<line>
Do you wanna come in?
