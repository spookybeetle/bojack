<line>
<ital>You got to get your shit</ital>

<ital>together.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So you took some licks,

but you're gonna bo<name type="ORG">un</name>ce back,

because you're talented,

you're smart,

and damn it,

you're good.

</line>


<line>
You are a goddamn <name type="GPE">America</name>n

treasure, you know that?

</line>


<line>
You are BoJack goddamn

<name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
So get the hell off my lawn.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Here I thought I was at the

drive-through at Carl's Jr.

</line>


<line>
How much did I have to drink

last night?

</line>


<line>
Last night?

Oh, you've been on a bender

for the last two weeks, ever

since you fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out Diane

got engaged

to Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

</line>


<line>
Diane got engaged

to Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>?

</line>


<line>
- I need a drink.

- No. No more drinking.

</line>


<line>
You've been out of control.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, look.

I met John Stamos.

</line>


<line>
That is not John Stamos.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

</line>


<line>
John Stamos and I

got our ears pierced.

</line>


<line>
That is not your ear.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

John Stamos died.

</line>


<line>
Why?

Why, God?

</line>


<line>
Why did you take John Stamos?

</line>


<line>
That doesn't so<name type="ORG">un</name>d so bad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I forgot to mention you

were naked for a lot of that.

</line>


<line>
Stamos!

</line>


<line>
Also, it wasn't here.

It was at my office.

</line>


<line>
We thought night swimming

would be f<name type="ORG">un</name>,

but the current

was too strong.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God, I wasn't

driving aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d, was I?

</line>


<line>
No. You made Todd

your designated driver,

but then you also made him

drink with you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'll have

a western bacon cheeseburger.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, we are going

to get you back on your feet.

</line>


<line>
All you need to do

is get off Diane

and get on to something else.

</line>


<line>
- [line rings]

<ital>- Hello?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Tony, hi.

I'm calling in that favor.

</line>


<line>
Get your crew

to BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man's house.

</line>


<line>
Can you be there in an hour?

</line>


<line>
<ital>- Yeah.</ital>

- Great.

</line>


<line>
What just happened?

</line>


<line>
You're the new face

of Guten Bourbon.

</line>


<line>
What is Guten Bourbon?

</line>


<line>
It's an urban <name type="NORP">German</name>

bourbon.

</line>


<line>
Am I just h<name type="ORG">un</name>gover, or are

you talking like a <name type="NORP">Muppet</name>?

</line>


<line>
They're looking

for <name type="GPE">America</name>n celebrities

to talk about how much

they like to drink.

</line>


<line>
It's the part

you were born to play.

</line>


<line>
All you have to do is smile

and stay upright.

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

It so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like a lot of work.

</line>


<line>
You take up 80% of my time

with your drama

and make me 0% of my money.

</line>


<line>
Do the damn commercial.

<ital>with Lenny <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, I got to go.

You're in charge, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Keep this dummy

out of trouble.

</line>


<line>
Hooray, responsibility.

</line>


<line>
- [vomits]

- Hey.

</line>


<line>
Do you really believe all that

stuff you said to me earlier

about me being smart

and talented and good?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'm an agent.

I believe everything I say.

</line>


<line>
Ah.

</line>


<line>
Hey, where the hell

is that cheeseburger?

</line>


<line>
I ordered it,

like, an hour ago.

Lenny <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub,

you skinny bitch.

</line>


<line>
How the hell are you?

</line>


<line>
I'm in a hurry,

so I'll make this... snappy.

</line>


<line>
I got some great news about

the picture

</line>


<line>
we're putting together.

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone rings]

- Sorry. Hello?

</line>


<line>
Hey, I just wanted to thank

you for getting me this job

</line>


<line>
and pulling me out of that

oh-so-predictably BoJack

</line>


<line>
spiral of self-loathing

and substance abuse.

</line>


<line>
- You really are the best.

- I know. Talk to you later.

</line>


<line>
I feel like you see things

in me that nobody else sees.

</line>


<line>
Yep, I'm pretty great.

Got to go.

</line>


<line>
All this time,

I never even--

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'm in a very

important breakfast right now.

</line>


<line>
- Okay. I got to go, too.

- Sorry.

</line>


<line>
What's the great news?

</line>


<line>
- We got <name type="ORG">Braff</name>.

- You beautiful dickhead.

</line>


<line>
You finally got Zach <name type="ORG">Braff</name>?

</line>


<line>
Ah, no other director

has enough weight

</line>


<line>
to handle a movie about

the last days of Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
No shit, toots.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

There you go.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
Everything's coming

together.

</line>


<line>
With <name type="ORG">Braff</name> directing,

</line>


<line>
my client <name type="ORG">Cate</name> Blanchett

starring,

</line>


<line>
and the great

Lenny <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub producing,

this movie is a done deal.

</line>


<line>
Look, honey, I been in this

business a long time, okay?

</line>


<line>
Long time.

</line>


<line>
And as I once said

to a yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g Ed Begley Sr.,

</line>


<line>
"It ain't a done deal

till the deals are all done."

</line>


<line>
I'm the best agent

in the biz.

</line>


<line>
I can seal these deals

with my paws in my pants.

</line>


<line>
Well, then I'll say to you

what I once said

to a yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g Buster Keaton,

"What?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[jazzy music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[overlapping shouting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Laura!

What's happening?

</line>


<line>
- We're merging.

- No shit. With what?

</line>


<line>
FME. A b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of people

got laid off,

and some of the FMEers

are already moving in.

</line>


<line>
It's all so sudden

and <name type="ORG">un</name>expected.

</line>


<line>
- It was not handled well.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit. Don't tell me

one of the new agents is...

</line>


<line>
Vanessa Gekko.

</line>


<line>
That slippery, slimy,

cold-blooded, bug-eyed--

</line>


<line>
What's new, pussycat?

</line>


<line>
- Gekko.

- In the flesh.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha. How are you?

</line>


<line>
What a morning, huh?

</line>


<line>
I was in the middle

of my <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond soul cycle class

when I got the news.

</line>


<line>
- Can you imagine?

- No.

</line>


<line>
I was so excited,

I rushed home,

made love

to my husband of 15 years,

made a hot breakfast

for my three wonderful girls,

read to them, dropped them off

at their elite private school,

and then got my ass here

as quick as I could.

</line>


<line>
- Um, how old are your kids now?

- I don't have any children.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, it'll happen.

You're still...

</line>


<line>
- Anyway--

- Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
I see you've already met

a new member of the team.

</line>


<line>
- Vanessa Gekko, sir.

- I know that.

</line>


<line>
This merger is very exciting.

</line>


<line>
- I'm pumped.

- I'm beyond pumped.

</line>


<line>
You should be, or at least

I think you should be.

</line>


<line>
It's hard to keep track

of who's getting promoted

</line>


<line>
- and who's getting fired.

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
You're probably fine or not.

Who knows?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

What do you want, Todd?

</line>


<line>
Well, good news, bad news.

</line>


<line>
The bad news is that there

actually is no good news,

and the other bad news

is BoJack's gone.

</line>


<line>
What? Where did he go?

The shoot is at his house.

</line>


<line>
He just disappeared. I don't

even know why he'd leave.

</line>


<line>
This charcoal mellowed bourbon

is so smooth,

every time I take a sip,

pure happiness.

</line>


<line>
- That was amazing.

- Really?

</line>


<line>
Can I get you to say that

in a tuxedo?

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got to go.

I think this is my big break.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. I won't let it

get to my head or anything.

</line>


<line>
Hey, who told that asshole

he could sit in my chair?

</line>


<line>
Don't forget I'm your agent, too!

I want 10%.

</line>


<line>
Hello, beautiful.

</line>


<line>
What the hell

are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
You're supposed to be

shooting a commercial.

</line>


<line>
I know, but I was sitting

there drinking bourbon and--

</line>


<line>
They didn't give you

fake bourbon on set?

</line>


<line>
Oh, they did, and then

I just mixed it with bourbon.

</line>


<line>
And it hit me.

</line>


<line>
Why was I so upset

about Diane getting engaged?

</line>


<line>
You're the one who's always

been there for me,

so I drank a lot more bourbon

and drove over to tell you

how I feel.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I see what this is.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>


<line>
Clearly we're in love

with each other.

</line>


<line>
You're not in love with me.

You're in love with Diane.

</line>


<line>
And you're not even

really in love with her.

</line>


<line>
You just think you are

because you pay her

to listen to you

talk about yourself.

</line>


<line>
Diane getting engaged

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
It made me realize you're

the one I need to be with.

</line>


<line>
Ha! You say that every time

something bad happens.

</line>


<line>
Not getting nominated

for <name type="ORG">a People's Choice Award</name>

is the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
It made me realize--

</line>


<line>
Getting caught

with that po<name type="ORG">un</name>d of cocaine

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
That hooker getting pregnant

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei

was the best--

</line>


<line>
Every time

something bad happens,

you come r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning to me

for comfort.

</line>


<line>
Well, it's not gonna happen

this time.

</line>


<line>
I can't be your agent

and your girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
- It just doesn't work.

- [knock on door]

</line>


<line>
I have Lenny <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub

for you.

</line>


<line>
- I have to take this.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
But remember,

I'm coming for you,

and I'm gonna make you love me.

</line>


<line>
Please don't.

Hey.

</line>


<line>
Bad news, P.C.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Braff</name> used your merger as

an opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity to jump ship.

</line>


<line>
Aw, fish.

</line>


<line>
Now his new agent's

asking for twice the money.

</line>


<line>
As I once said

to a yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g Lionel Barrymore,

</line>


<line>
"Eh, shut up."

</line>


<line>
Without a director, <ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital>

is as dead as Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yep.

You got to get someone big.

</line>


<line>
- <ital>What about those brothers</ital>--

- Hello? Hello?

</line>


<line>
Lady, you work too hard.

</line>


<line>
That was

an important phone call.

</line>


<line>
Important phone call

beep boop blorp.

</line>


<line>
Don't you robot-voice me.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm working,

and you are leaving.

</line>


<line>
Before I go, I got you

a little sexy something

to remember me by.

</line>


<line>
Since we can't be together

every <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond,

which would be my preference,

I give you cardboard BoJack.

</line>


<line>
It's got

a light-sensitive so<name type="ORG">un</name>d chip,

so every time you walk by it,

it quotes a line

from <ital>Jerry Maguire</ital>,

your favorite movie.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You complete me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
What do you think?

Pretty sweet, huh?

</line>


<line>
<ital>You had me at "hello."</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't have time for you

or cardboard you.

</line>


<line>
I need to find

a new director.

</line>


<line>
Or you could find

my nude erector--

</line>


<line>
She's gone.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[jazzy music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[elevator bell dings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Blech.

Word to the wise, Laura--

</line>


<line>
Do not pitch a <name type="NORP">Nazi</name> romance

to Steven Spielberg.

</line>


<line>
Just thought you should know

there's been some

reorganization

</line>


<line>
- vis-a-vis resource management.

- What are you saying?

</line>


<line>
You and Vanessa Gekko

are sharing an office

<name type="ORG">un</name>til they can find her

a permanent one.

</line>


<line>
- The hell we are.

- Also...

</line>


<line>
Good news, Princess Carolyn.

Vanessa's my agent now.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
You said you couldn't be

my girlfriend and my agent,

so I'm firing you.

</line>


<line>
Now we can be in love.

</line>


<line>
- Hope you like money, BoJack.

- This is so great.

</line>


<line>
Now I can date you

and have a better agent.

</line>


<line>
- Everybody wins.

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm a sporting agent.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you still

searching for happiness?

</line>


<line>
Make your own happiness.

</line>


<line>
Mmm, that's some Guten

Bourbon.

</line>


<line>
Cut.

That was great.

</line>


<line>
Was it? You know, I'm trying

to do good work here,

really find the character,

but it's pretty distracting

to have all these robots

staring at me

with their blinking red eyes.

</line>


<line>
Those are cameras, Todd.

We're making a commercial.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well,

you want to make a good one?

</line>


<line>
Then get them

the hell out of here!

</line>


<line>
I'm the face of this brand,

I'm the man behind the thing,

and I'm determined

to get the jargon

of this <name type="NORP">German</name> bourbon blurbin'.

</line>


<line>
Is it just me,

or does this fake booze

taste a lot like real booze?

</line>


<line>
You want BoJack,

you can have him.

</line>


<line>
Here's a list of directors

who won't work with him,

studios that won't hire him,

former assistants

with restraining orders.

</line>


<line>
This is great.

</line>


<line>
You know,

it gets kind of boring

when all your clients

are in such <name type="NORP">dem</name>and,

they practically

find their own jobs.

</line>


<line>
Well, then BoJack should be

a lot of f<name type="ORG">un</name> for you.

</line>


<line>
- No one wants to hire him.

- [knock on door]

</line>


<line>
Hello. We're looking

for BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man's agent.

</line>


<line>
We'd like to discuss

a very lucrative business

opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity.

</line>


<line>
- You gotta be kidding me.

- I'm BoJack's agent.

</line>


<line>
The opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity

is we're blackmailing you.

</line>


<line>
Ha. All yours.

</line>


<line>
Needless to say,

it would be a shame

if these pictures got out.

</line>


<line>
Fort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately, that can

easily be avoided

by simply paying me

and my partner here $150.

</line>


<line>
Each.

</line>


<line>
Let me just get my

checkbook.

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
- Whoa.

- [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, except <name type="GPE">California</name> law

prohibits taking photos

on private property

without a permit,

but you had a permit, right?

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- What's that?

</line>


<line>
Oh, also, extortion can be

pro<name type="ORG">sec</name>uted

as a class E felony.

</line>


<line>
That's four years

in prison, easy,

and when you throw in

the murder of Tupac Shakur...

</line>


<line>
- We didn't do that.

- Yeah, yeah.

</line>


<line>
You can't pin that on us.

</line>


<line>
Well, someone's got

to take the fall.

</line>


<line>
- [both gulp]

- Sorry to bother you.

</line>


<line>
Forget we were ever here.

</line>


<line>
That was f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Laura, send those guys

a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

</line>


<line>
You got it, boss.

</line>


<line>
Who said you could use

my assistant?

</line>


<line>
- I did.

- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Did you know the human head</ital>

<ital>weighs 8 po<name type="ORG">un</name>ds?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Fascinating.

</line>


<line>
So sorry we have

to double up on everything

while we work out who goes

where and who gets fired,

but in the meantime,

help yourself to an intern,

one of the rising stars

at our company--

</line>


<line>
- Charlie Witherspoon.

- Hello. I-- Oh.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, my-- My hands

are really sticky.

<nonVerbComm>[phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.

<name type="ORG">Pho</name>ne is ringing.

<line>
What do I do?

What do I do?

</line>


<line>
I'll take it in here,

Charlie. Hello.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

your client is out of control.

</line>


<line>
BoJack is not

my client anymore.

</line>


<line>
Not BoJack.

Todd.

</line>


<line>
I think someone mixed alcohol

into his prop drink.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you pretenders.

</line>


<line>
Bourbon is the name

of a co<name type="ORG">un</name>ty.

</line>


<line>
You can't just make bourbon

in <name type="NORP">German</name>y.

</line>


<line>
That would be like

making Rice-A-Roni

</line>


<line>
- anywhere but <name type="GPE">San Francisco</name>.

- No, no, no, no, no.

</line>


<line>
- Ugh. I'll be right there.

- Ow.

</line>


<line>
You got to get

your shit together.

</line>


<line>
You are a winner, okay?

You are <name type="GPE">Todd--</name> Hold on.

</line>


<line>
<ital>4:30 p.m.</ital>

<ital>Meeting with Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name> team.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Fish.

Okay, you are Todd goddamn--

</line>


<line>
- What's your last name?

- Chavez.

</line>


<line>
- Your last name is Chavez?

- Yeah. Why?

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

I just never thought of you

as a Chavez.

Look, I got to go.

</line>


<line>
I feel like you didn't

really finish the pep talk.

</line>


<line>
I know, but I got a movie

to put together.

</line>


<line>
Best of luck.

</line>


<line>
Ready for the tagline?

Here's the tagline.

</line>


<line>
What the heck is going on?

</line>


<line>
"The woman who loved the man

who hated everyone."

</line>


<line>
- That writes itself.

- You got to be kidding me.

</line>


<line>
Hey, where were you?

We looked everywhere.

</line>


<line>
You're having the <ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital>

meeting without me?

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry,

but I didn't know what

the protocol was aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d here,

and these guys were just

champing at the bit.

</line>


<line>
- We're just wrapping up.

- But <name type="ORG">Cate</name> is my client.

</line>


<line>
Okay, why don't I come

find you when it's over,

and I'll bring you up to speed?

</line>


<line>
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

I brought him on board.

</line>


<line>
You know he's always wanted

to direct a romantic comedy?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital>

is not a romantic comedy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sing-song]</nonVerbComm> Bye.

<ital>We live in a cynical world,</ital>

<ital>a cynical world.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He's right, you know.

</line>


<line>
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate.

Hey.

</line>


<line>
I just missed

an important meeting

because I was babysitting

Todd, who's too dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k to work,

because you switched out

the prop bourbon

with the real bourbon.

You are ruining my life.

</line>


<line>
- Have dinner with me tonight.

- No way.

</line>


<line>
Come on, just me, you,

and a bottle of <name type="LOC">Pinot</name>.

</line>


<line>
Probably more than one bottle

and some entrees.

</line>


<line>
And I'll probably get

an appetizer.

</line>


<line>
I own the restaurant,

so we can go crazy.

</line>


<line>
- I have to work.

- You don't have to work.

</line>


<line>
- You choose to work.

- Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Why not choose to be happy

for once?

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>

<line>
When you're writing a memoir,

you spend a lot of time

reflecting on the past.

</line>


<line>
I regret not being

a better friend to you

and lover.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Lover's kind of a weird word,

but thanks.

</line>


<line>
You want to get out

of this stuffy old restaurant,

get some gelato, and maybe

drive out to the ocean

</line>


<line>
- and put our feet in the water?

- That so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great.

</line>


<line>
Let me just freshen up

my whiskers.

</line>


<line>
Great. I'll get the car

and meet you outside.

</line>


<line>
You scamper right back,

pussycat.

</line>


<line>
You look at your reflection

too long,

you might fall in love.

She's gone.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What do you want, Gekko?

</line>


<line>
Well, I was hoping

to talk to you face-to-face,

but I guess you had

to leave work early.

</line>


<line>
I left at 8:30.

What is it?

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="ORG">Cate</name> and I

had a really good talk today.

</line>


<line>
<ital>We have so much in common,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and especially since I'm doing</ital>

<ital>so much for Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>it almost seemed weird</ital>

<ital>that I wasn't repping her.</ital>

</line>


<line>
No. No. No, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

</line>


<line>
She and I are both

high-powered working mothers,

so I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand her

priorities,

so she's switching to Gekko.

</line>


<line>
Wow, being a mom

helped my career?

</line>


<line>
I really can have it all.

</line>


<line>
This isn't fair.

I know everything about <name type="ORG">Cate</name>.

</line>


<line>
Her favorite color is red.

</line>


<line>
Her favorite book

is <ital><name type="LOC">Suffragette City</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

</line>


<line>
I know all I need to know,

which is that she's beautiful,

she's <name type="NORP">British</name>,

and she's gonna make me

a lot of money.

</line>


<line>
She's <name type="NORP">Australian</name>, you moron.

</line>


<line>
If you need me,

I'll be at work.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sing-song]</nonVerbComm> Bye.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sing-song]</nonVerbComm> Bye.

</line>


<line>

Uh, uh, sorry, I can't--

</line>


<line>
Oh, sticky.

</line>


<line>
You know what?

Never mind.

</line>


<line>
If Vanessa Gekko wants <name type="ORG">Cate</name>

that bad, she can have her.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna be okay.

I'm gonna be happy.

</line>


<line>
Tonight, I choose to be happy.

</line>


<line>
Hello? I think

I put you on mute.

</line>


<line>
Good night, Charlie.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringtone jingles]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>I'll be alive tomorrow.</ital>

<ital>After that, who knows?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeps off]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Sorry that took me so long.

</line>


<line>
Just wanted to look my best

for you, lover.

</line>


<line>
Hey, um, I just got kind of

a weird phone call.

</line>


<line>
You and me both.

Hey, screw 'em all, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Are we going to gelato?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>


<line>
Getting gelato?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
This was a mistake.

I've been acting crazy.

</line>


<line>
That phone call just

pulled me back to reality.

</line>


<line>
You were right.

I don't love you.

</line>


<line>
You don't love me.

We're just two lonely people

trying to hate ourselves

a little less.

</line>


<line>
Maybe that's all

we're ever gonna be.

</line>


<line>
Maybe that's all we ever were.

</line>


<line>
Well, this night took

a turn.

</line>


<line>
You know the worst part?

I knew this was gonna happen

and I let myself

get excited anyway.

</line>


<line>
So we agree that this is

on you, then?

</line>


<line>
I guess I'll see you aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
You're not even

gonna give me a ride home?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I think I just

need to be alone right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[tires squealing]</nonVerbComm>

<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Of course, of course.

That's what you get

when you fall for a horse.

</line>

Taxi.

</line>


<line>
You got to get your shit

together.

</line>


<line>
So yesterday, you let yourself

fall in love a little bit,

and you got your heart broken.

</line>


<line>
Serves you right

for having feelings.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Starting now, you are</ital>

<ital>a hard, heartless career gal.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Go to work, be awesome at it,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and don't waste time</ital>

<ital>on foolish flights of fancy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>From now on, you are a robot.</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hello.

- I just want you to know I'm fine.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. People only say they're fine

when they're not fine.

</line>


<line>
Did I hurt your feelings

last night?

</line>


<line>
I'm an agent.

I don't have feelings.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm glad you called.

</line>


<line>
I think that you had

the right idea yesterday.

</line>


<line>
I should be

getting back to work.

</line>


<line>
Can you get me another job?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, I'm not

your agent anymore, so, no.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. Well, just tell

whoever, then.

</line>


<line>
- Haah!

- [tires screech]

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[honks horn]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Asshole!

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm off to <name type="GPE">Malibu</name>

to see Herb Kazzaz.

</line>


<line>
He has cancer, which,

as you know, is a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
Plus, he hates me, so I could

really use some good news

at the end of the day.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God,

you're going to see Herb?

</line>


<line>
You must be really--

</line>


<line>
Nope, don't care.

Not interested.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hope you like kicking ass,

Charlie,

because that's all

we're gonna do today.

</line>


<line>
My tie got stuck in the

copier this morning.

</line>


<line>
That's great, Charlie.

</line>


<line>
If you flip them real quick,

it looks like

the tie is r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Vanessa, your client,

BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man, wants a job.

</line>


<line>
- Good luck.

- Oh, yeah, about that.

</line>


<line>
Gwyneth came in this morning,

and I wanted to show her

that she was a top priority,

so I shredded BoJack's

contract

right in front of her.

Heh heh

</line>


<line>
What? You just signed BoJack

yesterday.

</line>


<line>
I say good riddance

to Mr. <name type="ORG">House</name>man

or whatever

that horse's name is.

</line>


<line>
It's not like he makes

this company any money,

and he does seem to take up

an awful lot of your time.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm from <name type="GPE">Arizona</name>, Jerry.</ital>

<ital>I went to <name type="GPE">Arizona</name> State.</ital>

<line>
<ital>[Todd] What? I'm busy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>[BoJack] Never mind.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now that I've got the room</ital>

<ital>to myself,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>time to practice the trombone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>[trombone plays]</ital>

</line>


<line>
He's kind of in

a bad place right now.

</line>


<line>
You can't just drop him.

</line>


<line>
The best agent

in this building

couldn't get that guy a job.

</line>


<line>
The best agent

in this building

got him a job yesterday,

and I could get him a feature

by the end of today.

</line>


<line>
If you want to get him

a movie

by the end of the day,

great, do that.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise, we are washing

our hands of him.

</line>


<line>
Charlie, I hear <name type="ORG">NBC</name> picked up

your r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning tie show.

</line>


<line>
Congratulations.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Charlie]</nonVerbComm> Thank you, Dad.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Marty,

Princess Carolyn here.

</line>


<line>
How'd you like to work with

the BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

</line>


<line>
What's that?

You hate his guts?

</line>


<line>
What's that?

He's a talentless boob?

</line>


<line>
What's that? You'll never

work with BoJack again?

</line>


<line>
What's that?

</line>


<line>
You want him to die in

an ass factory warehouse fire,

smothering to death

<name type="ORG">un</name>der a pile of burning asses?

</line>


<line>
Well, if you change your mind,

give me a call.

</line>


<line>
Oh, BoJack, what am I

gonna do with you?

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why you're going through

all this trouble for him.

</line>


<line>
That guy's dead weight,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
If you don't cut him loose,

you're never gonna be happy.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Help me help you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That's it.

Of course.

</line>


<line>
Cameron Crow,

you skinny bitch.

</line>


<line>
You know <ital>Jerry Maguire</ital>'s

my favorite movie of all time?

</line>


<line>
All your films are so human,

which is super impressive

since you're a crow.

</line>


<line>
Well, my name is

Cameron Crow,

but I'm actually a raven,

so common misconception.

</line>


<line>
- Well, whatever you are--

- A raven.

</line>


<line>
- I brought you this

- <ital><name type="LOC">Suffragette City</name></ital>...

</line>


<line>
"a coming of age story

about rock music,

being a teenager in the '80s

and buying zoos"?

</line>


<line>
How have I not

heard of this book?

</line>


<line>
You'd be the perfect

director

to make a movie out of it,

and I happen to know this is

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cate</name> Blanchett's

favorite book.

</line>


<line>
I'll bet she'll drop

everything to play the part.

</line>


<line>
You should give her a caw.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I see-- Yeah.

Caw is what crows say.

</line>


<line>
Again, I am not a crow.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[jazzy music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cate</name>, listen to me,

you're making a big mistake.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital>

is your dream, remember?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cate</name>? Hello?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cate</name>!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. What happened?

</line>


<line>
Did <name type="ORG">Cate</name> drop out of

your little Holocaust movie

so she could make

my little Cameron Crow movie?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you go home

and cry about it

to your loving husband

and children?

</line>


<line>
Say, which one of you

is overseeing

the <ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital> package?

</line>


<line>
That would be me, sir.

</line>


<line>
Vanessa, you really

shat the bed on this one.

</line>


<line>
Now, are you fired?

Not exactly.

</line>


<line>
Can you still work here? No.

</line>


<line>
Lenny <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub

here to see you.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, Laura.

</line>


<line>
So, one minute I'm making

a movie with <name type="ORG">Cate</name> Blanchett.

</line>


<line>
Next, I hear she's doing

a picture with Cameron Crow

about mix tapes.

</line>


<line>
As I said to Ed Porter

at the premiere of

<ital>The Great Train Robbery</ital>,

</line>


<line>
"Aah, the train's

coming right at me."

</line>


<line>
- What the hell is going on?

- I don't know, Lenny.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name></ital>

was Vanessa's project.

</line>


<line>
All that work for nothing.

</line>


<line>
Now Quentin Tarantulino's

got four arms up my ass

</line>


<line>
'cause he got all excited

about making a rom-com.

</line>


<line>
You know what would be

a great romantic comedy?

</line>


<line>
Remember when that guy stole

the D from the <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name>d sign

so he could propose

to his girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
That would make

a great movie,

but who would play the lead?

</line>


<line>
Preferably someone

kind of washed up.

</line>


<line>
You know how much Quentin

loves to revitalize

dead careers.

</line>


<line>
It's kind of his thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, in that case,

you know who'd be great?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Show me the money.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Yeah.

- Good news.

</line>


<line>
You're back in my stable,

and I got you the lead

in a romantic comedy.

</line>


<line>
Who's the best agent

in the world?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I went through hell and back

today, but it was worth it

because I got you a job.

Aren't you excited?

</line>


<line>
No. I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I don't care about that.

</line>


<line>
You... You said

you wanted a job.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter.

Nothing matters.

</line>


<line>
- <ital>Wow. What happened in <name type="GPE">Malibu</name>?</ital>

- I got to go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beep]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Need anything else?

</line>


<line>
No, thanks, Laura. Go home.
