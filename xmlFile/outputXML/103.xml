<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur family will never

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he most important thing is,

you got to give the people

what they want,

even if it kills you,

even if it empties you out <name type="ORG">un</name>til

there's nothing left to empty.

</line>


<line>
No matter what happens,

no matter <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much it hurts,

you don't stop dancing,

and you give t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se people

what they want.

I'm a grown up, sophisticated

People like sex, okay,

Are you at all worried

It's a really big deal.

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I actually wanted

to talk to you about that.

</line>


<line>
When we started dating,

you were the biggest star

in the world,

but your last few albums tanked,

so now, I don't even know

what you are anymore.

Are you-- Are you breaking up

Oh, bother.

Because you know

I'll bleed for you.

Darling, please, I wanted

to do this in a public place

so you wouldn't make a scene.

a scene, you limey bastard?

on a sofa

<line>
Where's <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> now?

</line>


<line>
I checked her into Promises.

28 days, she'll be good as new.

</line>


<line>
How did it feel

to check the girl

you raised on television

into rehab?

</line>


<line>
It was tough.

</line>


<line>
I would have liked

to reconnect with her.

</line>


<line>
At least we got to bond a little

on the drive to <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>libu.

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, huh?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe the two of you

can catch up some more

when she gets out of rehab.

</line>


<line>
People don't usually want to

hang out with me after rehab.

</line>


<line>
I'm really more

of a before-rehab friend.

<line>

Uh, s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld you be taking

Hi, what it is,

<line>
I'm not looking

</line>


<line>
Oh, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> says

I'm looking for a new client?

</line>


<line>
Slow your roll,

Speed Racer.

</line>


<line>
We're just two single ladies

having a no-presh rap sesh.

</line>


<line>
I'm not one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se agents

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can't turn it off.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur <name type="PERSON">Ari Emanuels</name> and <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name>

Geckos and what have you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko is actually

<name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>'s agent,

and she's really great.

</line>


<line>
Is she?

I've heard that.

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize you were

so into <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use music.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I asked her

to turn it down, but apparently,

this volume was prescribed

by Dr. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>

to treat something called

"uptight dickhead disease."

</line>


<line>
What do you-- What do you think

about <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't really think

about her all that much.

</line>


<line>
I mean, obviously,

I'm a fan of her early work

which both satirized

and celebrated

youth culture's obsession

with sex,

but I do wonder

as a third-wave feminist

if it's even possible for women

to reclaim their sexuality

in this deeply entrenched

patriarchal society,

or if claiming to do so

is just a lie we tell ourselves

so we can more comfortably cater

to the male <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ze.

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what?

- But you know,

on the other hand, I worry

that conversations like this one

often dismiss her as a mere

puppet of the industry...

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's my same worry.

- ...incapable of en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ging

</line>


<line>
- in these discussions herself...

- Obviously.

</line>


<line>
...and infantilization,

which is itself a product

</line>


<line>
- of the deeply misogynistic...

- So deep.

</line>


<line>
...society we live in.

But like I said,

</line>


<line>
I don't really think about her

all that much.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well,

that is very interesting,

but I was more asking,

like, what do you think

about her living here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, what was

your relationship like

with her when you were working

on the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

</line>


<line>
It was very good,

very professional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

where did you go to college?

</line>


<line>
- Don't bother him, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ney.

- Oh, it's no problem.

</line>


<line>
Honey, college is for

ugly people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can't tap dance.

so that you could be

an architect.

</line>


<line>
- Aw.

- All right,

</line>


<line>
- take it sleazy, everybody.

- Wait, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

um, what are you doing

this weekend?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

I'll probably just go

to the amusement park,

maybe the circus,

fly a kite on the beach,

watch the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>set,

then I'll head

back to my place

to watch any number

Can I come?

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Yeah,

See you <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nday!

</line>


<line>
So the makeup

they were putting on you

was not for the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

it was just for the weekend?

</line>


<line>
Why does that matter?

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying

to <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand the story.

</line>


<line>
Do you think it's possible

that you inviting <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

into your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use now is your way

of compensating for not--

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

I'm just helping out a friend.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying to play out

some weird, sick dad fantasy,

or resolve a deep guilt

for past neglect,

or even try to retroactively fix

my own child<name type="PERSON">ho</name>od

by recreating someone else's,

and I'm especially not doing

all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se things at once!

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d somebody hurt

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>! Ah!

What the--?

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I told my friends they could

tear this wall out to build

a sweet cocaine booth/sex

closet.

</line>


<line>
- Is that cool?

- No, that's not cool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>. Way to harsh the vibe,

<name type="PERSON">Kissinger</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't realize.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught this was a place

where <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

could finally be <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

but I guess...

that's too much, man.

</line>


<line>
I always loved

that catch phrase.

</line>


<line>
Can your friends at least take

the artwork off the wall first?

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

I want to say yes, but no.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, good talk.

- Wha-- Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he reason I have called

this <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use meeting is--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w many times

have we been over this?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have the aut<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rity

to call <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use meetings.

</line>


<line>
Only I can call a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use meeting.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can propose a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use meeting.

</line>


<line>
All right, fine, fine, fine,

but the reason I propose

</line>


<line>
- this <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use meeting--

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur proposal has been

submitted and

is <name type="ORG">un</name>der board review.

</line>


<line>
- Proposal denied.

- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, this <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> thing

is getting out of control, okay?

She's taking advantage of you.

</line>


<line>
What? No she's not.

We have a special relationship.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u couldn't possibly

<name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at what

she's done to your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
All right, look, I mean,

I stepped on a needle earlier.

</line>


<line>
I think I'm addicted

to heroin now,

so now, that's probably

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing.

</line>


<line>
I have to say,

I agree with <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not this girl's father,

and you're not doing her

any favors by refusing

to set bo<name type="ORG">un</name>daries.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I played a dad

for nine years on <name type="PERSON">T</name>V,

so I think I know a little bit

more about parenting

than you two jokers.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he kids on <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his place isn't good

for you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to go where you can

get help, real help.

</line>


<line>
But I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were always

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be there for me

like you said.

</line>


<line>
I will always

be there for you.

</line>


<line>
Cut, let's take ten.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's ten, everyone.

Let's make it a tight ten.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hese pages are shit.

- [coughs]

you <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand?

Shit.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't wipe my ass

with these pages.

</line>


<line>
It would defeat the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

purpose of wiping my ass.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne for you.

- Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u get me points

on the back end?

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- Well, I told you

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do it

<name type="ORG">un</name>less I get points.

</line>


<line>
Oh, they can't find any?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe they could

suck some out of my dick!

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- I'm on the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're being very rude.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u promised me you would

always be there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

this is for your own good.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't stay here anymore.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Okie-doke</name>.

I guess I'll just move out

and find

one of the billion people

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> will let me party

at their <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Uh, well,

you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld not do that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know. I know,

but I can, so I will.

</line>


<line>
I'm at a place right now

where I never need

to grow as a person

or rise to an occasion

because I can constantly

just surro<name type="ORG">un</name>d myself

with sycophants and enablers

<name type="ORG">un</name>til I die tragically yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g.

</line>


<line>
- Wh-What?

- Yeah,

it's pretty much

too late for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, them's the breaks.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake it sleazy, everybody.

</line>


<line>
Oh, by the way,

I called <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko,

and I'm meeting with her

tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for the suggestion.

- No! No, no, no, no, no!

</line>


<line>
Hey, you guys want to hear

my new catchphrase?

</line>


<line>
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[blows raspberry]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Laura</name>, the du<name type="PERSON">mm</name>y took the bait.

Now for phase two.

</line>


<line>
Is she gone?

Is it safe to come out?

</line>


<line>
Leak to the trades

that <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> <name type="PERSON">Garfield</name>'s agent

is taking meetings with his ex,

get it all over town,

wait an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur,

then get me l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch with <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>

on the books for this weekend,

someplace <name type="NORP">Italian</name>.

</line>


<line>
I really blew it,

didn't I?

</line>


<line>
I mean, maybe you could

have been a better role model

when she was yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g, but also,

she never really had a chance.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is what our celebrity

culture does to people.

</line>


<line>
So what you're saying is,

Everything is society's fault,

and we as individuals

never need

to take responsibility

for anything?

</line>


<line>
Uh, no. Not exactly.

I was just saying that--

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I like that.

I didn't do anything wrong

because I can't do

anything wrong

because we're all just products

of our environment,

bo<name type="ORG">un</name>cing aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d like marbles

in the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me

of <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>ngry <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>ngry Hippos

that is our random

and cruel <name type="ORG">un</name>iverse.

</line>


<line>
Wait, no, that's not even

what I'm saying--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, It's not my fault.

It's society.

</line>


<line>
Everything is

because of society!

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, that--

- Dude, just let him have this.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>!

Everything is meaningless!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Nothing I do</ital>

<ital>has consequence!</ital>

</line>


<line>
So what'd you get,

anything good?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I got everything.
