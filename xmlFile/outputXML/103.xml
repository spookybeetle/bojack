<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants

chocolate chip pancakes?

</line>


<line>
I do! I do!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>, didn't you already eat

your pancakes?

</line>


<line>
As Oliver North would say,

"I do not recall."

<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, where's <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>?

</line>


<line>
Not hiding under the table,

that's for sure.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience]</nonVerbComm> Aww...

</line>


<line>
Why don't you guys

leave this one to me?

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you dressed

for school, prickly muffin?

</line>


<line>
I'm scared.

<name type="PERSON">Olivia</name> told me

sometimes, at school

they have pop quizzes.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to pop!

</line>


<line>
That's too much, man.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter and applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>,

nobody's popping on my watch.

</line>


<line>
You stick with me,

and I promise you,

everything's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

just fine.

</line>


<line>
- Cut, boom in the shot.

- What? I'll be in my trailer.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter and applause]</nonVerbComm>

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
You folks enjoying the show?

[crowd cheering]

</line>


<line>
And how about Sara <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

as <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>? Isn't she wonderful?

</line>


<line>
- [cheers and applause]

- Oh. [chuckles] Thank you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

You remember that name.

</line>


<line>
Back to one, everybody.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, you see those people?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, those boobs

and jerk wads

are the best friends

you'll ever have.

</line>


<line>
Without them, you're nothing.

Remember that.

</line>


<line>
Let's take it back

to "prickly muffin."

</line>


<line>
Your family will never

understand you,

your lovers will leave you

or try to change you,

but your fans,

you be good to them,

and they'll be good to you.

</line>


<line>
We are rolling.

Sound speed.

</line>


<line>
The most important thing is,

you got to give the people

what they want,

even if it kills you,

even if it empties you out until

there's nothing left to empty.

</line>


<line>
No matter what happens,

no matter how much it hurts,

you don't stop dancing,

and you don't stop smiling,

and you give those people

what they want.

</line>


<line>
And action.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you dressed

for school, prickly muffin?

</line>


<line>
You might remember her

as adorable <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name>

</line>


<line>
from <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around</ital>,

but on her new dance pop album,

</line>


<line>

that she is hot to trot.

<line>
I'm a grown up, sophisticated

woman now, and I have sex,

and I do sexy things.

</line>


<line>
People like sex, okay,

and since I'm sexy right now,

they like me.

</line>


<line>
Are you at all worried

that audiences will grow bored

and abandon you

for the next sexy thing?

<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Are you kidding?

Pop star and child actress,

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

</line>

celebrates her 30th birthday

this month,

</line>


<line>
raising the question,

"does anyone care

about <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> anymore?"

After all, she is 30.

<name type="ORG">Sextina</name>,

what's your take?

<line>
I love <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

I grew up on her music, okay,

and she's, like, an inspiration,

but now, she is old,

and shriveled, and gross, and

nobody want her no more, okay?

</line>


<line>
They want <name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name>,

baby!

</line>


<line>
Ha ha!

You're delightful.

</line>


<line>
So where does <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

go from here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know where

she should go?

She should go

<nonVerbComm>[screams]</nonVerbComm>

Huh? What the--?

And what's your name,

I-- mm--

I'll just make it out

Uh--

</line>


<line>
Um, hi.

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, hi.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>? Hey. <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>,

this is <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, my TV dad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello,

I'm <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> Garfield.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>'s my boyfriend.

We're a celebrity power couple.

</line>


<line>
It's no big deal.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whispering]</nonVerbComm>

It's a really big deal.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I actually wanted

to talk to you about that.

</line>


<line>
When we started dating,

you were the biggest star

in the world,

but your last few albums tanked,

so now, I don't even know

what you are anymore.

</line>


<line>
Are you-- Are you breaking up

with me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, bother.

</line>


<line>
Um, are those candy pills,

</line>


<line>
'cause if so,

that is a lot of sugar.

</line>


<line>
Why are you doing this to me?

</line>


<line>
Do you like seeing me suffer?

</line>


<line>
Because you know

I'll bleed for you.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

[all gasp]

</line>


<line>
- Oh!

- Damn!

</line>


<line>
- Oh, dear.

- Whoa-oh-oh. Um--

</line>


<line>
Darling, please, I wanted

to do this in a public place

so you wouldn't make a scene.

</line>


<line>
You think I won't make

a scene, you limey bastard?

</line>


<line>
Then you really

don't know me at all.

</line>


<line>
Hey, everyone!

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants to see me take a dump

on that sofa?

</line>


<line>
And then she took a dump

on a sofa

made out of a reclaimed

propeller.

</line>


<line>
Where's <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> now?

</line>


<line>
I checked her into Promises.

28 days, she'll be good as new.

</line>


<line>
How did it feel

to check the girl

you raised on television

into rehab?

</line>


<line>
It was tough.

</line>


<line>
I would have liked

to reconnect with her.

</line>


<line>
At least we got to bond a little

on the drive to Malibu.

</line>


<line>
I can see my organs.

</line>


<line>
Oh, whoa! She is losing

a lot of blood, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Beautiful day for a drive,

though, huh?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe the two of you

can catch up some more

when she gets out of rehab.

</line>


<line>
People don't usually want to

hang out with me after rehab.

</line>


<line>
I'm really more

of a before-rehab friend.

</line>


<line>
I think it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

a long time

before I see <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> again.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horse whinnying doorbell ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> could that be?

</line>


<line>
Look, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I appreciate

what you were trying to do,

but I don't need rehab.

Look, good as new, huh?

</line>


<line>
Oh, great,

well, that's a relief.

</line>


<line>
Uh, should you be taking

all those pills?

</line>


<line>
It's

dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

</line>


<line>
- I got it from a doctor.

- Your doctor or just a doctor?

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

some doctor, okay?

</line>


<line>
I met him at <name type="PERSON">Adam</name> Levine's

Halloween party.

</line>


<line>
I think he said

his name was Dr. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I don't think

that was--

</line>


<line>
Ohh, <name type="PERSON">God</name> damn.

</line>


<line>
Uh, are you supposed to be

snorting it like that?

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

What are you, the paramedic

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> restarted my heart at

<name type="PERSON">Adam</name> Levine's Halloween party?

</line>


<line>
Okay, so before we

put to bed the whole

</line>


<line>
- you going to rehab thing--

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, all my life,

</line>


<line>
I've never been forced

to confront my problems head on.

</line>


<line>
No one has ever said "no" to me,

ever, so is it cool

if instead of confronting

my problems head on,

</line>


<line>
I just hide out here

for a little bit?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

I hear what you're saying,

and I think I know

what you need.

</line>


<line>
You just need

a strong, responsible adult

to say, "Yes.

Yes, you can move in with me."

</line>


<line>

<line>
Uh, what's going on

</line>


<line>
Morning, sleepy-pooh,

you want pancakes?

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

that sounds great.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, tough break, champ.

I just gave the last one

to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

as long as you want.

</line>


<line>
You have a guest room?

</line>


<line>
Why have I been sleeping

on the couch for five years?

</line>


<line>
You'll get the guest room when

you've earned the guest room.

</line>


<line>
These pancakes are so good.

</line>


<line>
All <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> ever wanted to eat

was stupid lasagna.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> Garfield

loves lasagna?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to talk

about him!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, can you drive me

to the mall today?

</line>


<line>
I really want to go shopping,

but I'm not allowed to drive

because somebody got a DUI.

</line>


<line>
Uh, that somebody was you,

right?

</line>


<line>
I don't have to answer

your questions!

</line>


<line>
What are you,

the cop that pulled me over

after <name type="PERSON">Adam</name> Levine's

Halloween party?

</line>


<line>
Honey, do you really think

going to the mall's a good idea?

</line>


<line>
I seem to recall another time

you went shopping

when things got

pretty out of control.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's too much, man!

to talk about it!

- Whatever,

I don't want to go

to the stupid mall.

I'll just tell my friends

to come here.

closed the wound with duct tape.

<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko is actually

and she's really great.

</line>


<line>
Is she?

I've heard that.

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize you were

so into house music.

</line>


<line>
Look, I asked her

to turn it down, but apparently,

this volume was prescribed

by Dr. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>

to treat something called

"uptight dickhead disease."

</line>


<line>
What do you-- What do you think

about <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't really think

about her all that much.

</line>


<line>
I mean, obviously,

I'm a fan of her early work

which both satirized

and celebrated

youth culture's obsession

with sex,

but I do wonder

as a third-wave feminist

if it's even possible for women

to reclaim their sexuality

in this deeply entrenched

patriarchal society,

or if claiming to do so

is just a lie we tell ourselves

so we can more comfortably cater

to the male gaze.

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what?

- But you know,

on the other hand, I worry

that conversations like this one

often dismiss her as a mere

puppet of the industry...

</line>


<line>
- That's my same worry.

- ...incapable of engaging

</line>


<line>
- in these discussions herself...

- Obviously.

</line>


<line>
...and infantilization,

which is itself a product

</line>


<line>
- of the deeply misogynistic...

- So deep.

</line>


<line>
...society we live in.

But like I said,

</line>


<line>
I don't really think about her

all that much.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well,

that is very interesting,

but I was more asking,

like, what do you think

about her living here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, what was

your relationship like

with her when you were working

on the show?

</line>


<line>
It was very good,

very professional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

</line>


<line>
- I want to be an architect.

- [laughing] Sweetheart,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mommy</name> didn't do what <name type="PERSON">Mommy</name> did

- Wait, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

um, what are you doing

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

I'll probably just go

to the amusement park,

maybe the circus,

fly a kite on the beach,

watch the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>set,

then I'll head

back to my place

to watch any number

of <name type="ORG">Disney</name> princess movies

while eating ice cream

straight from the tub.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, that sounds like

so much f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Can I come?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm> Yeah,

like I want to spend my weekend

hanging out with a little girl.

[laughing] Good one!

</line>


<line>
You should write

for the Shouts and Murmurs.

</line>


<line>
See you Monday!

</line>


<line>
So the makeup

they were putting on you

was not for the show,

it was just for the weekend?

</line>


<line>
Why does that matter?

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying

to understand the story.

</line>


<line>
Do you think it's possible

that you inviting <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

into your house now is your way

of compensating for not--

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

I'm just helping out a friend.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying to play out

some weird, sick dad fantasy,

or resolve a deep guilt

for past neglect,

or even try to retroactively fix

my own childhood

by recreating someone else's,

and I'm especially not doing

all those things at once!

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
- [loud crash]

- What happened?

</line>


<line>
Did somebody hurt

my precious baby?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>! Ah!

What the--?

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I told my friends they could

tear this wall out to build

a sweet cocaine booth/sex

closet.

</line>


<line>
- Is that cool?

- No, that's not cool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>. Way to harsh the vibe,

Kissinger.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't realize.

</line>


<line>
I thought this was a place

where <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

could finally be <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

but I guess...

that's too much, man.

</line>


<line>
I always loved

that catch phrase.

</line>


<line>
Can your friends at least take

the artwork off the wall first?

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

I want to say yes, but no.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, good talk.

- Wha-- Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
The reason I have called

this house meeting is--

</line>


<line>
Todd, how many times

have we been over this?

</line>


<line>
You don't have the authority

to call house meetings.

</line>


<line>
Only I can call a house meeting.

You can propose a house meeting.

</line>


<line>
All right, fine, fine, fine,

but the reason I propose

</line>


<line>
- this house meeting--

- Your proposal has been

submitted and

is under board review.

</line>


<line>
- Proposal denied.

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, this <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> thing

is getting out of control, okay?

She's taking advantage of you.

</line>


<line>
What? No she's not.

We have a special relationship.

</line>


<line>
You couldn't possibly

understand.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Look at what

she's done to your house.

</line>


<line>
All right, look, I mean,

I stepped on a needle earlier.

</line>


<line>
I think I'm addicted

to heroin now,

so now, that's probably

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
I have to say,

I agree with Todd.

</line>


<line>
You're not this girl's father,

and you're not doing her

any favors by refusing

to set boundaries.

</line>


<line>
Look, I played a dad

for nine years on TV,

so I think I know a little bit

more about parenting

than you two jokers.

The kids on <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around</ital>

didn't need boundaries.

</line>


<line>
All they needed was

some good, old-fashioned love.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

This is not a TV show, okay?

</line>


<line>
This is real life.

</line>


<line>
Ah! Lemur on fire!

Lemur on fire!

</line>


<line>
Some good, old-fashioned love,

and I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give it to her.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give it to her

so... hard.

</line>


<line>
You know, I feel like

we don't ever hang out.

</line>


<line>
Here you are, milady,

a gin and nutmeg

just like you asked.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

Too much nutmeg.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know what

would taste even better?

</line>


<line>
An endorsement

for a <name type="NORP">Slovakian</name> yogurt.

</line>


<line>
Could <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko

get you that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko got <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>

<ital>The Social Network</ital>,

and she has skybox seats

at the Staples Center.

</line>


<line>
- What do you have?

- Well, I've got a table

at the Comedy Central roast

of <name type="PERSON">Gloria Stein</name>--

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, what say

we spend the day together,

just you and me,

away from all the haters?

</line>


<line>
- I want to say yes, but--

- Great, let's go.

Well, that's horrible.

Why would you tell me that now?

I don't know. The <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name> setting

your TV Guide award?

It's the most prestigious

I always thought if I ever

I'd give it to them one day.

I want you to have it.

Okay, party's over.

Everybody out.

<line>
- [all] Aw!

- Not you.

</line>


<line>
You are in big trouble,

<name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung lady.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe

you pawned my award.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't personal. I just

thought your award was stupid,

and I already have

a billion other awards,

and I wanted to get money

for drugs.

</line>


<line>
Look, things have been tough

for you, and I understand that.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're

going through right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm> Oh, you know

what I'm going through? Why?

</line>


<line>
Because you were on some dumb

kids show a million years ago?

</line>


<line>
- Hey, now.

- I had my own fashion line

when I was ten.

By 20, I was packing stadiums.

</line>


<line>
I get letters every day

from boys telling me

that I was the first girl

they masturbated to.

</line>


<line>
Literally, someone

tells me that every day.

</line>


<line>
- That is gross.

- Oh-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>, I know!

</line>


<line>
You sit up here

in your little house

and feel sorry for yourself?

Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

in order to be a has-been,

you have to have actually,

</line>


<line>
- you know, been.

- You are way out of line!

</line>


<line>
You're not my dad.

You're just a rugged, older man

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> provided me with a strong,

masculine presence

during my formative years.

</line>


<line>
I'm not your dad,

and you're not my child.

</line>


<line>
We're just a man and a lady

living in a house together,

and we're both adults,

and we're both a little drunk.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>-o-o lit my ottoman

on fire?

</line>


<line>
Seriously,

you seriously don't know?

</line>


<line>
I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you are bad,

very bad!

</line>


<line>
You want me to put it out

with my boob?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what?

- Your boob

is a very impractical way

to put out a fire.

</line>


<line>
What is happening?

</line>


<line>
I think you have

a serious drug problem.

</line>


<line>
The only drug I need

is horse.

</line>


<line>
Guys, guys,

what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Please don't do this.

[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
No, no. Why are you--

[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
- [whinnies]

- This is a very bad idea.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning]</nonVerbComm>

Can I at least get my blanket--

</line>


<line>
Let me get my blanket

out from under--

</line>


<line>
Oh G-- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, my arm.

</line>


<line>
- You got my arm.

- [laughs] Ow! Ow!

</line>


<line>
I'm in it now.

Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, no! I'm a part of it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I still haven't regained

the feeling in my fingers.

</line>


<line>
That was the longest two minutes

of my life.

</line>


<line>
Um, I think it was a little

longer than two minutes.

</line>


<line>
It was longer

than two minutes.

</line>


<line>
How do you not get

that this is terrible?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you mean

from a P.R. standpoint?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,

oh, I would get flayed!

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm done being

the voice of reason.

</line>


<line>
It's exhausting.

I got to take an angry nap.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

</line>


<line>
I know. I know.

She's taking advantage of me.

</line>


<line>
Actually, it kind of feels

like you're the one

taking advantage of her.

She's the one

with substance abuse problems

and daddy issues.

</line>


<line>
Hey, we both have

substance abuse problems

</line>


<line>
- and daddy issues.

- Yeah, but she came to you

</line>


<line>
- for help.

- [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Hey, notice how

I've been ignoring you,

playing hard to get?

Only makes you want me more.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Go stand

on the other side of the room.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, get your coat.

</line>


<line>
- I'm taking you to rehab.

- Nah,

</line>


<line>
I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> keep hanging out

here if that's all right.

</line>


<line>
- No, it's not all right.

- What?

</line>


<line>
This place isn't good

for you.

</line>


<line>
You need to go where you can

get help, real help.

</line>


<line>
But I thought you were always

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be there for me

like you said.

</line>


<line>
I will always

be there for you.

</line>


<line>
Cut, let's take ten.

</line>


<line>
That's ten, everyone.

Let's make it a tight ten.

</line>


<line>
- These pages are shit.

- [coughs]

you understand?

Shit.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't wipe my ass

with these pages.

</line>


<line>
It would defeat the whole

purpose of wiping my ass.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne for you.

- Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
You get me points

on the back end?

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- Well, I told you

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do it

unless I get points.

</line>


<line>
Oh, they can't find any?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe they could

suck some out of my dick!

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- I'm on the phone.

</line>


<line>
- You're being very rude.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
You promised me you would

always be there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

this is for your own good.

</line>


<line>
You can't stay here anymore.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Okie-doke</name>.

I guess I'll just move out

and find

one of the billion people

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> will let me party

at their house.

</line>


<line>
Uh, well,

you should not do that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know. I know,

but I can, so I will.

</line>


<line>
I'm at a place right now

where I never need

to grow as a person

or rise to an occasion

because I can constantly

just surround myself

with sycophants and enablers

until I die tragically <name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung.

</line>


<line>
- Wh-What?

- Yeah,

it's pretty much

too late for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, them's the breaks.

Take it sleazy, everybody.

</line>


<line>
Oh, by the way,

I called <name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> Gecko,

and I'm meeting with her

tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
- Thanks for the suggestion.

- No! No, no, no, no, no!

</line>


<line>
Hey, you guys want to hear

my new catchphrase?

</line>


<line>
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[blows raspberry]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Laura</name>, the dummy took the bait.

Now for phase two.

</line>


<line>
Is she gone?

Is it safe to come out?

</line>


<line>
Leak to the trades

that <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name> Garfield's agent

is taking meetings with his ex,

get it all over town,

wait an hour,

then get me lunch with <name type="PERSON">Andrew</name>

on the books for this weekend,

someplace <name type="NORP">Italian</name>.

</line>


<line>
I really blew it,

didn't I?

</line>


<line>
I mean, maybe you could

have been a better role model

when she was <name type="PERSON">yo</name>ung, but also,

she never really had a chance.

</line>


<line>
This is what our celebrity

culture does to people.

</line>


<line>
So what you're saying is,

Everything is society's fault,

and we as individuals

never need

to take responsibility

for anything?

</line>


<line>
Uh, no. Not exactly.

I was just saying that--

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I like that.

I didn't do anything wrong

because I can't do

anything wrong

because we're all just products

of our environment,

bouncing around like marbles

in the game

of Hungry Hungry Hippos

that is our random

and cruel universe.

</line>


<line>
Wait, no, that's not even

what I'm saying--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, It's not my fault.

It's society.

</line>


<line>
Everything is

because of society!

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, that--

- Dude, just let him have this.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>!

Everything is meaningless!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Nothing I do</ital>

<ital>has consequence!</ital>

</line>


<line>
So what'd you get,

anything good?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I got everything.
