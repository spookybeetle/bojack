Sorry, missed it!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld learn to talk louder, dude!

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er about you

getting the nomination,

but then, it turning out

that you didn't get the nomination.

</line>


<line>
It was big news yesterday.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I got royally screwed,

know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was there for me?

</line>


<line>
No one, because everyone's an ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

and the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le world sucks balls.

</line>


<line>
-Anyway, thanks for having me over.

-I'm with you, man.

</line>


<line>
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.

Why would I make my body a temple?

</line>


<line>
I've been to <name type="PERSON">T</name>emple.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>emple is super boring.

</line>


<line>
What do you say

we go on an epic bender?

</line>


<line>
Yes! Let's get higher

than a stilt walker's dick!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I'm talking about.

Let's get some booze and drugs.

</line>


<line>
We can clear out my bank acco<name type="ORG">un</name>t.

I got nothing left I care about.

</line>


<line>
What do you mean "get"?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use is booze and drugs.

</line>

-Here.

Ee-yah!

[snorting]

</line>


<line>
Cocaine-- No! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's drywall.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Where the hell

did I hide the cocaine?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, I also told

the liquor store to deliver.

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>o nine months of sobriety.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>o life and being done with it!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay. What about this one?

</line>


<line>
Remember when Erika <name type="PERSON">Ele</name>niak

guest starred as <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>ber's cousin

from out of town,

and <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> had a boner

for the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le episode?

</line>


<line>
-What? No.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can totally see it in every scene.

</line>


<line>
Cold open, boner! Act one, boner!

</line>


<line>
Co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial break-- <name type="ORG">"Hello</name>, we're from

the <name type="ORG">Wheaties</name> corporation!" Back to boners!

</line>


<line>
Okay, we'll put it on the list.

We gotta watch that one.

</line>


<line>
What about the one where the writers

made <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle dress up like a pumpkin,

and the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le episode was fat jokes,

so then <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle got an eating disorder?

</line>


<line>
Everything was so much simpler back then.

</line>


<line>
She had to go to a clinic.

She missed, like, five episodes.

</line>


<line>
We didn't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w good we had it.

</line>


<line>
We got to come to work

and have f<name type="ORG">un</name> every day,

and we weren't worried

about our le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>cy or awards.

</line>


<line>
...because buildings are supposed

to be rectangles, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Wait, what were we talking about?

</line>


<line>
We were talking about <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you had to go pee.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you came back

covered in toilet paper

and pretended to be a mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>y.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you took it all off

because you decided <name type="GPE">Egypt</name> was stupid,

especially pyramids,

because you think triangle buildings are,

and I quote, "<name type="PERSON">ga</name>uche as shit."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat does so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like me,

but I don't remember any of that.

</line>


<line>
I must have blacked out.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld lay off the alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l for--

</line>


<line>
...and I said, <name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name>'re sitting

on the pizza, Mr. President."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a! I think I just had another one.

-Another what? Pizza?

</line>


<line>
No, blackout. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he thing

we were just talking about.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ry to keep up here.

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>om! <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ner! Pay up!

What did I tell you?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not a boner. It's a shadow.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, I think we all learned</ital>

<ital>a valuable lesson today</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>about the <name type="NORP">Armenian</name> genocide.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="NORP">Armenian</name> genocide</ital>

<ital>was too much, man!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[audience laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
All right! Next episode.

</line>


<line>
Why can't life be like it was

on <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?</ital>

</line>


<line>
All our issues conveniently settled

in 22 hilarious minutes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, it's amazing

that it's le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l for kids to be actors.

</line>


<line>
How is that not child labor?

I didn't know what I was signing up for.

</line>


<line>
-I was three.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is getting me depressed.

</line>


<line>
-Let's do something f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

-Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he planetarium!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u get crazy high in the parking lot,

then you go in and get your mind blown

by all the trippy <name type="PERSON">ga</name>laxies and shit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds stupid.

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be in charge of the f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[snorting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

No, no, no! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was drywall.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, we have to start

marking our drugs more clearly.

</line>


<line>
-Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>o!

</line>


<line>
-[male voice] It was just so hard.

-Wha--? What the--?

</line>


<line>
I was stuck in a terrifying cycle

of drinking, lifting my head up,

drinking, lifting my head up,

drinking, lifting my head up.

</line>


<line>
Coffee, stale donuts, attention <name type="PERSON">ho</name>gs

telling boring stories about themselves?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>! Are we at a 12-step meeting?

-Now, you're a detective?

</line>


<line>
Last night, you couldn't even solve

the mystery of where the toilet is.

</line>


<line>
So, all our partying was

an elaborate trick

just to get me to go sober?

</line>


<line>
No, Detective <name type="PERSON">Pukes</name>

in the Washing <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>chine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're here because I couldn't

leave you alone in my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

and I had to come today.

</line>


<line>
Gotta get my nine-month chip.

</line>


<line>
Chip? We've been wasted for...

31 <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's no reason for me

to not get my chip.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's literally exactly the reason

you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't get your chip.

</line>


<line>
Nowhere in the 12 steps

does it say to not drink.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not actually one of the steps.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>op<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake a swig.

</line>


<line>
If you have to listen to losers talk

about their shitty sober lives,

it's a lot more f<name type="ORG">un</name> to be buzzed.

</line>


<line>
And I realized people don't change

because they want to change.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey change because they have to change.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>o!

</line>


<line>
Oh, booing is generally

frowned upon here.

</line>


<line>
How else am I supposed to express

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w boring these stories are?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[speaking slowly]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Hi, <name type="PERSON">Simon</name>.

</line>


<line>
My rock bottom was

when I actually woke up <name type="ORG">un</name>der a rock.

</line>


<line>
Can't get lower than that.

</line>


<line>
Come on!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u people call yourself dr<name type="ORG">un</name>ks?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>st of this is stuff I do

on a daily basis completely sober.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rust me, pal,

we've done some awful things.

</line>


<line>
One time, I didn't want

my friend to move out,

so I used character actress <name type="PERSON">Ann Dowd</name>

to help me sabotage his hip-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>pera.

</line>


<line>
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u so-called dr<name type="ORG">un</name>ks want

something to feel shitty about?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, maybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go.

-I got somethin' for ya. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a.

</line>


<line>
My name is <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

Hi, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, like you didn't know?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I once went all the way down

to <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name> to see a woman that I knew,

and she had a yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g daughter, <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Penn</name>y <name type="PERSON">Carson</name>. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's her real name.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can look her up. I don't care.

</line>


<line>
And first, I tried to sleep

with the mom, but she said no.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, I tried to sleep with the daughter.

-[all groaning]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, the mom walked in on me

trying to sleep with the daughter,

and I was like,

"<name type="PERSON">Oop</name>sie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he worst part is, I don't even know

what happened after I left.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I ruin the family?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I scar that little girl for life?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
And that's just, like,

one of a billion things

that I have going through my head

all the time.

</line>


<line>
So, anyone got a better story than that?

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>dn't think so, bitches.

</line>


<line>
Where's my trophy, or chip,

or whatever?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was impressive, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I've never seen them cancel an <name type="ORG">AA</name> meeting

because everyone got bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ed out before.

</line>


<line>
Uh, what are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told everyone about that <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y chick.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you went on and on

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you're never going to change.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you chased the slug aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

threatening to pour salt on his head.

</line>


<line>
-I talked about <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y?

-Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.

</line>


<line>
-[tires squealing]

-[loud crash]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>st of us aren't as proud of it

as you seem to be.

</line>


<line>
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible that

I might have really messed that girl up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, she's fine.

I looked her up on <name type="ORG">Facebook</name>.

</line>


<line>
She's going to <name type="GPE">Oberlin</name>,

likes <name type="PERSON">T</name>hai food and the smell of a fire

on the first really cold day of winter.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat doesn't mean anything.

Everyone likes the smell of fire

on the first cold day of winter.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I used to feel just like you

before I got into this "12 steps" thing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey taught me <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to make amends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just say you're sorry

for the things you did

and you get a clean slate.

</line>


<line>
-So, what? Just dirty up the slate a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, you just make amends a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
It's a never-ending cycle,

where you always end up

feeling good about yourself.

</line>


<line>
-[man] No!

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his may be the nitrous

and bath salts talking,

but I want to do some more

nitrous and bath salts.

</line>


<line>
-[tires squealing]

-[crash]

</line>


<line>
And then, let's make

some goddamn amends.

-Oh. Hey, kid!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry your lame dad built

such a cheap-ass play<name type="PERSON">ho</name>use!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints

to support that fo<name type="ORG">un</name>dation, <name type="GPE">dumbshi</name>t!

<line>
-Also, suck a dick!

-So, we wait.

<line>
I need to make amends to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

It's only been, like, ten minutes.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have a real thing with food.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what happens when you mix

the appetite of a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I'm sorry

I said mean things to you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's cool. I forgive you.

Wait, would my character say that?

</line>


<line>
What's <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane's deal a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

She's, like, an <name type="NORP">Asian</name> Daria?

</line>

-She's a little more complex.

-But she's basically <name type="NORP">Asian</name> Daria, right?

</line>

and her w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le "blah" thing.

<line>
Okay, shut up.

Now, I'll be Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

and you make amends to me.

And, now, you be Mr. <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn

When you make amends,

don't you just feel lighter?

</line>


<line>
Well, I also ate

a shit ton of <name type="ORG">Bugles</name>, so no.

But I do feel like we got to the bottom

-It was all of us.

-Next stop, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, I'm sorry. I want to take

it must be to make amends.

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, when I was in college,

I had a job as a lifeguard...

<line>
Wait, did we just go to <name type="PERSON">Ana</name>'s <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I get closure?

</line>


<line>
If by "closure" you mean

I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.

</line>


<line>
We gotta go back.

</line>


<line>
-What the hell?

-I know I was just here,

but I feel like you told me

some important story

that explained everything about us.

</line>


<line>
Unfort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately, I totally spaced it.

</line>


<line>
Gotta be <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest.

I've had a couple beers.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

if it'll make you leave.

</line>


<line>
When I was a lifeguard, I...

</line>


<line>
-Oh, crud.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want to go back to <name type="PERSON">Ana</name>'s, don't you?

get it this time.

-One more time?

-No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his time I wrote it down.

"I'm a lifeguard. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his woman's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

Okay, so I know

I keep bothering you tonight.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>onight? I haven't seen you

in two weeks.

</line>


<line>
Oh, really?

</line>


<line>
I just need to know what you were

trying to tell me about being a lifeguard,

and then, I'll leave

and you'll never see me a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
M<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
After I almost drowned, I decided

I would never a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in be weaker than water.

</line>


<line>
So, I became a lifeguard.

</line>


<line>
On my first day of training,

my instructor told me

that there are going to be times

when you'll see someone in trouble.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're going to want to rush in there

and do whatever you can to save them,

but you have to stop yourself,

because there are some people

you can't save.

</line>


<line>
'Cause t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se people

will thrash and struggle

and try to take you down with them.

</line>


<line>
What does that have to do with me?

</line>


<line>
What the--?

Where the hell are we now?

</line>


<line>
-Ohi--

-<name type="ORG">Ojai</name>?

</line>


<line>
-We drove all the way to <name type="ORG">Ojai</name>?

-Let me finish.

</line>


<line>
Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Ohio</name>.

-We drove all the way to <name type="GPE">Ohio</name>?!

</line>


<line>
I wanted to go to the planetarium,

but you <name type="NORP">dem</name>anded we come here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said you had to make

one more amend, to that <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y girl.

</line>


<line>
What? No! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is a terrible idea.

</line>


<line>
-Let's turn this car aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d right now.

-[tires squealing]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
-I feel we didn't turn the car aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

-No, we did,

but then, you turned it back aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

because you really wanted

to find that deer girl,

so we decided to do a stakeout.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le makeover sequence,

where we went to the mall

and tried on different trench coats

for each other.

</line>


<line>
Do you not remember any of that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is insane.

I already scarred her for life.

</line>


<line>
If I see her a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, I'll just end up

getting my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rribleness all over her.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think it's too late for me

to go to college?

</line>


<line>
I always wanted to be an architect.

</line>


<line>
But one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se architects,

where, at night,

she's a high-end call girl,

and, by day,

she's an international superspy.

</line>


<line>
-So, when is she an architect?

-I don't know. Frontier times?

</line>


<line>
No, I didn't mean what era.

</line>


<line>
If she's a call girl at night

and a spy during the day--

</line>


<line>
-Hey, look, <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y.

-Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, what's she doing?

</line>


<line>
-Does she look emotionally damaged?

-She's just going to the computer.

</line>


<line>
She's probably in a sex chat room

with some middle-aged <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse

because that's the only way

she can still feel love.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, probably.

-Or she's so upset about what you did

that she's using the Internet

to find ways to co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>it suicide.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat makes even more sense.

</line>


<line>
All right, we've established

that you ruined her.

</line>


<line>
-Can we go back to L.A. now?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
So... obviously, I wanted to keep

following <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y because I'm an idiot.

</line>


<line>
Let's just nip this in the bud.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> write "Do not follow <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y"

on my hands

in the <name type="ORG">un</name>likely scenario

of my blacking out a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
I'll just write "Follow <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y"

on this hand,

and then, on this hand, I'll write...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">God</name></name>damn it!

-What?

<line>

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>? I don't know.

I haven't spoken to her in years.

</line>


<line>
Besides, she's not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

want to do this.

</line>


<line>
She's the world's biggest pop star.

</line>


<line>
She's the only <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe we have

to keep this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w alive.

</line>


<line>
Would you ask her?

I'm sure she'd do it for you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're like a father to her.

-What is what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were mumbling about

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you had to ask me something.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w long

have we known each other?

</line>


<line>
-Feels like our entire lives.

-Well, my entire life, pretty much.

</line>


<line>
We were on a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

Isn't that insane?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, sometimes it feels like you're

the only one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> really <name type="ORG">un</name>derstands me,

because <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w could anyone else?

</line>


<line>
Nobody knows what we went through,

nobody w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wasn't on that s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
But we knew each other

before we were anybody,

and that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w we can be friends,

because we're not like t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se other people.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> glom onto you

because of w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> they think you are,

and they think they can sleep

on your couch and eat your food.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey think you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

save their agency.

</line>


<line>
I never asked for that kind of pressure,

but you and me, we don't want

anything from each other.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I... I could never

figure out what love meant,

but, right now, I don't need

to figure out anything.

</line>


<line>
I just feel it.

I love you, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

When I was a kid,

And, now, I've done it and...

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>... I don't...

like anything about me.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only reason I wear this shirt

is because some company

paid me $8,000 to wear it.

</line>


<line>
And I don't even need the money.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[scoffs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I just liked that someone

still wanted me to wear their shirt.

</line>


<line>
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

Everything's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do?

I don't know what to do.

</line>


<line>
Am I doomed? Are you doomed?

Are we all doomed?

</line>


<line>
No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.

I always forget that there are

more than just the six stars

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's cool, too,

but I meant this building.

</line>


<line>
It's a giant dome.

Domes are so cool.

I prefer rectangular buildings,
