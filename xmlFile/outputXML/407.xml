<line>
<name type="PERSON">Whew</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

-I'm back in <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>

</line>


<line>
-I should have called you--

-Yeah. You should have.

</line>


<line>
-I said I was sorry.

-No, you didn't.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Good to hear from you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

-No--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
Okay, thank you.

</line>


<line>
What's going on here?

</line>


<line>
Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter

for <name type="GPE">California</name> campaign.

</line>


<line>
-All right, I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>--

-Sorry. It's a fundraiser.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
I love your ironic take

on black-tie attire.

</line>


<line>
It really says,

"I truly don't care what you think of me."

</line>


<line>
This light bulb won't let me in

to your house without paying.

</line>


<line>
Ah, sorry about that.

Gotta raise those funds.

</line>


<line>
-Can't I just--

-Thanks for your support, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Means so much. Erica!

-Hey--

</line>


<line>
Look at you,

with the right number of ears!

</line>


<line>
-Look, I just--

-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[growls]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...!

-[pops]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you have another bathroom?

They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

</line>


<line>
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

</line>


<line>
Because if I were pregnant, it would be

bad luck to tell you this early.

</line>


<line>
Presuming it was early.

But I'm not pregnant.

</line>


<line>
This is just a normal,

non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

</line>


<line>
-There's a bathroom in the pool house.

-You're a lifesaver.

</line>


<line>
Pardon me! Out of my way.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

</line>


<line>
Because you are looking

"gorges" this evening.

</line>


<line>
Well, I must be in <name type="NORP">Nazi</name> Germany,

because you're "not so" bad yourself.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, yours was better.

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] Hi.

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[munches]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, I should go.

</line>


<line>
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife

is talking to my other ex-wife.

</line>


<line>
-You have two ex-wives here?

-<name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>'s his campaign manager.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> And <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Biel loves

getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.

</line>


<line>
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,

in the same room! This is great.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'm busy.

</line>


<line>
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, because you <name type="PERSON">disapp--</name>

No, I am not doing this now.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you get yourself a drink?

-I will get a drink.

</line>


<line>
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

[crunches]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Norman</name>, we have to support the--

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, yes.

-All right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>. <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey there. Famous actor <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>,

how you doing?

</line>


<line>
-[glass clinks]

-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.

</line>


<line>
We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> beat that scoundrel

<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name> <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>...

</line>


<line>
Boo!

</line>


<line>
...and bring likability back to politics.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking

pals for being here tonight.

</line>


<line>
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"

but we did it anyway,

and it all worked out.

Love you, sweetie.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
Finally-- oh!

Sorry about that, folks.

</line>


<line>
I sensed an earthquake.

Must have been a false--

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey now!

</line>


<line>
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

</line>


<line>
Listen to me,

I'm the dog w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cried earthquake.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[bangs]

-[voices overlapping]

</line>


<line>
-We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> die!

-Oh, fudge!

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-I can't die!

</line>


<line>
I'm not famous enough yet to make

the "In <name type="PERSON">Memoriam</name>" montage at the Oscars!

</line>


<line>
I have so many regrets!

</line>


<line>
I just picked up a family sitcom

where the mom is a zombie!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moans]</nonVerbComm>

It's called<ital> Mombie, </ital>and it's terrible!

</line>


<line>
I have a condition where every time

I sense a shift in power dynamics,

</line>


<line>
I have a tiny orgasm!

</line>


<line>
I have no original ideas,

I just repeat things I hear.

</line>


<line>
-I've never been in love!

-I've never been in love!

</line>


<line>
I tried gay at theater camp!

</line>


<line>
I regret <ital>everything!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Peanutbutter] Whoa!

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> laughs]

</line>


<line>
-[crashes]

-[all gasp]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[voices overlapping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
Is anyone getting any bars?

I'm not getting any baa-rs.

</line>


<line>
Can someone validate my valet ticket?

I would like to go home now.

</line>


<line>
There's no way out.

Okay. Everybody stay sane.

</line>


<line>
I propose we set each other on fire

for warmth.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants to be set on fire first?

Not me, I'm <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Biel.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, that's right.

</line>


<line>
The natives are getting restless,

</line>


<line>
so why don't you say something

to comfort them?

</line>


<line>
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

</line>


<line>
No one's going to light anyone on fire.

</line>


<line>
For one thing,

that'd eat up a lot of oxygen

and w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows

how much we have down here.

</line>


<line>
-[man] I want oxygen!

-[man screams] Air! I need air!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[guests screaming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
-You okay, sweetie?

-I think so.

</line>


<line>
-That was really scary.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
At least we know no one

is specifically at fault.

</line>


<line>
Well, except for <name type="LOC">San Andreas</name>.

</line>


<line>
This was because you fracked

under our house.

</line>


<line>
I told you fracking was dangerous,

and you didn't listen.

</line>


<line>
And now our house is ruined

and we're trapped underground,

and we're all going to die!

</line>


<line>
-Is this one of our sexy fights?

-[yells] No!

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

</line>


<line>
You can be mad at me or get drunk

with me, but you can't do both.

</line>


<line>
Watch me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, what the shit?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[creaks, crashes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, fish.

-[Todd] Uh... hello?

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing in there?

-Uh, I live here.

</line>


<line>
Didn't you know

there was a huge party going on?

</line>


<line>
I was going to go to the party

after my bath,

but then I realized

the bath <ital>was </ital>the party.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm not waiting around

to be rescued like some chump.

</line>


<line>
Come on, let's go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm> Whoa...!

</line>


<line>
-We gotta go in there?

-Well, I don't see any other way.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes life is like the second season

of <ital>Friday Night Lights</ital>--

you gotta push through

and hope there's better stuff ahead.

</line>


<line>
Aw-ww!

</line>


<line>
Guys, let's all try to just stay cool

and make the best of things, huh?

</line>


<line>
"Make the best of things"? You idiot,

we're trapped and we're terrified.

</line>


<line>
Okay, settle down,

you future hard <ital>Jeopardy</ital> question.

</line>


<line>
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.

</line>


<line>
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?

</line>


<line>
How are we supposed to make

the best of things?

</line>


<line>
-We're stuck underground.

-This is true.

</line>


<line>
But most of us are important celebrities,

so someone will come for us soon.

</line>


<line>
And for you regulars,

I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!

</line>


<line>
What do we do till then?

</line>


<line>
We're actors! I say we put on a show.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s with me?

</line>


<line>
A show? W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> will be the star?

Me, I assume.

</line>


<line>
Sure you'll be the star,

and you'll be the star!

</line>


<line>
And you'll be the star!

We'll all be the star!

</line>


<line>
Folks, I promise you

we will be out of here in no time.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And that's when I realized...

</line>


<line>
I just don't have the face for bangs.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, thank you so much.

You're too kind! Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ebe, for that rousing

<ital>Tale from the Above Ground. </ital>W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s next?

</line>


<line>
I can't take this anymore.

I need to get out.

</line>


<line>
This is the longest I've gone

without moisturizing,

</line>


<line>
-and I feel like a lizard!

-Humph.

</line>


<line>
-No offense.

-It's only been 72 hours.

</line>


<line>
I'm missing my general meeting at <name type="ORG">CBS</name>.

I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

</line>


<line>
I can't live like this!

We've gotta light someone on fire.

</line>


<line>
I'm starting to think that less-famous

<name type="PERSON">Michelle Monaghan</name> has the right idea

</line>


<line>
-about lighting people on fire.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Come on, party people, keep it together.

Let's not forget why we're here--

to raise money for my campaign,

and more recently, to not go crazy

and murder each other.

</line>


<line>
Can someone please bring me my car?

It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

</line>


<line>
You're killing me, <name type="PERSON">Zach</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

</line>


<line>
Be the leader that I know you can be.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

</line>


<line>
-[bangs]

-What in the world?

</line>


<line>
<ital>"Vox clamantis in deserto."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-It is I.

-<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name> <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>!

</line>


<line>
-We're saved!

-Wow!

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank <name type="PERSON">God</name>. A leader.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> laughs]

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] Sh.

</line>


<line>
What's going on down here?

Anyone's looking for us?

</line>


<line>
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, have you just been getting drunk

with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> this whole time?

</line>


<line>
-What? I'm still mad at you.

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> laughing]

</line>


<line>
-Citizens, remain calm.

-Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

</line>


<line>
Rescue workers are coming

but it could be a while.

</line>


<line>
State emergency funds have been depleted

due to budget overruns

on a costly bridge to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>

that's being constructed.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah!

</line>


<line>
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,

I came to get you out early.

</line>


<line>
Is that what a woodchuck is?

Why did I think it was like a beaver?

</line>


<line>
What's it like out there, <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>?

Whole neighborhood totaled?

</line>


<line>
-Is the city in chaos?

-No, it's really just your house.

</line>


<line>
Because of all the fracking that's been

happening underneath your house.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Interesting!

</line>


<line>
-Ay-yi-yi.

-Oh, right, right.

</line>


<line>
So you just burrowed down here to rescue

your political opponent's top donors.

</line>


<line>
That's convenient.

</line>


<line>
It was actually very inconvenient,

but I put politics aside

to save you people from dying.

</line>


<line>
Three cheers for <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm>

Hip, hip, hooray!

</line>


<line>
Please, don't cheer too loudly.

The tunnel is very delicate.

</line>


<line>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-Seriously, I think it's best to--

</line>


<line>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-[rumbling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Let's cheer one more time, just for f<name type="ORG">un</name>!

-No, please.

</line>


<line>
-Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...

-<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>!

</line>


<line>
-No!

-[rumbling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screams]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So turns out three cheers was probably

an adequate number of cheers.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-Just keep walking.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, I can't wait to get home.

</line>


<line>
I don't even have a home anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all

my different colored hats I never wear?

</line>


<line>
Well, if you need another couch

to crash on, there's always my place.

</line>


<line>
-Didn't you move in with <name type="PERSON">Ralph</name>?

-Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

</line>


<line>
-Just in case, I guess.

-In case of what?

</line>


<line>
-[faint chattering]

-What was that?

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[yelps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Now, ladies, just calm down.

We can talk about this.

</line>


<line>
What are we <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do, Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ants gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chattering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Did you say you're a princess?

</line>


<line>
-That's just my name. I'm a manager.

-It's like an agent.

</line>


<line>
-It's totally different.

-Is it, though?

</line>


<line>
-Silence! You negotiate deals?

-Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ant leader laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
My hands... they're crushed.

</line>


<line>
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

</line>


<line>
Well, I can dig!

</line>


<line>
Actually, no one should dig.

</line>


<line>
Your foundation is basically <name type="NORP">Swiss</name> cheese.

</line>


<line>
The slightest provocation could cause

another collapse that would crush us all.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I know that because I bought a sitcom

about fracking, <ital>The Frack Shack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's <ital>New Girl</ital> meets fracking.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, no one's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> watch

that show, huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Someone will be coming for us soon.

In the meantime, we must organize.

</line>


<line>
Parcel out food and water

and see how much we've got.

</line>


<line>
-I'll assign team leaders.

-Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[guests chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right. Um...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">God</name>...!

-For you, a banana

</line>


<line>
-because you're so appealing.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

</line>


<line>
I don't think so.

I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

</line>


<line>
-And w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> made you the food captain?

-<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>.

</line>


<line>
Exactly. He's in charge.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

you have not been allocated those rations.

</line>


<line>
I'm a horse. I need more food,

and I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
-Everyone down here is a celebrity.

-Not the caterers.

</line>


<line>
Relinquish the food.

</line>


<line>
Hey. Here's your chance.

</line>


<line>
Actually, <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>, this is my house

and <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> can eat whatever he wants.

</line>


<line>
This man has already reached

his allotted food portion for the day.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> said we have to go by your rules?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> made you leader

of underground?

</line>


<line>
I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take all this and...

</line>


<line>
You've appointed me.

Yes, I under-- citizens, look...

</line>


<line>
Keep it together.

[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Weird stuff going on downstairs.

-[clicking]

</line>


<line>
Humph.

</line>


<line>
-I can't believe this is my life.

-Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
Too much sad booze for you.

Where's the happy booze?

</line>


<line>
I'm trapped underground

and it's all my husband's fault

and I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> die in this mansion

in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But on the bright side--

</line>


<line>
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,

you got a cool job, you got friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, you're right.

</line>


<line>
Even when I was above ground,

I wasn't satisfied.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. I'm the problem!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobbing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

</line>


<line>
No. It...

</line>


<line>
I am! I'm a pit.

</line>


<line>
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, you're not a pit.

</line>


<line>
I'm a pit!

[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I can't believe I'm crying.

This is so dumb.

</line>


<line>
It's okay.

Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

</line>


<line>
You disappeared for a year and a half.

</line>


<line>
So you do want to talk about it.

Just took four solid days of drinking.

</line>


<line>
If you were back in <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>,

why didn't you call me?

</line>


<line>
-I wasn't... ready.

-Ready? For what?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be better

when you saw me again.

</line>


<line>
And I thought I could be, somehow.

But I'm not.

</line>


<line>
And even if I did get better,

the best I could ever be

is still just some other version of me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I can't wait for you to be better.

</line>


<line>
I need you in my life.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-You're the biggest asshole I know,

and you're the only thing

that makes sense to me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> sighs, moans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
People should be able to have

some control over their lives down here.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-People need boundaries.

</line>


<line>
Leadership means

sometimes being the bad guy.

</line>


<line>
You hear that? <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>'s a bad guy!

</line>


<line>
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

</line>


<line>
-That's not...

-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
And I'm the good guy,

so that's two points for me.

</line>


<line>
What points? There are no points.

</line>


<line>
-This is not a game!

-Well, maybe there should be points.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-Points!

</line>


<line>
People seem to like my points idea.

That's another point for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> came down here

to save you in the first place.

</line>


<line>
Surely I get points for that.

</line>


<line>
Asking for points is conceited.

That's more points for me.

</line>


<line>
-He's right!

-What?!

</line>


<line>
If you came down to save us,

why are we still here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-That's right.

</line>


<line>
Minus point for <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>.

</line>


<line>
I implore you not to fall

into a mob mentality.

</line>


<line>
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!

-Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Folks, <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>'s political philosophy

is as broken as his hands.

</line>


<line>
That is a convincing argument.

He does have broken hands.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

</line>


<line>
An outsider like me,

the guy whose house this is.

</line>

-Cool.

</line>


<line>
Are you okay?

I mean, outside of our current situation

of being buried alive

and almost out of alcohol

except for cooking sherry and Midori?

</line>


<line>
It's just been a rough couple years

with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> dying and <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
-And <name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>?

<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>? <name type="PERSON">Jackson-Jackson</name>?

Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

</line>


<line>
You got daughter? <name type="PERSON">Ruh-roh</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[clatters]

-Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

</line>


<line>
Supposed to help her figure out

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> her mother is.

</line>


<line>
But I don't know where to start.

</line>


<line>
Did she try sending mutual consent form

to the adoption agency?

</line>


<line>
What, what words?

</line>


<line>
Well, if it's closed adoption,

you send a mutual consent form.

</line>


<line>
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

</line>


<line>
If Mom says same thing,

boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

</line>


<line>
-How do you know about that?

-I had an adopted brother.

</line>


<line>
And also for a while,

I hoped I was adopted.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Ooh!

</line>

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> dares disturb Queen Antonia?

My name is Princess Carolyn.

I represent the soldiers

of <name type="PERSON">Subcolony K-147</name>,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> feel they're doing all the work

while reaping none of the spoils.

</line>


<line>
Everything my soldiers do

benefits the colony.

I had this same conversation

with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>'s aa-always telling us

He says help is coming,

but how does he know? What if he's lying?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[wails]</nonVerbComm>

And I have still not been validated!

</line>


<line>
If you could all be patient...

</line>


<line>
We're sick of waiting!

It's time for new leadership.

</line>


<line>
That attempted movie star is right!

</line>


<line>
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter

President-for-life of Underground.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[guests]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

Uh, uh, oh!

</line>

-Thank you!

-What? No!

</line>


<line>
-What do we do with <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>?

-He must be made an example of.

</line>


<line>
-[man] Get him!

-Yeah!

</line>


<line>
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

</line>


<line>
We don't need to "get him."

Let's just tie him up someplace

where he can't hurt us anymore

with his dangerous ideas.

</line>


<line>
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.

No, don't-- no...!

</line>


<line>
-[chanting] Peanutbutter!

-No!

</line>


<line>
-Peanutbutter!

-Thank you, thank you all.

</line>


<line>
As my first act as President-for-life,

I declare that everyone

is allowed to eat and drink

whatever they want!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Agh--!

</line>


<line>
I'm starving,

and not the normal celebrity

kind of starving like I always am.

</line>


<line>
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

</line>


<line>
-Where's the food?

-[<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>] You ate all the food.

</line>


<line>
This is it!

</line>


<line>
Nobody's coming for us.

We need to kill someone for food.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...!

-Oh...!

</line>


<line>
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
He has the word "peanut butter"

in his name!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Guys, guys, guys,

maybe we don't need to eat anybody!

</line>


<line>
-[all groan]

-What's this now?

</line>


<line>
Let's listen to the guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s saying don't kill me.

</line>


<line>
He's got some interesting ideas.

</line>


<line>
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

</line>


<line>
I'm known for monologues

that sum things up at the end of the show.

</line>


<line>
I drive a Prius,

which means I'm a good person.

</line>


<line>
Let's not surrender

to our basest instincts.

</line>


<line>
I know times are tough,

but I'm sure if we band together

and really concentrate

on the problem at hand,

we can, as a group of friends--

[screams]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-Biel!

</line>


<line>
The rule of man is over.

Now begins the rule of fire.

</line>


<line>
-[howls] Oh, why?

-<name type="PERSON">Jessica</name>, no.

</line>


<line>
I will no longer be shackled

by the civilized society

of the above ground.

</line>


<line>
This is Underground,

and the only law here is flame.

</line>


<line>
The fire wants not for justice.

The fire wants not for reason.

</line>


<line>
-The fire desires only to be fed!

-Feed the fire!

</line>


<line>
-The fire is my new god!

-[moans] Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,

but the tide has turned

and I side with the fire now.

</line>


<line>
Tonight, we dine on <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Tomorrow, canine cuisine!

-No.

</line>


<line>
You, take him to his spot,

and make him stay.

</line>


<line>
-[squawks]

-No! No! Please!

</line>


<line>
Listen to reason... this time!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulps]</nonVerbComm> Ah-hh!

</line>


<line>
I think that's all of it.

</line>


<line>
I can't go back to my old life sober.

It's so empty.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay.

Here's the secret to being happy.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

</line>


<line>
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually

you'll forget you're pretending.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you're right.

</line>


<line>
I just need to stop complaining

and work harder.

</line>


<line>
Everyone else is doing it.

Why am I so special?

</line>


<line>
-[door bangs]

-Lock him in here!

</line>


<line>
-Please! <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, my sweet wife.

-What's going on?

</line>


<line>
Marvin Gaye.

</line>


<line>
The People of Underground

have a new god, the fire.

</line>


<line>
And for my crimes

I will be fed to its ravenous flames.

</line>


<line>
My only hope is the meat

of <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name> proves lasting,

but I fear by daybreak,

there will be no <name type="PERSON">Braff</name> meat left.

</line>


<line>
-What's going on?

-Four <name type="ORG">Non-Blondes</name>.

</line>


<line>
Everybody out except the prisoner.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] No!

-Easy on the merchandise!

</line>


<line>
Get off me!

</line>


<line>
Well, it's been a tough week,

lots of back and forth,

but I think we've reached an agreement

that meets everybody's needs.

</line>


<line>
"The queen will share

male sex servants with the soldiers

for one night of magnificent,

sensuous splendor,

a gorgeous bacchanal

of hedonistic delights,

with a second orgy pickup option,

pursuant on success of the first."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[hissing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

</line>


<line>
Great. Now can we please return

to the surface world?

</line>


<line>
All my favorite clouds are up there.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I like this one.

He's got moxie and a soft thorax.

</line>


<line>
How did you find your fleshy self

in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

</line>


<line>
We were at this big

<name type="GPE">Beverly Hills</name> fundraiser.

</line>


<line>
There was an earthquake,

and now everyone's trapped underground.

</line>


<line>
Did you say <name type="GPE">Beverly Hills</name>?

Ugh! Of course.

</line>


<line>
Surface dwellers are always moving in

on our territory.

</line>


<line>
First they move here, then taxes go up,

the next thing you know,

there's a <name type="ORG">Whole Foods</name>.

</line>


<line>
How am I supposed to concentrate

on a great orgy

when I've got gentrification on my mind?

</line>


<line>
No, we've got to get

those interlopers out of here.

</line>


<line>
-Let's--

-Hey! Hold on.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-[<name type="PERSON">Jessica</name>] Mr. Peanutbutter,

did you or did you not tell us

we could eat whatever we wanted?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
We gotta do something.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty

thing that's ever happened to me

and now they're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> set him on fire.

</line>


<line>
Okay. What would non-hungover <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> do?

She's smart.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I need water.

</line>


<line>
There is no more water.

That's the problem.

</line>


<line>
"Choodwuck" is right.

</line>


<line>
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?

Like, a well?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah! And we're underground.

-If we dig, we'll get water!

</line>


<line>
-Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.

-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

</line>


<line>
Any last words

before we light you on fire?

</line>


<line>
Yes, if I could just say,

"Don't light me on fire"?

</line>


<line>
The fire bends to no man's will.

Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> Water!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Jessica</name>] What? [gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, wow, it's really water.

-Water is stronger than fire.

</line>


<line>
Wait, let's not really forget how-- ugh!

</line>


<line>
Water is my new god now!

</line>


<line>
Oh, boy.

</line>


<line>
-Clear gold!

-All right, water!

</line>


<line>
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

</line>


<line>
Hang on. It's-- it's not stopping.

</line>


<line>
Which is great!

</line>


<line>
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

</line>


<line>
H-2-Oh, no!

We are never talking

about any of this ever again. <name type="PERSON">Whew</name>.

</line>


<line>
So I will see you tomorrow.

We've got a rally in <name type="GPE">Bakersfield</name>

and then we're touring

a tennis ball factory in <name type="GPE">Modesto</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Hi.

</line>


<line>
You're the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
-I don't tell you that enough.

-It's okay.

</line>


<line>
If this governor thing

is really important to you...

</line>


<line>
It's not. You saw me in there.

I'm a terrible leader.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to be governor.

I just wanted people to like me.

</line>


<line>
Well, I like you.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, let's go home...

oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, thanks for inviting me

to your party.

</line>


<line>
I had a wonderful time.

-Ooh, haven't done <name type="NORP">Ethiopian</name> in a while.

</line>


<line>
I should go home.

I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.

</line>


<line>
He's probably worried about me.

</line>


<line>
I'm down for <name type="NORP">Ethiopian</name>.

I love that sponge bread.

</line>


<line>
-What do they call it, "injera"?

-Yeah, injera.

</line>


<line>
-Injera, right.

-That's right.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's good bread.
