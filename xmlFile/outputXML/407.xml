<line>

</line>


<line>
Whew.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack?

-I'm back in L.A.

</line>


<line>
-I should have called you--

-Yeah. You should have.

</line>


<line>
-I said I was sorry.

-No, you didn't.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.

-No--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
Okay, thank you.

</line>


<line>
What's going on here?

</line>


<line>
F<name type="ORG">un</name>draising dinner for the <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>

for <name type="GPE">California</name> campaign.

</line>


<line>
-All right, I'm just gonna--

-Sorry. It's a f<name type="ORG">un</name>draiser.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-BoJack!

</line>


<line>
I love your ironic take

on black-tie attire.

</line>


<line>
It really says,

"I truly don't care what you think of me."

</line>


<line>
This light bulb won't let me in

to your house without paying.

</line>


<line>
Ah, sorry about that.

Gotta raise those f<name type="ORG">un</name>ds.

</line>


<line>
-Can't I just--

-Thanks for your support, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Means so much. Erica!

-Hey--

</line>


<line>
Look at you,

with the right number of ears!

</line>


<line>
-Look, I just--

-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[growls]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...!

-[pops]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you have another bathroom?

They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

</line>


<line>
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

</line>


<line>
Because if I were pregnant, it would be

bad luck to tell you this early.

</line>


<line>
Presuming it was early.

But I'm not pregnant.

</line>


<line>
This is just a normal,

non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

</line>


<line>
-There's a bathroom in the pool house.

-You're a lifesaver.

</line>


<line>
Pardon me! Out of my way.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

</line>


<line>
Because you are looking

"gorges" this evening.

</line>


<line>
Well, I must be in <name type="NORP">Nazi</name> <name type="NORP">German</name>y,

because you're "not so" bad yourself.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, yours was better.

-[BoJack] Hi.

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[m<name type="ORG">un</name>ches]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, I should go.

</line>


<line>
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife

is talking to my other ex-wife.

</line>


<line>
-You have two ex-wives here?

-Katrina's his campaign manager.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>]</nonVerbComm> And Jessica Biel loves

getting photographed at fancy f<name type="ORG">un</name>draisers.

</line>


<line>
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,

in the same room! This is great.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-BoJack, I'm busy.

</line>


<line>
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, because you disapp--

No, I am not doing this now.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you get yourself a drink?

-I will get a drink.

</line>


<line>
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

Hi, Zach <name type="ORG">Braff</name>. Zach <name type="ORG">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey there. Famous actor Zach <name type="ORG">Braff</name>,

how you doing?

</line>


<line>
-[glass clinks]

-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna beat that sco<name type="ORG">un</name>drel

Woodchuck <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>...

</line>


<line>
Boo!

</line>


<line>
...and bring likability back to politics.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking

pals for being here tonight.

</line>


<line>
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"

but we did it anyway,

and it all worked out.

Love you, sweetie.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
Finally-- oh!

Sorry about that, folks.

</line>


<line>
I sensed an earthquake.

Must have been a false--

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey now!

</line>


<line>
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

</line>


<line>
Listen to me,

I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

</line>

<line>
-We're gonna die!

-Oh, fudge!

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

-I can't die!

</line>


<line>
I'm not famous enough yet to make

the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!

</line>


<line>
I have so many regrets!

</line>


<line>
I just picked up a family sitcom

where the mom is a zombie!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moans]</nonVerbComm>

It's called<ital> Mombie, </ital>and it's terrible!

</line>


<line>
I have a condition where every time

I sense a shift in power dynamics,

</line>


<line>
I have a tiny orgasm!

</line>


<line>
I have no original ideas,

I just repeat things I hear.

</line>


<line>
-I've never been in love!

-I've never been in love!

</line>


<line>
I tried gay at theater camp!

</line>


<line>
I regret <ital>everything!</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[voices overlapping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
Is anyone getting any bars?

I'm not getting any baa-rs.

</line>


<line>
Can someone validate my valet ticket?

I would like to go home now.

</line>


<line>
There's no way out.

Okay. Everybody stay sane.

</line>


<line>
I propose we set each other on fire

for warmth.

</line>


<line>
Who wants to be set on fire first?

Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, that's right.

</line>


<line>
The natives are getting restless,

</line>


<line>
so why don't you say something

to comfort them?

</line>


<line>
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

</line>


<line>
No one's going to light anyone on fire.

</line>


<line>
For one thing,

that'd eat up a lot of oxygen

and who knows

how much we have down here.

</line>


<line>
-[man] I want oxygen!

-[man screams] Air! I need air!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[guests screaming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
God.

</line>


<line>
-You okay, sweetie?

-I think so.

</line>


<line>
-That was really scary.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
At least we know no one

is specifically at fault.

</line>


<line>
Well, except for <name type="LOC">San Andreas</name>.

</line>


<line>
This was because you fracked

<name type="ORG">un</name>der our house.

</line>


<line>
I told you fracking was dangerous,

and you didn't listen.

</line>


<line>
And now our house is ruined

and we're trapped <name type="ORG">un</name>dergro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

and we're all going to die!

</line>


<line>
-Is this one of our sexy fights?

-[yells] No!

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

</line>


<line>
You can be mad at me or get dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

with me, but you can't do both.

</line>


<line>
Watch me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, what the shit?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[creaks, crashes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Oh, fish.

-[Todd] Uh... hello?

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing in there?

-Uh, I live here.

</line>


<line>
Didn't you know

there was a huge party going on?

</line>


<line>
I was going to go to the party

after my bath,

but then I realized

the bath <ital>was </ital>the party.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm not waiting aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

to be rescued like some chump.

</line>


<line>
Come on, let's go.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm> Whoa...!

</line>


<line>
-We gotta go in there?

-Well, I don't see any other way.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes life is like the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond season

of <ital>Friday Night Lights</ital>--

you gotta push through

and hope there's better stuff ahead.

</line>


<line>
Aw-ww!

</line>


<line>
Guys, let's all try to just stay cool

and make the best of things, huh?

</line>


<line>
"Make the best of things"? You idiot,

we're trapped and we're terrified.

</line>


<line>
Okay, settle down,

you future hard <ital><name type="ORG">Jeopardy</name></ital> question.

</line>


<line>
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.

</line>


<line>
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?

</line>


<line>
How are we supposed to make

the best of things?

</line>


<line>
-We're stuck <name type="ORG">un</name>dergro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

-This is true.

</line>


<line>
But most of us are important celebrities,

so someone will come for us soon.

</line>


<line>
And for you regulars,

I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!

</line>


<line>
What do we do till then?

</line>


<line>
We're actors! I say we put on a show.

Who's with me?

</line>


<line>
A show? Who will be the star?

Me, I assume.

</line>


<line>
Sure you'll be the star,

and you'll be the star!

</line>


<line>
And you'll be the star!

We'll all be the star!

</line>


<line>
Folks, I promise you

we will be out of here in no time.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And that's when I realized...

</line>


<line>
I just don't have the face for bangs.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

You're too kind! Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="ORG">Pho</name>ebe, for that rousing

<ital>Tale from <name type="FAC">the Above Gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</name>. </ital>Who's next?

</line>


<line>
I can't take this anymore.

I need to get out.

</line>


<line>
This is the longest I've gone

without moisturizing,

</line>


<line>
-and I feel like a lizard!

-Humph.

</line>


<line>
-No offense.

-It's only been 72 hours.

</line>


<line>
I'm missing my general meeting at <name type="ORG">CBS</name>.

I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

</line>


<line>
I can't live like this!

We've gotta light someone on fire.

</line>


<line>
I'm starting to think that less-famous

Michelle Monaghan has the right idea

</line>


<line>
-about lighting people on fire.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Come on, party people, keep it together.

Let's not forget why we're here--

to raise money for my campaign,

and more recently, to not go crazy

and murder each other.

</line>


<line>
Can someone please bring me my car?

It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

</line>


<line>
You're killing me, Zach.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>, you can do this.

</line>


<line>
Be the leader that I know you can be.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

</line>


<line>
-[bangs]

-What in the world?

</line>


<line>
<ital>"Vox clamantis in deserto."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-It is I.

-Woodchuck <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>!

</line>


<line>
-We're saved!

-Wow!

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank God. A leader.

</line>


<line>
-[Diane laughs]

-[BoJack] Sh.

</line>


<line>
What's going on down here?

Anyone's looking for us?

</line>


<line>
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

</line>


<line>
Diane, have you just been getting dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

with BoJack this whole time?

</line>


<line>
-What? I'm still mad at you.

-[BoJack laughing]

</line>


<line>
-Citizens, remain calm.

-Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

</line>


<line>
Rescue workers are coming

but it could be a while.

</line>


<line>
State emergency f<name type="ORG">un</name>ds have been depleted

due to budget overr<name type="ORG">un</name>s

on a costly bridge to <name type="GPE">Hawaii</name>

that's being constructed.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah!

</line>


<line>
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,

I came to get you out early.

</line>


<line>
Is that what a woodchuck is?

Why did I think it was like a beaver?

</line>


<line>
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?

Whole neighborhood totaled?

</line>


<line>
-Is the city in chaos?

-No, it's really just your house.

</line>


<line>
Because of all the fracking that's been

happening <name type="ORG">un</name>derneath your house.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Interesting!

</line>


<line>
-Ay-yi-yi.

-Oh, right, right.

</line>


<line>
So you just burrowed down here to rescue

your political opponent's top donors.

</line>


<line>
That's convenient.

</line>


<line>
It was actually very inconvenient,

but I put politics aside

to save you people from dying.

</line>


<line>
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm>

Hip, hip, hooray!

</line>


<line>
Please, don't cheer too loudly.

The t<name type="ORG">un</name>nel is very delicate.

</line>


<line>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-Seriously, I think it's best to--

</line>


<line>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-[rumbling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Let's cheer one more time, just for f<name type="ORG">un</name>!

-No, please.

</line>


<line>
-Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...

-Hooray!

</line>


<line>
-No!

-[rumbling]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screams]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So turns out three cheers was probably

an adequate number of cheers.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-Just keep walking.

</line>


<line>
God, I can't wait to get home.

</line>


<line>
I don't even have a home anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all

my different colored hats I never wear?

</line>


<line>
Well, if you need another couch

to crash on, there's always my place.

</line>


<line>
-Didn't you move in with Ralph?

-Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

</line>


<line>
-Just in case, I guess.

-In case of what?

</line>


<line>
-[faint chattering]

-What was that?

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[yelps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Now, ladies, just calm down.

We can talk about this.

</line>


<line>
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ants gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chattering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Did you say you're a princess?

</line>


<line>
-That's just my name. I'm a manager.

-It's like an agent.

</line>


<line>
-It's totally different.

-Is it, though?

</line>


<line>
-Silence! You negotiate deals?

-Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ant leader laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
My hands... they're crushed.

</line>


<line>
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

</line>


<line>
Well, I can dig!

</line>


<line>
Actually, no one should dig.

</line>


<line>
Your fo<name type="ORG">un</name>dation is basically <name type="NORP">Swiss</name> cheese.

</line>


<line>
The slightest provocation could cause

another collapse that would crush us all.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I know that because I bought a sitcom

about fracking, <ital>The Frack Shack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's <ital><name type="ORG">New Girl</name></ital> meets fracking.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch

that show, huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Someone will be coming for us soon.

In the meantime, we must organize.

</line>


<line>
Parcel out food and water

and see how much we've got.

</line>


<line>
-I'll assign team leaders.

-Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[guests chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right. Um...

</line>


<line>
-God...!

-For you, a banana

</line>


<line>
-because you're so appealing.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>, this is a disaster.

</line>


<line>
I don't think so.

I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

</line>


<line>
-And who made you the food captain?

-Woodchuck.

</line>


<line>
Exactly. He's in charge.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me,

you have not been allocated those rations.

</line>


<line>
I'm a horse. I need more food,

and I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
-Everyone down here is a celebrity.

-Not the caterers.

</line>


<line>
Relinquish the food.

</line>


<line>
Hey. Here's your chance.

</line>


<line>
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house

and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

</line>


<line>
This man has already reached

his allotted food portion for the day.

</line>


<line>
Who said we have to go by your rules?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, who made you leader

of <name type="ORG">un</name>dergro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

</line>


<line>
I'm just gonna take all this and...

</line>


<line>
You've appointed me.

Yes, I <name type="ORG">un</name>der-- citizens, look...

</line>


<line>
Keep it together.

[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-Weird stuff going on downstairs.

-[clicking]

</line>


<line>
Humph.

</line>


<line>
-I can't believe this is my life.

-Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
Too much sad booze for you.

Where's the happy booze?

</line>


<line>
I'm trapped <name type="ORG">un</name>dergro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

and it's all my husband's fault

and I'm gonna die in this mansion

in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But on the bright side--

</line>


<line>
Look, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> loves you,

you got a cool job, you got friends.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, you're right.

</line>


<line>
Even when I was above gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

I wasn't satisfied.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobbing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
What the...?

</line>


<line>
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

</line>


<line>
No. It...

</line>


<line>
I am! I'm a pit.

</line>


<line>
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

</line>


<line>
Diane, you're not a pit.

</line>


<line>
I'm a pit!

[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I can't believe I'm crying.

This is so dumb.

</line>


<line>
It's okay.

Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

</line>


<line>
You disappeared for a year and a half.

</line>


<line>
So you do want to talk about it.

Just took four solid days of drinking.

</line>


<line>
If you were back in L.A.,

why didn't you call me?

</line>


<line>
-I wasn't... ready.

-Ready? For what?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to be better

when you saw me again.

</line>


<line>
And I thought I could be, somehow.

But I'm not.

</line>


<line>
And even if I did get better,

the best I could ever be

is still just some other version of me.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.

</line>


<line>
I need you in my life.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-You're the biggest asshole I know,

and you're the only thing

that makes sense to me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane sighs, moans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
People should be able to have

some control over their lives down here.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

<line>
Leadership means

sometimes being the bad guy.

</line>


<line>
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

</line>


<line>
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

</line>


<line>
-That's not...

-That's a point for Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I'm the good guy,

so that's two points for me.

</line>


<line>
What points? There are no points.

</line>


<line>
-This is not a game!

-Well, maybe there should be points.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-Points!

</line>


<line>
People seem to like my points idea.

That's another point for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm the one who came down here

to save you in the first place.

</line>


<line>
Surely I get points for that.

</line>


<line>
Asking for points is conceited.

That's more points for me.

</line>


<line>
-He's right!

-What?!

</line>


<line>
If you came down to save us,

why are we still here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-That's right.

</line>


<line>
Minus point for Woodchuck.

</line>


<line>
I implore you not to fall

into a mob mentality.

</line>


<line>
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!

-Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy

is as broken as his hands.

</line>


<line>
That is a convincing argument.

He does have broken hands.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

</line>


<line>
An outsider like me,

the guy whose house this is.

Supposed to help her figure out

</line>


<line>
But I don't know where to start.

</line>


<line>
Did she try sending mutual consent form

to the adoption agency?

</line>


<line>
What, what words?

</line>


<line>
Well, if it's closed adoption,

you send a mutual consent form.

</line>

Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

If Mom says same thing,

boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

And also for a while,

</line>


<line>
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

</line>

We don't need to "get him."

Let's just tie him up someplace

Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.

<line>
-Where's the food?

-[Woodchuck] You ate all the food.

</line>


<line>
This is it!

</line>


<line>
Nobody's coming for us.

We need to kill someone for food.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...!

-Oh...!

</line>

Let's eat Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>!

</line>

Let's listen to the guy

He's got some interesting ideas.

</line>


<line>
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

</line>


<line>
I'm known for monologues

that sum things up at the end of the show.

</line>


<line>
I drive a Prius,

which means I'm a good person.

</line>


<line>
Let's not surrender

to our basest instincts.

</line>


<line>
I know times are tough,

but I'm sure if we band together

and really concentrate

on the problem at hand,

we can, as a group of friends--

[screams]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God.

-Biel!

</line>


<line>
The rule of man is over.

Now begins the rule of fire.

</line>

-[howls] Oh, why?

-Jessica, no.

</line>


<line>
I will no longer be shackled

by the civilized society

of the above gro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
This is <name type="FAC">Undergro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</name>,

and the only law here is flame.

</line>


<line>
The fire wants not for justice.

The fire wants not for reason.

</line>


<line>
-The fire desires only to be fed!

-Feed the fire!

</line>


<line>
-The fire is my new god!

-[moans] Oh, God!

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>,

but the tide has turned

and I side with the fire now.

</line>


<line>
Tonight, we dine on Zach <name type="ORG">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Tomorrow, canine cuisine!

-No.

</line>


<line>
You, take him to his spot,

and make him stay.

</line>


<line>

-No! No! Please!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulps]</nonVerbComm> Ah-hh!

I think that's all of it.

I can't go back to my old life sober.

Okay, okay.

Here's the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret to being happy.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

</line>


<line>
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually

you'll forget you're pretending.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you're right.

</line>


<line>
I just need to stop complaining

and work harder.

</line>


<line>
Everyone else is doing it.

Why am I so special?

but I fear by daybreak,

there will be no <name type="ORG">Braff</name> meat left.

-Four <name type="ORG">Non-Blondes</name>.

</line>

</line>


<line>
-[Diane] No!

-Easy on the merchandise!

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Well, it's been a tough week,

lots of back and forth,

but I think we've reached an agreement

that meets everybody's needs.

</line>


<line>
"The queen will share

male sex servants with the soldiers

for one night of magnificent,

sensuous splendor,

a gorgeous bacchanal

of hedonistic delights,

with a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond orgy pickup option,

pursuant on success of the first."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[hissing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

to the surface world?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I like this one.

She's smart.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I need water.

</line>

-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>, your time is nigh.

</line>


<line>
Any last words

before we light you on fire?

</line>


<line>
Yes, if I could just say,

"Don't light me on fire"?

</line>


<line>
The fire bends to no man's will.

Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane]</nonVerbComm> Water!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Jessica] What? [gasps]</nonVerbComm>

is really important to you...
