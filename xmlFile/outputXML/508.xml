Halloween. Fright Night.

Spook-tober 30-cursed!

</line>


<line>
Oh, there's the light switch.

I'm still getting used to this new <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
I just bought it and it's the '60s!

No, I'm just kidding!

</line>


<line>
It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume!

</line>


<line>
Groovy threads!

But you just got drafted, hippie!

</line>


<line>
-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>?

-Into the cutest husband army!

</line>


<line>
-[laughs, moans]

-Aw!

</line>


<line>
Where's your costume?

</line>


<line>
Can't I just wear a dumb hat

and say I'm Blossom?

</line>


<line>
In my opinionation... Yes.

</line>


<line>
I am so excited to go

to a real <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>wood party

with my husband the <name type="PERSON">T</name>V star.

</line>


<line>
Just do me a favor

and don't leave me alone, okay?

</line>


<line>
-Okay!

-Now hurry up and finish getting ready.

</line>


<line>
I'm kidding.

</line>


<line>
Can you imagine

if I spoke to you like that?

</line>


<line>
I really can't!

</line>


<line>
Next time, we're doing

a couples costume, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh!

</line>


<line>
It's the perfect way to tell the world

that you are completely on the same...

</line>


<line>
-<ital>paaaaage?</ital>

-What are you wearing?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught we were going

as <name type="PERSON">Rachel</name> Mc<name type="PERSON">Adam</name>s and <name type="PERSON">Ryan</name> Gosling

in the this-year 2004 hit film

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Notebook.</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ooοοοh</name>! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just said, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Notebook."</ital>

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be, like,

a pen or something.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he important thing is

we both look super-cute,

and everyone is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be, like,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, is that <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> Biel

from the upcoming<ital> <name type="PERSON">Blade</name>: <name type="PERSON">T</name>rinity?''</ital>

</line>


<line>
And I'll say my famous<ital> <name type="PERSON">Blade</name>: <name type="PERSON">T</name>rinity</ital>

catchphrase, "Stop goofin' aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d, <name type="PERSON">Blade</name>!"

</line>


<line>
Are you sure you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay

at this party?

</line>


<line>
Whenever I went with <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>,

we'd always end up in a big fight.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm not <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay. I just know you're afraid

of mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies.

</line>


<line>
And since it's Halloween,

we might see some mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies.

</line>


<line>
I'm not afraid of mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies.

</line>


<line>
I just don't like them

because of an incident...

from my past.

</line>


<line>
Will you stay on the lookout

and keep t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se creepy corpses away?

</line>


<line>
I'll be sure to make

a mental<ital> note</ital> of it!

</line>


<line>
I'm a notebook.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure I get our costumes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the guy from<ital> <name type="PERSON">T</name>he Hangover.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he first one, which just came out

this year. Why did I say "first one?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's only one<ital> Hangover</ital> movie,

and it's 2009.

</line>


<line>
-And you are...?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur Baby Bjorn <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>rg.

</line>


<line>
Famous '70s tennis player!

</line>


<line>
-And what's with the robot stuff?

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>rg. From<ital> Star <name type="PERSON">T</name>rek?</ital>

</line>


<line>
And you're also a baby?

</line>


<line>
In<ital> <name type="PERSON">T</name>he Hangover,</ital> the guy had a Baby Bjorn.

Baby Bjorn <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>rg.

</line>


<line>
-Seems like a lot of explaining.

-People will get it.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, we are going to have f<name type="ORG">un</name>

at this party!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be there?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. I'm so nervous.

</line>


<line>
I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to

with one of my ex-wives,

we'd get in a huge blow out.

</line>


<line>
I am so relieved that you are f<name type="ORG">un</name>

and easygoing,

</line>


<line>
-so there's no danger of that happening!

-Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
I love that we both love parties.

But more than that...

</line>


<line>
-I love you.

-Aw, I love you, too.

</line>


<line>
And I love these costumes!

</line>


<line>
But tell me one more time,

what are these costumes?

</line>


<line>
We're new social media app

</line>


<line>
It's Insta plus <name type="PERSON">Snapchat</name>...

which I guess was a thing in the '70s?

Pretending not to know your old friend

</line>


<line>
Why are you at my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
Remember when I invited you

to my Halloween party, and you said,

</line>


<line>
you'd love to come, but couldn't

</line>


<line>
because you were having

your own Halloween party?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sure my guests will s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up

any minute, so, you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld probably go.

</line>


<line>
Well, I figured,

"Hey, why not have a crossover party?"

</line>


<line>
So, I brought my party, wait for it,

to you!

<line>
At the end of last year's Halloween party,

you said, <name type="PERSON">"Let</name>'s do this a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in next year,"

</line>


<line>
like you've said at every Halloween party

So, we're having a party?

Why didn't you say this was happening?

</line>


<line>
Because I hate that it happens.

I take no action to make it happen.

</line>


<line>
Every year, I pray that it won't happen,

and it keeps happening anyway!

</line>

I feel like an idiot being

at a Halloween party wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut a costume.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> cares? I don't have a costume.

-Uh, you're wearing a costume.

</line>


<line>
Do you mean, in the sense

that we all wear costumes,

such as we reveal facets of ourselves

to t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se closest to us,

but our truest selves remain hidden?

</line>


<line>
No, in the sense

that you are literally wearing a costume

</line>


<line>
-from the <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w we both work on.

-Oh, yeah!

</line>


<line>
I'll go to <name type="ORG">Rite Aid</name> to see

what I can arrange.

</line>


<line>
Don't let the party end

before I get back.

</line>

I definitely will let it die down!

and then something

really traumatic happened.

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, what?

-I, uh... I didn't get the part.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's it? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just didn't get it?

<line>
I really wanted it!

And it still ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ts me!

as of 2004,

so could you please do me

this one thing

and make sure I don't see any mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies?

</line>

I promise. No mu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ies.

-I cannot keep track.

-Well, don't forget about <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, huh?

</line>


<line>
Uh, what? Why is the waitress here

talking about pickles?

</line>


<line>
Somebody order pickles?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, this is my girlfriend.

Her name is <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can remember

because if you look at me,

and don't recall my name, you'll think,

<name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> is this person?

I'm in a real pickle!"

<line>
And then just know that my name

It really makes me feel

like one of the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ng.

</line>


<line>
If he teases you, that means he likes you.

</line>


<line>
What? Is that what people think

when I tease them?

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Cool.

</line>


<line>
Remember the year

that <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name> won the costume contest,

but then it turned out he'd just lost

all his belongings in a fire,

and t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se clothes were all that he owned?

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

-[gulps] <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was classic!

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, I gotta go r<name type="ORG">un</name>

the costume contest.

</line>


<line>
Ow! My back! Why'd I do that?

</line>


<line>
It so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like

you all have a lot of history.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I can't believe

we've been doing this party since '93.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the year I was born!

-I... did not realize that!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Hey, cheers!

</line>


<line>
-[gulps]

-[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane sighs]

</line>


<line>
Are you having f<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining

my costume to people over and over a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Hey, here's a t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught:

if you don't get someone's costume,

you don't need to tell them!

Just live your life!

</line>


<line>
-Do you wanna leave?

-No, no, no, no! I'm f<name type="ORG">un</name>!

</line>


<line>
I don't want to leave! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I wanna leave!

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has the yellow military

assault vehicle blocking me in?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, that's me!

-Since when do you drive a <name type="PERSON">Hu</name><name type="PERSON">mm</name>er?

</line>


<line>
Company car.

I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.

</line>


<line>
Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs,

and, boy, does that kitten purr.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you take her out for a spin

and see <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w she handles?

</line>


<line>
What is his costume?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>! Hi!

-Hey...

</line>


<line>
Am I on the hit <name type="PERSON">Priscilla Barnes</name> vehicle

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>hree's Company</ital> right now,

because three's company.

</line>


<line>
-I'm just trying to get out of here.

-Oh, my gosh, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

</line>


<line>
I just want you to know that I know

that you and Mister have a history...

</line>


<line>
-"Mister?"

-And I'm fine with it,

and there's no reason we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be awkward

aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d each other, or jealous, you know?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not jealous of you.

-Okay, good.

</line>


<line>
I'm not jealous of you either,

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh you are really intimidating.

</line>


<line>
But if we were jealous of each other,

that would be very normal,

so either way, it's totally cool.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally cool. [hiccups]

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we do s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ts together

to, like, celebrate

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w normal we're being?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, this is a good situation.

</line>


<line>
Okay, bye, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I screw up? I'm so stupid.

-No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
She doesn't like parties

and she hates f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-No, that's not fair. She used to be f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
In fact, when we first started dating,

my favorite thing about her was

that she was so much more f<name type="ORG">un</name>

than my other ex-wives.

</line>


<line>
Oh, we're talking about your exes a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's great.

</line>


<line>
Of course, <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> used to be f<name type="ORG">un</name>, too.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why I started seeing her

after <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>

because <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name> was so mean and cynical,

and <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name> was sweet and full of life.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, she so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds awesome.

</line>


<line>
But, actually, now that I think about it,

when I first met <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>,

she was also full of life.

</line>


<line>
Do you want another drink?

I'm going to get another drink.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. What a weird coincidence.

</line>


<line>
Why do all these idealistic,

vivacious women eventually turn bitter

and cruel after being with me?

What's the co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on denominator?

</line>


<line>
-[guests chattering]

-[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Ugh. [sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, buddy.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="GPE">con<name type="PERSON">ga</name></name> line leader

accidentally led us right into the pool.

</line>


<line>
I've never felt so alive!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld've been there!

-I want to go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me now.

</line>


<line>
-What? But this party is so f<name type="ORG">un</name>!

-It's not f<name type="ORG">un</name> for me.

</line>


<line>
'Cause I don't know anyone here.

</line>


<line>
Of course you do. Just-- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u remember my wife <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h? No, I do not.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is going great.

</line>


<line>
-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go dry off. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u two chat it up.

-No, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, please.

</line>


<line>
So f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What's the story on the hat?

-It's a Blossom costume.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.

I need a costume! <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d call, stranger!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
So, I love parties, as you know,

but maybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go soon?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here are so many famous people here,

it's actually making me kind of anxious.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane! Famous people are just

like you and me.

</line>


<line>
Well, like me, because I am one.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m? No, I can't talk right now.

Can I call you tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
Or is this the one night a year

you emerge from your crypt?

</line>


<line>
Go introduce yourself.

I'm sure he'd love to meet you!

</line>


<line>
-Or we could just go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

-No, come on.

</line>


<line>
It's Halloween,

a night to face your fears.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why they call it Halloween!

</line>


<line>
So, you can wean yourself off

of having fears!

</line>


<line>
Say<ital> "Hallo"</ital> to weaning!

by a blue <name type="PERSON">T</name>esla.

</line>


<line>
I'm looking for the owner of a blue <name type="PERSON">T</name>esla.

</line>


<line>
Studies say buying used is actually better

for the environment,

but, hey, you tried,

and subsequently trapped me at this party!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Oh.

Hey, listen. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat submarine scene...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna talk about it?

</line>


<line>
-No?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
We'll just put that in the large bucket

of things we don't talk about.

</line>


<line>
-What is that supposed to mean?

<line>
Hey, doorman! I don't have a costume.

</line>


<line>
And I don't wanna look stupid

at my own bitchin' Halloween party.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I've got an idea.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a one-night stand.

Get it? Nightstand?

</line>


<line>
Nice! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be a producer

or something.

</line>


<line>
-Ha, ha. Yeah, right!

-[doorbell neighs]

</line>


<line>
-But not yet. Keep manning the door.

-[sighs] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Ah! All dry! Sorry,

I got a little distracted on the way back

by some people with a <name type="NORP">Ouija</name> board.

</line>


<line>
A dead soul told me to "AERXIXFASP"!

</line>


<line>
-What could it mean?

-Cool.

</line>


<line>
While you were gone,

<name type="PERSON">Ben Stein</name> introduced me to <name type="PERSON">T</name>im Allen,

and the three of us had a long debate

about government spending,

which is exactly

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I wanted to spend my Halloween.

</line>


<line>
-I am so sorry.

-Alt<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, I have to say,

now that your <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w has put us

into a new tax bracket,

maybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld start

paying attention more

to <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w the government is using our money.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-No, I don't know, ya know,

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying

that a true capitalist-free market

is actually, if you really think about it,

more fair than an arbitrary redistribution

based on need.

that argument a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I really humiliated myself

in front of <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[engine]

-If it makes you feel better,

</line>


<line>
I guarantee <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> won't even remember

that he met you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
Okay, new strategy.

</line>


<line>
I'm looking for four

strong construction workers

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can lift my car

and carry it out to the street,

like in the <name type="PERSON">Mentos</name> co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial.

Any takers?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Open the door!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Just leave me alone!

</line>


<line>
What's going on in there?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ough SA<name type="PERSON">T</name> prep course?

</line>


<line>
Fail her learner's permit test?

</line>


<line>
Skirmish with the members

of the <ital>Baby-Sitter's Club?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Nope.

-Shattered dreams of playing <name type="GPE">Adelaide</name>

in her high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol's production

of<ital> <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s and Dolls</ital>

because the musical director sees her

as more of a <name type="PERSON">Rusty</name> <name type="PERSON">Char</name>lie?

</line>


<line>
I don't know why this keeps happening.

</line>


<line>
I take these amazing women,

like <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, like you,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>, <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name>, and I ruin them.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I'm not <ital>ruined.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No, I just mean... I don't listen.

-Okay, yes.

</line>


<line>
It is definitely very annoying

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you don't listen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, but you don't have to say

nice things just to make me feel better.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h? Okay, no.

</line>


<line>
I was going to say you not listening

and I repeat, you don't listen,

</line>


<line>
-that's not the only thing going on here.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here are more things?

</line>


<line>
-What do all these women have in co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're mean?

</line>


<line>
-When you first start dating them.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're f<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u keep dating women in their 20s.

</line>


<line>
I do, do that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're not fully-formed yet.

Life changes people.

</line>


<line>
-Well, not me.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's kind of my point.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't ruin these women,

they just grow up.

</line>


<line>
So, what you're saying is...

they all grow up, but I stay the same age?

</line>


<line>
All right. All right. All right.

How do I fix that?

</line>


<line>
Well, either you date someone older...

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Ooooooor...</ital>

-Or, you grow up.

</line>


<line>
Because otherwise,

they're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> keep outgrowing you.

</line>


<line>
Mind if I try?

</line>


<line>
Okay, first thing we need to do

is sit you up and get you hydrated.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks.

</line>


<line>
I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand what you're going through.

</line>


<line>
I've been in your position before,

and this party is hard.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[hiccups]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> It is!

</line>


<line>
It's hard to be the new girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
And to be at a famous person's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

at an event with 25 years of history,

and all these people

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter has known for years.

</line>


<line>
-[hiccups] Plus, you're here.

-Plus, I'm here.

</line>


<line>
-What if I'm just a rebo<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

-Mm.

</line>


<line>
I was a rebo<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

And he loved me, so much, for ten years.

</line>


<line>
If there's one thing I know

about him,

it's that he loves the person he's with

deeply and <name type="ORG">un</name>conditionally.

</line>


<line>
So, you don't have to worry about me,

because I'm not that person anymore.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are.

-Aw. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-[door opens]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> sighs]

-If you guys will excuse me,

</line>


<line>
I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take

this dick<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le's helicopter <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
-Are you okay?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'm actually really glad you went through

all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se ex-wives

because it means

I got the best version of you.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right. Version 4.0.

-Oh! I like the so<name type="ORG">un</name>d of that.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you wanna just go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

Hang out, just the two of us?

</line>


<line>
Psh! No way! I just saw on <name type="PERSON">T</name>weed Feed

that <name type="GPE">Jose</name>phine's ex, <name type="PERSON">T</name>or,

is throwing a monster shindig up in <name type="GPE">NoHo</name>.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>-sephine's ex-what now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey have a two-story ice luge,

and a huge beer pond tournament.

</line>


<line>
And I brought new costumes,

so we don't have to look stupid wearing

the same in all our pictures.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I never wanna grow up!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Where's everybody going?

It's Halloween!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groaning]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[door opens]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Happy Hallowee-- What the?

</line>


<line>
-Where is everyone?

-Hey, let's do this a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in next year.

</line>
