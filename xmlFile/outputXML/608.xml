</line>


<line>
A hu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ingbird smiled at me

on my walk this morning.

</line>


<line>
In small pleasures such as this,

I'm reminded of the presence of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd.

</line>


<line>
-As you ought.

-And yet...

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Out with it, Sister <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rguerite.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o hesitate is to waste time,

which is a sin when time

could be elsewise spent in prayer,

or handwashing <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nsignor <name type="PERSON">T</name>oscani's

1962 <name type="ORG">Alfa <name type="PERSON">Romeo</name></name>,

which is itself a form of prayer,

is it not?

</line>


<line>
Of course. Yet I find myself consumed

by t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughts of my past.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have no past. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've confessed.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur sins have been washed clean.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is like day one stuff,

what are we talking about here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he people I've hurt,

the lives I've ruined,

are they washed clean as well?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur regrets are of no benefit

to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ruminating</name> so is a solipsism <name type="ORG">un</name>befitting

a sister of the cloth.

</line>


<line>
Is it solipsism to be concerned

with the fates of others?

</line>


<line>
Perhaps one could argue

cloistering oneself from the world

is itself a form of solipsism.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> If one were being <name type="ORG">un</name>generous.

</line>


<line>
Remember when you first arrived here

and you didn't talk for like two years?

</line>


<line>
I will trouble you no further, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ther.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you challenge me

with so ve<name type="GPE">xin</name>g a pupil.

</line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> What dereliction is this?!

</line>


<line>
When you get to Heaven,

look up <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rgo <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rtindale!

</line>


<line>
I won't be there, but my movies will!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I wanna know what's changed

since the strike.

</line>


<line>
Are assistants treated better or have

things reverted to business as usual?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, give me ten inches.

I also want a roast beef sub.

</line>


<line>
-Six inches.

-[intercom beeps]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-[woman</name>] <ital><name type="PERSON">Paige</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name> is on her way up.</ital>

-Ah, shit.

</line>


<line>
She's the best reporter

this building's ever seen,

but, goddamn,

is that woman a pain in the ass.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Paige</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Colleagues!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur eyes do not deceive!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u may find my gown overly formal

for the workplace,

but that is because I am, as of today

formerly a member

of this vaulted institution.

</line>


<line>
As I'm to be wed tonight

and the newsroom is no room

for a domesticated woman,

</line>


<line>
-I bid you farewell.

-[man screams]

</line>


<line>
Okay, goodbye.

</line>


<line>
Yes, mine was a storied r<name type="ORG">un</name>

as the star reporter for "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Reporter."

</line>


<line>
"Front Page <name type="PERSON">Paige</name>," they called me!

</line>


<line>
-Well, we'll miss you, <name type="PERSON">Paige</name>.

-Indeed.

</line>


<line>
My s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>es don't fill easy,

my left foot striking a more robust

sil<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uette than her starboard sister.

</line>


<line>
But I cannot prolong my en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>gement.

</line>


<line>
After all, time, as they say,

is a river wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut banks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ime may not have banks,

but this periodical certainly does.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ximillian <name type="PERSON">Banks</name>, at my service!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[scoffs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ximilian <name type="PERSON">Banks</name>.

</line>


<line>
I may lack your nose for news,

but I've got an eyeball for a highball!

</line>


<line>
Why, this man couldn't

string together two clauses

</line>


<line>
wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut ending on a preposition.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're referring to.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u could fill a library

with all the things you don't know.

</line>


<line>
In fact, they do.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey call them libraries.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s, we're trying to work here.

</line>


<line>
No matter, I shan't be staying.

</line>


<line>
My sweet betrothed, <name type="PERSON">Baxter</name> <name type="PERSON">Bella</name>my,

awaits with champagne

to chauffeur me directly to my nuptials,

</line>


<line>
and I didn't think I'd visit long,

</line>


<line>
so I left him in the car

with the windows up. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d, I've got business

to attend to as well.

</line>


<line>
I'll have you know it's almost time

for my mid-morning confabulation

</line>


<line>
with a former stage mother to the stars,

Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Carol</name> Hi<name type="PERSON">mm</name>elfarb-Richardson.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been taking t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne calls?!

</line>


<line>
Yes, she is as loony as a <name type="NORP">Canadian</name> dollar,

</line>


<line>
but she is a scintillating

conversationalist.

</line>


<line>
Oh? What about the conversation 

scintillates?

</line>


<line>
She calls every day to see if we have

any information on her dead daughter.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he answer's always no.

-So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like a scoop.

</line>


<line>
It's not. It's a pop star w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> overdosed.

Open-and-shut case.

</line>


<line>
-All the better for opening and shutting.

-Why do you have that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>, my boy,

my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom,

</line>


<line>
best put the champagne on ice.

</line>


<line>
I've got a story that simply <name type="NORP">dem</name>ands

my attention

and I just couldn't marry you

before it's settled.

</line>


<line>
I'd only be distracted,

which isn't fair to you or me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, darling, I've already co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>itted

to being your wife.

</line>


<line>
What, you need to hear a few measly words?

</line>


<line>
Well, "I do." Does that satisfy?

</line>


<line>
I do, I do, I do,

</line>


<line>
and I do want you

to wait for me to ring you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rtly.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[snorts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I knew you'd <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Mm! [snorts]

</line>


<line>
Now, as to the girl.

I smell beans. Spill 'em.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he girl's name was Sharon <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you ever notice that this music video

takes place in a planetarium,

</line>


<line>
-and <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> died in a planetarium?

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
-Uh... Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>awnie.

-[music stops]

</line>


<line>
Are we going to this party?

</line>


<line>
I didn't come all the way down

to <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>nhattan

to just watch you watch your boyfriend

be on the internet

at his parents' fancy <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Don't parent-shame him, <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

</line>


<line>
It's not <name type="PERSON">T</name>rey's fault he grew up

in an <name type="LOC">Upper Westside</name> brownstone.

</line>


<line>
Also, I'm not her boyfriend.

We're <name type="ORG">un</name>complicated like that.

</line>


<line>
Come on! We're missing the party.

</line>


<line>
What? No. If we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up before 2:00,

everyone's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> think we're losers.

</line>


<line>
Fine. But can't we do something else

while we wait? [<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]

</line>


<line>
Let's explore the city!

</line>


<line>

<name type="NORP">-[siren</name> wailing]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Big Apple.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here she is.

</line>


<line>
Apparently, there's a bar aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d here

called Harti<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n's.

</line>


<line>
My cousin and his friends call it

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey-Don't-<name type="PERSON">Cardi<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n</name>'s." I don't get it.

</line>


<line>
Wow, a real <name type="GPE">New <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>rk</name> bar.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat could be cool.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, a bar! But <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w often are we

in <name type="GPE">New <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>rk</name>?

</line>


<line>
Let's go to the top

of <name type="GPE">the Empire State Building</name>,

like the big ape

in that movie, <ital>Sleepless in <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right! Big building!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[th<name type="ORG">un</name>der rumbling]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, we thank <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u for this bo<name type="ORG">un</name>ty-- <name type="PERSON">Ella</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat place you sent me didn't fix me.

</line>


<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy.

</line>


<line>
Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blasted

chicken fingers from Chicken-4-<name type="PERSON">Dayz</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not staying. I'm going to a place

where the people accept me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sit your ass in that chair, <name type="PERSON">Ella</name>,

because that place is right here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I wish I'd said.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen <name type="PERSON">Ella</name> in four years,

but every night I bring <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me dinner,

</line>


<line>
I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted

chicken fingers just for her,

so that if she ever comes <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me...

</line>


<line>
<ital>she'll know that she's welcome</ital>

<ital>at our table.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> Jannings,

our little indie film darling,

</line>


<line>
I think I speak for both of us

when I say <name type="PERSON">gooba</name>, <name type="PERSON">gooba</name>, hey, yah, yah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ears. Feel my cheeks.

Damp cheeks over here.

</line>


<line>
I do notice it's not

as Chicken-4-<name type="PERSON">Dayz</name>-focused

as maybe it seemed in the outline stage?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>alk us through your journey there.

</line>


<line>
What do you want?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want a close-up of the bucket?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I think that would make it

feel like a co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial,

and what's so innovative

about this content

is that it's not a co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial.

</line>


<line>
Right, I forgot about the innovative part

of it. Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Our target <name type="NORP">dem</name>o responds poorly

when they feel

they're being advertised to,

but they love stories that en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ge them

on their level,

utilizing themes of inclusivity,

as well as d<name type="ORG">un</name>king on the olds.

</line>


<line>
Ah, yes, teens love d<name type="ORG">un</name>king on olds,

is there any way to get more of that in?

</line>


<line>
-Well, we already s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t the ad.

-Not an ad.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he i<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ersive product placement journey.

</line>


<line>
But maybe I can find takes

that are in more of a d<name type="ORG">un</name>king tone,

as well as s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ts

that highlight more prominently

but do not feature the bucket

of chicken-bacon finger-blasters.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for letting us help you share

your beautiful vision with the world.

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

<line>
A gig's a gig.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">Vassar</name> doesn't accept indie cred

in lieu of my daughter's tuition.

</line>


<line>
I just don't believe it.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a way better director than I am.

you'd be doing chicken co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercials--

this one set in the world

of competitive ballroom dancing,

working title, "Balls to the Wall,"

if you'd told me that...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u'd be super-stoked?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,

but then eventually,

I would get aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d to being outraged.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
It is f<name type="ORG">un</name> that we're both working

<line>
-Right?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
What are these new pages?

Why do I have new pages?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't like the new pages?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>he content of the pages

is not the issue, <name type="ORG">Justin</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-I spent time preparing the other pages.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand?

</line>


<line>
I rehearsed them. I studied them.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's precious time I'll never get back!

</line>


<line>
And then some person--

I don't know this person--

</line>


<line>
And by the way, I don't like strange

persons knocking on my door

and then letting themselves in.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he knock is so I can tell you to enter.

</line>


<line>
If you just enter,

 what is the purpose of the knock?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right, of course.

</line>


<line>
My point is about the pages.

Why are you throwing new things at me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he insurance guys are ni<name type="GPE">xin</name>g

the car chase.

</line>


<line>
We had to think fast, so we put together

a new hand-to-hand combat scene

we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> throw on top

of the meringue number.

</line>


<line>
-So, it's a st<name type="ORG">un</name>t?

-I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you'd be excited.

</line>


<line>
I'm excited!

It's more time spent on your face.

</line>


<line>
Ever since I directed you in that episode

of "<name type="ORG">FBI</name>: Female <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>dy Inspectors,"

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught... [chuckles]

"I gotta give this woman her close-up."

</line>


<line>
Don't produce me, <name type="ORG">Justin</name>.

</line>

I didn't mean to bite your head off.

</line>


<line>
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally my fault.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld've warned you.

</line>


<line>
Is there something else going on

that I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld know about?

</line>


<line>
I'm fine. I'm actually being

really cool here.

</line>


<line>
I'm not some kind of monster

just because I don't like surprises.

</line>


<line>
I'm number one on the call sheet.

I'm entitled to a little respect.

</line>


<line>
No, you're right.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I've worked on projects

where the number one on the call sheet

was like an actual crazy person,

so I think I'm being really cool.

</line>


<line>

-Yeah?

compare yourself to <name type="ORG">Justin</name> Kenyon.

</line>


<line>
-What's the difference?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a joke,

but I see you're in no mood.

</line>


<line>
I'm a good director.

</line>


<line>
Yes, but <name type="ORG">Justin</name>'s movies

make actual money.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last big movie you were on,

you got fired off of.

</line>


<line>
Explain this to me.

</line>


<line>
I didn't break

into the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> Library alone

and yet I'm the only one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se career has suffered.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think that is?

</line>


<line>
Kelse, I don't know by what fancy

the fates push us about

in their great cosmic dance.

</line>


<line>
-I am but an agent.

-What about these stories I keep hearing

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w people wanna hire

more female directors?

</line>


<line>
Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.

Just not for this particular project.

</line>


<line>
Which particular project?

</line>


<line>
Anyone. I mean, you name it.

Whatever <name type="PERSON">Paul Feig's</name> doing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get me out of director jail.

</line>


<line>
Even <name type="PERSON">Roman</name> Polanski works more than I do,

and he s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be in actual jail.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Yeah, for his last

couple of movies, at least, right? Woof!

</line>


<line>
No. Not for his last couple of movies.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>, be a doll and tell this dame

what you told me.

</line>


<line>
I just don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why my daughter would start using a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
She was sober.

She was going to <name type="ORG">AA</name> meetings.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u suspect foul play?

</line>


<line>
Listen to this,

the last voicemail I ever got from her,

</line>


<line>
-a month before she died.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Hey, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name><name type="PERSON">mm</name>y.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I got out of a meeting

and we're making amends,

so I just wanted to say I'm sorry

I'm such a disappointment. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed

with the chic minimalism

of your new <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name> room.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you

as my older sister

when we met <name type="PERSON">David</name> Hassel<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ff

at the Kids' C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice Awards.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I've never been

enough for you, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name><name type="PERSON">mm</name>y!

</line>


<line>
What an angel.

She just wanted me to be happy.

</line>


<line>
What is the "we"?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Yeah! At the beginning.

</line>


<line>
She says, "We're making amends."

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s this "we"?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[camera shutter clicking]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, we don't have to go

to this party if you don't want to.

</line>


<line>
What? I'm the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> keeps saying,

<name type="PERSON">"Let</name>'s go to the party."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only reason I came down here was so

we could go to this party and get dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

</line>


<line>
Come on. I've gone to like

a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred parties with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u always say you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> drink,

and you never do, which is fine,

by the way!

</line>


<line>
No one's ever offered me a drink.

</line>


<line>
I keep waiting

for this famous peer pressure

</line>


<line>
I've heard so much about

and it never happens!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna go have a drink? Here I am,

your peer, pressuring you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I'm nervous about losing control,

you know?

</line>


<line>
I think drinking alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l

might not be for you.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna be scared of something

that's supposed to be f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why I wanna go to that party

with a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of strangers.

</line>


<line>
Because if I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> lose control, I don't

want it to be in front of people I know.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, weirdo.

-[chuckles] <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a weirdo.

</line>


<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy.

</line>


<line>
Do you think we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld ADR her saying

"<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy-o"? Is "<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>dy-o" more of a d<name type="ORG">un</name>k?

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-[cell p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne rings]

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Um, hello?

</line>


<line>
Am I speaking

to the future director of "Fireflame"?!

</line>


<line>
-What's that?

-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Another one?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but the difference is this one's

about a lady superhero,

which means this one you could

actually get hired on!

</line>


<line>
I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a woman.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think <name type="ORG">Justin</name> Kenyon says,

</line>


<line>
"I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a man"?

</line>


<line>
Of course not! He says, "<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ney,

money, money. Nom, nom, nom."

</line>


<line>
I have heard him say that.

</line>


<line>
Besides, they don't want this

to be just another superhero movie.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're looking for someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> can make

a superhero movie with a twist!

</line>


<line>
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?

</line>


<line>
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
But they do wanna hear your take,

by which I mean they want you,

as a woman, to tell them their take.

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[man]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I've been saying for years

as soon as we r<name type="ORG">un</name> out

of popular male characters

and we've given them each two sequels,

we have to make a movie about Fireflame!

</line>


<line>
I think that's really edgy

and outside the box.

</line>


<line>
Outside is exactly where we're trying

to be, in relation to the box.

</line>


<line>
We really think Fireflame can connect

with today's <name type="PERSON">Yas Queen</name> culture.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I got a real <name type="PERSON">Yas Queen</name> vibe

from her.

</line>


<line>
She comes in, she saves the day,

everyone loves her!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>dn't I tell you this would make

a great movie?

</line>


<line>
Uh, pretty sure I told you, <name type="PERSON">Nancy</name>.

I have always loved Fireflame.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I remember now,

you did tell me that.

</line>


<line>
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.

</line>


<line>
We're obviously <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> hear a lot of takes,

but it seems like you have

a special connection to the material.

</line>


<line>
I do.

I can get a glass with an olive in it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ry to stay on task, won't you, <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>xy?

</line>


<line>
If <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> was going to meetings here,

someone must have seen her,

and if someone saw something,

then I wanna know it,

particularly as it pertains--

</line>


<line>
What crime have I co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>itted

to deserve so long a sentence?

</line>


<line>
I've got a point.

</line>


<line>
Once you arrived at it,

send me a postcard.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he starlet was alone

when she died, right?

</line>


<line>
But there was someone else

with her while she was blotto.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was that person? What'd they see?

</line>


<line>
And why weren't they mentioned

in the police report?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's your w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>, what and why.

</line>


<line>
Get a when and a where in there,

and we've got ourselves a story.

</line>


<line>
Bully for you, you're almost caught up

to where I was an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur ago.

</line>


<line>
Let's chat a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in in an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur

when you've gotten to where I'm at now.

</line>


<line>
So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds good.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime, someone in this building

might just offer the key

that opens the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>te to the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rden

with the tree that bears the fruit

that is our scoop.

</line>


<line>
Get someone to squeal on an <name type="ORG">AA</name> meeting?

</line>


<line>
I do believe one "A"

of the two stands for "anonymous."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he other "A",

I could not possibly fat<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m.

</line>


<line>
I envy your faith in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor

and discretion of other people.

</line>


<line>
Let's see <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w that <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor stacks up

a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst the desire

to dish on celebrities

so as to appear swank by association.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, kind stranger.

I'm writing a story

</line>


<line>
-on the efficacy of your program.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand one of the pillars

is anonymity, but if you could...

</line>


<line>
I once saw <name type="PERSON">Craig <name type="PERSON">Fergus</name>on</name> here!

I don't know why I said that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Oh.

</line>


<line>
I really s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't say. It's anonymous,

but I have seen <name type="PERSON">Ro<name type="PERSON">bert</name> Downey</name>, Jr.

</line>


<line>
Jamie <name type="PERSON">Lee</name> Curtis winked at me once.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Colin Farrell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Russell Brand</name>,

the <name type="PERSON">Ike</name>a <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nkey.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name></name>, I've seen.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
About a month before she died.

It was pretty clear she was using.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you figure?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d she say something?

</line>


<line>
She didn't, but her friend did.

</line>


<line>
-Her friend?

-Large fella.

</line>


<line>
I think he was a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse

or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.

</line>


<line>
Kind of like a ro<name type="ORG">un</name>der <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> Garrett type,

but with a very forgettable face.

</line>


<line>
He told a story, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, I remember that.

</line>


<line>
It was about a trip he took to...

<name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is so long ago now.

</line>


<line>
I think he had sex with the girl,

or maybe he had sex with the mother?

</line>


<line>
Well, do get your story sorted,

but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.

</line>


<line>
And this man left with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Do you recall anything else

about this man, his name, perhaps?

</line>


<line>
No, but I remember the girl's name.

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

now we're all up to speed.

</line>


<line>
No, the girl from his story.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
He was weirdly proud of it,

said her name was <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y <name type="PERSON">Carson</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Carson</name>, eh?

</line>


<line>
"<name type="ORG">Penn</name>y <name type="PERSON">Carson</name>," he said. <name type="PERSON">"And</name> that's

her real name, you can look her up!"

</line>


<line>
I remember thinking,

"Why does he want us to look her up?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
So she's sexy,

but don't you call her sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
-[laughs] <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>y.

-Oh, that is so Fireflame.

</line>


<line>
-[yelps]

-Oh, wow!

</line>


<line>
-Stop!

-What?

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, I can't let you--

-Uh, excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Are you already-- Sorry.

I'm sure she's got a great pitch,

but the movie you want,

it's just not realistic.

</line>


<line>
Sure it is.

<name type="ORG">Wendy</name> Wiggum ate fire as a baby

and now she <name type="PERSON">ho</name>lds the power

of the Fireflame. It's all very logical.

</line>


<line>
No, I just mean you're doing this

all wrong.

</line>


<line>
She saves the day,

and everybody loves her?

</line>


<line>
I mean, yeah, that makes sense

if she's a man.

</line>


<line>
But it's never worked like that for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, this isn't about you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right! It's about an exotic dancer

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s also interdimensional.

</line>


<line>
No. I mean the rules are different

for women.

</line>


<line>
If you're a woman

and you save the day, nobody loves you.

</line>


<line>
People take you for granted,

or worse, they resent you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey p<name type="ORG">un</name>ish you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he more powerful you are,

the more they'll take your power away.

</line>


<line>
And I just think if your movie is smart,

you'll acknowledge that.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, yeah, so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like a bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er.

-Yeah, it's a bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er.

</line>


<line>
Being a superhero is hard.

Otherwise, everyone would do it.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, thank you for--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe that is a bad superhero movie.

Not aspirational enough, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
But it's real. And it's different.

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a!

</line>


<line>
Well, we're here.

</line>


<line>
So I wanted to talk to you because

I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"!

</line>


<line>
"Fireflame"? Get that money.

Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

</line>


<line>
Yeah. So I need an actress.

Someone tough, but vulnerable.

</line>


<line>
I know you're working with <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> <name type="PERSON">Cazador</name>.

What do you think of her?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, if you've seen her work,

you know what she can do.

</line>


<line>
She's very versatile. Really talented.

</line>


<line>
But personality-wise, what's she like?

Is she good to work with?

</line>


<line>
I can't risk any drama on set.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's too much riding on this for me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> If I'm being <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest,

I can't reco<name type="PERSON">mm</name>end her.

</line>


<line>
-No?

-Especially if you have a lot of st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts.

</line>


<line>
I mean, don't get me wrong,

she's great on camera. She just...

</line>


<line>
-Uh... She can be a little difficult.

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what happened.

</line>


<line>
I worked with her a couple years ago,

she was great, but, um...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[inhales sharply]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'d be perfect?

<name type="ORG">Court</name>ney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>!

</line>


<line>
Oh! I love her.

</line>


<line>
I've heard nothing but good things.

</line>

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[coughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
It's fine.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not even supposed to like it yet.

</line>


<line>
It tastes okay-er over time.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er

over time myself.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I actually didn't even drink

for like all of college.

</line>


<line>
I had some shit go down

in high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol, and...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, there was this girl in my town.

Anyway, it's a long story.

</line>


<line>
No, I wanna hear it.

</line>


<line>
Okay. She had this man

living in her <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean like more than one dad?

</line>


<line>
No, no, she had just the one dad,

but then there was this other guy.

</line>


<line>
-Weird.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally weird, right?

</line>


<line>
Okay. So this girl was best friends

with my girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
We all went to prom together:

me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.

</line>


<line>
Wait, the man went to prom with you?

Yeesh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not even the yeesh-iest part.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his guy bought us bourbon

and practically forced us to drink it,

and then when my girlfriend

got alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l poisoning,

he just ditched us at the ER.

</line>


<line>
Was your girlfriend okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I mean, it was scary in the moment.

</line>


<line>
We were there all night

and they pumped her stomach.

</line>


<line>
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.

[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers] But things are good now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hings are good. Because at some point,

I realized it wasn't the alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l's fault,

or <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ddy's fault, or my fault.

It was just some shitty dude, you know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally.

</line>


<line>
But you know the craziest part of all?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he guy, he's actually kind of famous.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yeah, I never heard of him,

but it turns out

he's kind of a movie star.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is he?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[exhales]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Um...
