</line>


<line>
-[waves crashing]

-[bell tolling]

</line>


<line>
A hummingbird smiled at me

on my walk this morning.

</line>


<line>
In small pleasures such as this,

I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.

</line>


<line>
-As you ought.

-And yet...

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Out with it, <name type="PERSON">Sister Marguerite</name>.

</line>


<line>
To hesitate is to waste time,

which is a sin when time

could be elsewise spent in prayer,

or handwashing Monsignor <name type="PERSON">Toscani</name>'s

1962 <name type="ORG">Alfa Romeo</name>,

which is itself a form of prayer,

is it not?

</line>


<line>
Of course. Yet I find myself consumed

by thoughts of my past.

</line>


<line>
You have no past. You've confessed.

</line>


<line>
Your sins have been washed clean.

</line>


<line>
This is like day one stuff,

what are we talking about here?

</line>


<line>
The people I've hurt,

the lives I've ruined,

are they washed clean as well?

</line>


<line>
Your regrets are of no benefit

to the Lord.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ruminating</name> so is a solipsism unbefitting

a sister of the cloth.

</line>


<line>
Is it solipsism to be concerned

with the fates of others?

</line>


<line>
Perhaps one could argue

cloistering oneself from the world

is itself a form of solipsism.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> If one were being ungenerous.

</line>


<line>
Remember when you first arrived here

and you didn't talk for like two years?

</line>


<line>
I will trouble you no further, Mother.

</line>


<line>
Lord, how you challenge me

with so vexing a pupil.

</line>


<line>
-[car engine starts]

-Hmm?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[shouts]</nonVerbComm> What dereliction is this?!

</line>


<line>
When you get to Heaven,

look up <name type="PERSON">Margo</name> <name type="PERSON">Martindale</name>!

</line>


<line>
I won't be there, but my movies will!

</line>


<line>
-[tires screech]

-[<name type="PERSON">Margo</name> shouts]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I wanna know what's changed

since the strike.

</line>


<line>
Are assistants treated better or have

things reverted to business as usual?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, give me ten inches.

I also want a roast beef sub.

</line>


<line>
-Six inches.

-[intercom beeps]

</line>


<line>
-[woman] <ital><name type="PERSON">Paige</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name> is on her way up.</ital>

-Ah, shit.

</line>


<line>
She's the best reporter

this building's ever seen,

but, goddamn,

is that woman a pain in the ass.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Paige</name>]</nonVerbComm> Colleagues!

</line>


<line>
Your eyes do not deceive!

</line>


<line>
You may find my gown overly formal

for the workplace,

but that is because I am, as of today

formerly a member

of this vaulted institution.

</line>


<line>
As I'm to be wed tonight

and the newsroom is no room

for a domesticated woman,

</line>


<line>
-I bid you farewell.

-[man screams]

</line>


<line>
Okay, goodbye.

</line>


<line>
Yes, mine was a storied run

as the star reporter for "The Reporter."

</line>


<line>
"Front Page <name type="PERSON">Paige</name>," they called me!

</line>


<line>
-Well, we'll miss you, <name type="PERSON">Paige</name>.

-Indeed.

</line>


<line>
My shoes don't fill easy,

my left foot striking a more robust

silhouette than her starboard sister.

</line>


<line>
But I cannot prolong my engagement.

</line>


<line>
After all, time, as they say,

is a river without banks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Time</name> may not have banks,

but this periodical certainly does.

</line>


<line>
Maximillian <name type="PERSON">Banks</name>, at my service!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> Maximilian <name type="PERSON">Banks</name>.

</line>


<line>
I may lack your nose for news,

but I've got an eyeball for a highball!

</line>


<line>
Why, this man couldn't

string together two clauses

</line>


<line>
without ending on a preposition.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're referring to.

</line>


<line>
You could fill a library

with all the things you don't know.

</line>


<line>
In fact, they do.

They call them libraries.

</line>


<line>
Guys, we're trying to work here.

</line>


<line>
No matter, I shan't be staying.

</line>


<line>
My sweet betrothed, Bellamy,

awaits with champagne

to chauffeur me directly to my nuptials,

</line>


<line>
and I didn't think I'd visit long,

</line>


<line>
so I left him in the car

with the windows up. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Good, I've got business

to attend to as well.

</line>


<line>
I'll have you know it's almost time

for my mid-morning confabulation

</line>


<line>
with a former stage mother to the stars,

Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Carol</name> Himmelfarb-Richardson.

</line>


<line>
You've been taking those phone calls?!

</line>


<line>
Yes, she is as loony as a <name type="NORP">Canadian</name> dollar,

</line>


<line>
but she is a scintillating

conversationalist.

</line>


<line>
Oh? What about the conversation 

scintillates?

</line>


<line>
She calls every day to see if we have

any information on her dead daughter.

</line>


<line>
-The answer's always no.

-Sounds like a scoop.

</line>


<line>
It's not. It's a pop star who overdosed.

Open-and-shut case.

</line>


<line>
-All the better for opening and shutting.

-Why do you have that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>, my boy,

my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom,

</line>


<line>
best put the champagne on ice.

</line>


<line>
I've got a story that simply demands

my attention

and I just couldn't marry you

before it's settled.

</line>


<line>
I'd only be distracted,

which isn't fair to you or me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, darling, I've already committed

to being your wife.

</line>


<line>
What, you need to hear a few measly words?

</line>


<line>
Well, "I do." Does that satisfy?

</line>


<line>
I do, I do, I do,

</line>


<line>
and I do want you

to wait for me to ring you again shortly.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[snorts]</nonVerbComm> I knew you'd understand.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Mm! [snorts]

</line>


<line>
Now, as to the girl.

I smell beans. Spill 'em.

</line>


<line>
The girl's name was Sharon <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ Don't you touch my prickly muffin ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Did you ever notice that this music video

takes place in a planetarium,

</line>


<line>
-and <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> died in a planetarium?

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
-Uh... Hey, Tawnie.

-[music stops]

</line>


<line>
Are we going to this party?

</line>


<line>
I didn't come all the way down

to <name type="GPE">Manhattan</name>

to just watch you watch your boyfriend

be on the internet

at his parents' fancy house.

</line>


<line>
Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
It's not <name type="PERSON">Trey</name>'s fault he grew up

in an <name type="LOC">Upper Westside</name> brownstone.

</line>


<line>
Also, I'm not her boyfriend.

We're uncomplicated like that.

</line>


<line>
Come on! We're missing the party.

</line>


<line>
What? No. If we show up before 2:00,

everyone's gonna think we're losers.

</line>


<line>
Fine. But can't we do something else

while we wait? [gasps]

</line>


<line>
Let's explore the city!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[siren wailing]

</line>


<line>
The Big Apple.

</line>


<line>
There she is.

</line>


<line>
Apparently, there's a bar around here

called Hartigan's.

</line>


<line>
My cousin and his friends call it

"They-Don't-<name type="PERSON">Cardigan</name>'s." I don't get it.

</line>


<line>
Wow, a real <name type="GPE">New York</name> bar.

That could be cool.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, a bar! But how often are we

in <name type="GPE">New York</name>?

</line>


<line>
Let's go to the top

of the Empire State Building,

like the big ape

in that movie, <ital>Sleepless in <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right! Big building!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thunder rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Lord, we thank You for this bounty-- <name type="PERSON">Ella</name>?

</line>


<line>
That place you sent me didn't fix me.

</line>


<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

Daddy.

</line>


<line>
Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blasted

chicken fingers from Chicken-4-<name type="PERSON">Dayz</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not staying. I'm going to a place

where the people accept me.

</line>


<line>
You sit your ass in that chair, <name type="PERSON">Ella</name>,

because that place is right here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, Daddy!

</line>


<line>
That's what I wish I'd said.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen <name type="PERSON">Ella</name> in four years,

but every night I bring home dinner,

</line>


<line>
I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted

chicken fingers just for her,

so that if she ever comes home...

</line>


<line>
<ital>she'll know that she's welcome</ital>

<ital>at our table.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> Jannings,

our little indie film darling,

</line>


<line>
I think I speak for both of us

when I say gooba, gooba, hey, yah, yah!

</line>


<line>
Tears. Feel my cheeks.

Damp cheeks over here.

</line>


<line>
I do notice it's not

as Chicken-4-<name type="PERSON">Dayz</name>-focused

as maybe it seemed in the outline stage?

</line>


<line>
Talk us through your journey there.

</line>


<line>
What do you want?

You want a close-up of the bucket?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I think that would make it

feel like a commercial,

and what's so innovative

about this content

is that it's not a commercial.

</line>


<line>
Right, I forgot about the innovative part

of it. Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Our target demo responds poorly

when they feel

they're being advertised to,

but they love stories that engage them

on their level,

utilizing themes of inclusivity,

as well as dunking on the olds.

</line>


<line>
Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds,

is there any way to get more of that in?

</line>


<line>
-Well, we already shot the ad.

-Not an ad.

</line>


<line>
The immersive product placement journey.

</line>


<line>
But maybe I can find takes

that are in more of a dunking tone,

as well as shots

that highlight more prominently

but do not feature the bucket

of chicken-bacon finger-blasters.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for letting us help you share

your beautiful vision with the world.

</line>


<line>
No. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[bicycle bell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry, it's bullshit.

</line>


<line>
A gig's a gig.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">Vassar</name> doesn't accept indie cred

in lieu of my daughter's tuition.

</line>


<line>
I just don't believe it.

You're a way better director than I am.

</line>


<line>
If you'd told me that one day

you'd be doing chicken commercials--

</line>


<line>
-Not a commercial.

-That you'd be doing

sponsored content pre-roll

for <ital>Beverly Hillbillies </ital>reruns on <name type="ORG">Gronkle</name>

while I'm directing another

action-adventure blockbuster,

this one set in the world

of competitive ballroom dancing,

working title, "Balls to the Wall,"

if you'd told me that...

</line>


<line>
You'd be super-stoked?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,

but then eventually,

I would get around to being outraged.

</line>


<line>
-[coughing]

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
It is fun that we're both working

on the same lot, though.

</line>


<line>
-Right?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-[cell phone buzzing]

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
-What now?

-[man speaking indistinctly]

</line>


<line>
Again? Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah. I'll talk to her.

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
What are these new pages?

Why do I have new pages?

</line>


<line>
You don't like the new pages?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> The content of the pages

is not the issue, <name type="ORG">Justin</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-I spent time preparing the other pages.

</line>


<line>
You understand?

</line>


<line>
I rehearsed them. I studied them.

That's precious time I'll never get back!

</line>


<line>
And then some person--

I don't know this person--

</line>


<line>
And by the way, I don't like strange

persons knocking on my door

and then letting themselves in.

The knock is so I can tell you to enter.

</line>


<line>
If you just enter,

 what is the purpose of the knock?

</line>


<line>
You're right, of course.

</line>


<line>
My point is about the pages.

Why are you throwing new things at me?

</line>


<line>
The insurance guys are nixing

the car chase.

</line>


<line>
We had to think fast, so we put together

a new hand-to-hand combat scene

we're gonna throw on top

of the meringue number.

</line>


<line>
-So, it's a stunt?

-I thought you'd be excited.

</line>


<line>
I'm excited!

It's more time spent on your face.

</line>


<line>
Ever since I directed you in that episode

of "FBI: Female Body Inspectors,"

</line>


<line>
I thought... [chuckles]

"I gotta give this woman her close-up."

</line>


<line>
Don't produce me, <name type="ORG">Justin</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Is there choreography?

When am I learning this stunt?

</line>


<line>
April's gonna be on set.

She'll make sure you understand the stunt.

</line>


<line>
-And it's gonna be safe?

-We are taking every precaution.

</line>


<line>
And we are not gonna shoot

until you are 100 percent comfortable.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

I didn't mean to bite your head off.

</line>


<line>
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?

-Totally my fault.

</line>


<line>
I should've warned you.

</line>


<line>
Is there something else going on

that I should know about?

</line>


<line>
I'm fine. I'm actually being

really cool here.

</line>


<line>
I'm not some kind of monster

just because I don't like surprises.

</line>


<line>
I'm number one on the call sheet.

I'm entitled to a little respect.

</line>


<line>
No, you're right.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I've worked on projects

where the number one on the call sheet

was like an actual crazy person,

so I think I'm being really cool.

</line>


<line>
-You are being so cool.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>]</nonVerbComm> Can you wait

until you're out of earshot

to make your exasperated sighs, please?

</line>


<line>
Yes, sorry!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[jazz music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all] Huh? [dogs panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>! You can't

compare yourself to <name type="ORG">Justin</name> Kenyon.

</line>


<line>
-What's the difference?

-The difference is he has a great agent.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> That was a joke,

but I see you're in no mood.

</line>


<line>
I'm a good director.

</line>


<line>
Yes, but <name type="ORG">Justin</name>'s movies

make actual money.

</line>


<line>
The last big movie you were on,

you got fired off of.

</line>


<line>
Explain this to me.

</line>


<line>
I didn't break

into the <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> Library alone

and yet I'm the only one

whose career has suffered.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think that is?

</line>


<line>
Kelse, I don't know by what fancy

the fates push us about

in their great cosmic dance.

</line>


<line>
-I am but an agent.

-What about these stories I keep hearing

about how people wanna hire

more female directors?

</line>


<line>
Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.

Just not for this particular project.

</line>


<line>
Which particular project?

</line>


<line>
Anyone. I mean, you name it.

Whatever <name type="PERSON">Paul</name> Feig's doing.

</line>


<line>
You need to get me out of director jail.

</line>


<line>
Even <name type="PERSON">Roman Polanski</name> works more than I do,

and he should be in actual jail.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, for his last

couple of movies, at least, right? Woof!

</line>


<line>
No. Not for his last couple of movies.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Carol</name>, be a doll and tell this dame

what you told me.

</line>


<line>
I just don't understand

why my daughter would start using again.

</line>


<line>
She was sober.

She was going to AA meetings.

</line>


<line>
You suspect foul play?

</line>


<line>
Listen to this,

the last voicemail I ever got from her,

</line>


<line>
-a month before she died.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Hey, <name type="PERSON">Mommy</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I got out of a meeting

and we're making amends,

so I just wanted to say I'm sorry

I'm such a disappointment. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed

with the chic minimalism

of your new sun room.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you

as my older sister

when we met <name type="PERSON">David</name> Hasselhoff

at the Kids' Choice Awards.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I've never been

enough for you, <name type="PERSON">Mommy</name>!

</line>


<line>
What an angel.

She just wanted me to be happy.

</line>


<line>
What is the "we"?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Yeah! At the beginning.

</line>


<line>
She says, "We're making amends."

Who's this "we"?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutter clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know, we don't have to go

to this party if you don't want to.

</line>


<line>
What? I'm the one who keeps saying,

"Let's go to the party."

</line>


<line>
The only reason I came down here was so

we could go to this party and get drunk.

</line>


<line>
Come on. I've gone to like

a hundred parties with you.

</line>


<line>
You always say you're gonna drink,

and you never do, which is fine,

by the way!

</line>


<line>
No one's ever offered me a drink.

</line>


<line>
I keep waiting

for this famous peer pressure

</line>


<line>
I've heard so much about

and it never happens!

</line>


<line>
You wanna go have a drink? Here I am,

your peer, pressuring you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm nervous about losing control,

you know?

</line>


<line>
I think drinking alcohol

might not be for you.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna be scared of something

that's supposed to be fun.

</line>


<line>
That's why I wanna go to that party

with a bunch of strangers.

</line>


<line>
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don't

want it to be in front of people I know.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, weirdo.

-[chuckles] You're a weirdo.

</line>


<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

Daddy.

</line>


<line>
Do you think we should ADR her saying

"Daddy-o" more of a dunk?

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-[cell phone rings]

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Um, hello?

</line>


<line>
Am I speaking

to the future director of "Fireflame"?!

</line>


<line>
-What's that?

-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Another one?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but the difference is this one's

about a lady superhero,

which means this one you could

actually get hired on!

</line>


<line>
I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a woman.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. You think <name type="ORG">Justin</name> Kenyon says,

</line>


<line>
"I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a man"?

</line>


<line>
Of course not! He says, "Money,

money, money. <name type="PERSON">Nom</name>, nom, nom."

</line>


<line>
I have heard him say that.

</line>


<line>
Besides, they don't want this

to be just another superhero movie.

</line>


<line>
They're looking for someone who can make

a superhero movie with a twist!

</line>


<line>
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?

</line>


<line>
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
But they do wanna hear your take,

by which I mean they want you,

as a woman, to tell them their take.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> I've been saying for years

as soon as we run out

of popular male characters

and we've given them each two sequels,

we have to make a movie about Fireflame!

</line>


<line>
I think that's really edgy

and outside the box.

</line>


<line>
Outside is exactly where we're trying

to be, in relation to the box.

</line>


<line>
We really think Fireflame can connect

with today's <name type="PERSON">Yas Queen</name> culture.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I got a real <name type="PERSON">Yas Queen</name> vibe

from her.

</line>


<line>
She comes in, she saves the day,

everyone loves her!

</line>


<line>
-Wow.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Didn't I tell you this would make

a great movie?

</line>


<line>
Uh, pretty sure I told you, <name type="PERSON">Nancy</name>.

I have always loved Fireflame.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I remember now,

you did tell me that.

</line>


<line>
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.

</line>


<line>
We're obviously gonna hear a lot of takes,

but it seems like you have

a special connection to the material.

</line>


<line>
I do.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[elevator dings]</nonVerbComm>

<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Paige</name> snorting]</nonVerbComm> Aw. Aha!

</line>


<line>
I'm famished. Let's find a place where

I can get a glass with an olive in it.

</line>


<line>
Try to stay on task, won't you, Maxy?

</line>


<line>
If <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> was going to meetings here,

someone must have seen her,

and if someone saw something,

then I wanna know it,

particularly as it pertains--

</line>


<line>
What crime have I committed

to deserve so long a sentence?

</line>


<line>
I've got a point.

</line>


<line>
Once you arrived at it,

send me a postcard.

</line>


<line>
The starlet was alone

when she died, right?

</line>


<line>
But there was someone else

with her while she was blotto.

</line>


<line>
Who was that person? What'd they see?

</line>


<line>
And why weren't they mentioned

in the police report?

</line>


<line>
There's your who, what and why.

</line>


<line>
Get a when and a where in there,

and we've got ourselves a story.

</line>


<line>
Bully for you, you're almost caught up

to where I was an hour ago.

</line>


<line>
Let's chat again in an hour

when you've gotten to where I'm at now.

</line>


<line>
Sounds good.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime, someone in this building

might just offer the key

that opens the gate to the garden

with the tree that bears the fruit

that is our scoop.

</line>


<line>
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting?

</line>


<line>
I do believe one "A"

of the two stands for "anonymous."

</line>


<line>
The other "A",

I could not possibly fathom.

</line>


<line>
I envy your faith in the honor

and discretion of other people.

</line>


<line>
Let's see how that honor stacks up

against the desire

to dish on celebrities

so as to appear swank by association.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, kind stranger.

I'm writing a story

</line>


<line>
-on the efficacy of your program.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
I understand one of the pillars

is anonymity, but if you could...

</line>


<line>
I once saw Ferguson</name> here!

I don't know why I said that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
I really shouldn't say. It's anonymous,

but I have seen <name type="PERSON">Robert Downey</name>, Jr.

</line>


<line>
Jamie <name type="PERSON">Lee</name> Curtis winked at me once.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Colin Farrell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Russell Brand</name>,

the Monkey.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I've seen.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
About a month before she died.

It was pretty clear she was using.

</line>


<line>
Well, how do you figure?

Did she say something?

</line>


<line>
She didn't, but her friend did.

</line>


<line>
-Her friend?

-Large fella.

</line>


<line>
I think he was a horse

or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.

</line>


<line>
Kind of like a rounder <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> Garrett type,

but with a very forgettable face.

</line>


<line>
He told a story, though, I remember that.

</line>


<line>
It was about a trip he took to...

<name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is so long ago now.

</line>


<line>
I think he had sex with the girl,

or maybe he had sex with the mother?

</line>


<line>
Well, do get your story sorted,

but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.

</line>


<line>
And this man left with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
Do you recall anything else

about this man, his name, perhaps?

</line>


<line>
No, but I remember the girl's name.

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

now we're all up to speed.

</line>


<line>
No, the girl from his story.

The one in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
He was weirdly proud of it,

said her name was Penny <name type="PERSON">Carson</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Carson</name>, eh?

</line>


<line>
"Penny <name type="PERSON">Carson</name>," he said. "And that's

her real name, you can look her up!"

</line>


<line>
I remember thinking,

"Why does he want us to look her up?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Hmm.

</line>


<line>
So she's sexy,

but don't you call her sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
-[laughs] Boy.

-Oh, that is so Fireflame.

</line>


<line>
-[yelps]

-Oh, wow!

</line>


<line>
-Stop!

-What?

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, I can't let you--

-Uh, excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Are you already-- Sorry.

I'm sure she's got a great pitch,

but the movie you want,

it's just not realistic.

</line>


<line>
Sure it is.

<name type="ORG">Wendy</name> Wiggum ate fire as a baby

and now she holds the power

of the Fireflame. It's all very logical.

</line>


<line>
No, I just mean you're doing this

all wrong.

</line>


<line>
She saves the day,

and everybody loves her?

</line>


<line>
I mean, yeah, that makes sense

if she's a man.

</line>


<line>
But it's never worked like that for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, this isn't about you.

</line>


<line>
That's right! It's about an exotic dancer

who's also interdimensional.

</line>


<line>
No. I mean the rules are different

for women.

</line>


<line>
If you're a woman

and you save the day, nobody loves you.

</line>


<line>
People take you for granted,

or worse, they resent you.

</line>


<line>
They punish you.

</line>


<line>
The more powerful you are,

the more they'll take your power away.

</line>


<line>
And I just think if your movie is smart,

you'll acknowledge that.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.

-Yeah, it's a bummer.

</line>


<line>
Being a superhero is hard.

Otherwise, everyone would do it.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, thank you for--

</line>


<line>
Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.

Not aspirational enough, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
But it's real. And it's different.

</line>


<line>
Also, in my version, she's gay. Okay, bye!

</line>


<line>
-You fell like a foot.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
-Why did you drop me?

-Why'd you scream at me?

</line>


<line>
-Hey, guys--

-I didn't know he was gonna dip me.

</line>


<line>
-That's not what we rehearsed!

-You said to have fun with it.

</line>


<line>
I meant fun energy.

I didn't mean change the choreography.

</line>


<line>
I can't do this. I am number one

on the call sheet...

</line>


<line>
-[overlapping dialogue]

-...and all I ask for is a modicum

</line>


<line>
-Breaking news! She's number one!

-of respect and professionalism.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's everybody cool down.

</line>


<line>
Do not tell me to cool down

like I'm the crazy person here.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to have

a safe workplace environ--

</line>


<line>
I had you.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

</line>


<line>
-I'm... I'm going home.

-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, we need to get this sequence,

</line>


<line>
-and we are already behind.

-Not my problem.

</line>


<line>
I get that you're mad, and you're

totally right, but everybody else here--

</line>


<line>
<ital>Not </ital>my problem.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> sighs]

You got that dip, though, right?

<nonVerbComm>[dance music playing]</nonVerbComm>

Okay. <name type="PERSON">Trey</name> and I will be in the coatroom,

doing hand stuff.

-Otherwise, you don't know anybody here.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-[man] Oh! What do you see?

-What?

</line>


<line>
You're having an anxiety attack, so look

around the room and tell me what you see.

</line>


<line>
I-I see people partying and passing out!

</line>


<line>
What else do you see?

</line>


<line>
Um, books. Pizza boxes.

I see light fixtures.

</line>


<line>
I see an odd amount of floor poofs.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, now say your name.

-Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
-Last name too.

-No, we'll be here all night.

</line>


<line>
-You feel any calmer?

-Yeah, actually. A little bit.

</line>


<line>
It's a trick my psychiatrist taught me.

It's supposed to help you ground yourself.

</line>


<line>
-Thanks.

-Except for the saying your name part.

</line>


<line>
That's not really part of it.

I just wanted to know your name.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Okay, cool.

</line>


<line>
I-I'm Peter, by the way.

</line>


<line>
Just so you don't have to wait for me

to have an anxiety attack too. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock.

-Yeah, I know.

</line>


<line>
Oh. [chuckles] Right.

</line>


<line>
So, this party's kind of crowded.

You wanna go get some air?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But it's pretty cold out.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah, that's true.

-But we're wearing jackets!

</line>


<line>
Also true.

</line>


<line>
Darling, you must keep the cake cold

and the flowers fresh

for just a moment longer.

</line>


<line>
This story has revealed itself

to be thornier than a rose bush

and just as sweet. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
When shall I return?

Well, I haven't sorted that out yet.

</line>


<line>
It seems I've gone

to <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name> for a spell.

</line>


<line>
-[wind howls]

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Well, we're here.

</line>


<line>
So I wanted to talk to you because

I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"!

</line>


<line>
"Fireflame"? Get that money.

<name type="PERSON">Nom</name>, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

</line>


<line>
Yeah. So I need an actress.

Someone tough, but vulnerable.

</line>


<line>
I know you're working with <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> <name type="PERSON">Cazador</name>.

What do you think of her?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> Look, if you've seen her work,

you know what she can do.

</line>


<line>
She's very versatile. Really talented.

</line>


<line>
But personality-wise, what's she like?

Is she good to work with?

</line>


<line>
I can't risk any drama on set.

There's too much riding on this for me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> If I'm being honest,

I can't recommend her.

</line>


<line>
-No?

-Especially if you have a lot of stunts.

</line>


<line>
I mean, don't get me wrong,

she's great on camera. She just...

</line>


<line>
-Uh... She can be a little difficult.

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what happened.

</line>


<line>
I worked with her a couple years ago,

she was great, but, um...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales sharply]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know who'd be perfect?

Courtney <name type="PERSON">Portnoy</name>!

</line>


<line>
Oh! I love her.

</line>


<line>
I've heard nothing but good things.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
It's fine.

You're not even supposed to like it yet.

</line>


<line>
It tastes okay-er over time.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er

over time myself.

</line>


<line>
You know, I actually didn't even drink

for like all of college.

</line>


<line>
I had some shit go down

in high school, and...

</line>


<line>
You know, there was this girl in my town.

Anyway, it's a long story.

</line>


<line>
No, I wanna hear it.

</line>


<line>
Okay. She had this man

living in her house.

</line>


<line>
You mean like more than one dad?

</line>


<line>
No, no, she had just the one dad,

but then there was this other guy.

</line>


<line>
-Weird.

-Totally weird, right?

</line>


<line>
Okay. So this girl was best friends

with my girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
We all went to prom together:

me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.

</line>


<line>
Wait, the man went to prom with you?

Yeesh.

</line>


<line>
That's not even the yeesh-iest part.

</line>


<line>
This guy bought us bourbon

and practically forced us to drink it,

and then when my girlfriend

got alcohol poisoning,

he just ditched us at the ER.

</line>


<line>
Was your girlfriend okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I mean, it was scary in the moment.

</line>


<line>
We were there all night

and they pumped her stomach.

</line>


<line>
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.

[stammers] But things are good now.

</line>


<line>
Things are good. Because at some point,

I realized it wasn't the alcohol's fault,

or <name type="PERSON">Maddy</name>'s fault, or my fault.

It was just some shitty dude, you know?

</line>


<line>
Totally.

</line>


<line>
But you know the craziest part of all?

</line>


<line>
The guy, he's actually kind of famous.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yeah, I never heard of him,

but it turns out

he's kind of a movie star.

</line>


<line>
Who is he?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm> Um...

</line>


<line>
Who is he?
