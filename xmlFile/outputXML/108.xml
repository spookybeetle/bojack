<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Oh, right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, just tell whoever,</ital>

<ital>then.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Haaah!

- [tires screech]

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[honks horn]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Asshole!

- [tires squeal]

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu

to see <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>.

</line>


<line>
He has cancer, which,

as you know, is a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
Plus, he hates me,

so I could really use

some good news

at the end of the day.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

You're going to see <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
You must be really--

Nope.

</line>


<line>
- Don't care. Not interested.

- [phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Okay, Good talk.

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
- Ready for this?

- Listen.

</line>


<line>
I want to make sure

I don't spend

any time alone with <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm bringing you

along as my buffer.

</line>


<line>
And your memoirist.

</line>


<line>
I should meet

your old best friend

before he dies of cancer.

</line>


<line>
Fine, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Just don't abandon me.

</line>


<line>
No bathroom breaks.

</line>


<line>
And don't slip out

of the room

to text your fiancé

a bunch of winky smileys

with hearts next to them--

Gross.

</line>


<line>
Congratulations on

the whole being engaged thing,

</line>


<line>
- by the way.

- Thanks.

</line>


<line>
It's just starting

to hit me.

</line>


<line>
I'm getting married.

</line>


<line>
Thank <name type="PERSON">God</name> I don't

have to die alone.

</line>


<line>
- No offense.

- None taken.

</line>


<line>
Till you said, "No offense."

</line>


<line>
So what's the deal with you

and this guy?

</line>


<line>
You never talk about him.

</line>


<line>
Well, I kind of, maybe

stabbed him in the back.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

</line>


<line>
A story of power, betrayal,

and ambitious hairstyles.

</line>


<line>
The year?

198--

</line>


<line>
- Movie's over.

- Watch the next one.

</line>


<line>
Aw, I'm tired

of watching movies.

</line>


<line>
- Do you want to play a game?

- Sure.

</line>


<line>
I spy with my little eye

someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> needs

to shut the hell up.

</line>


<line>
- Is it me?

- It's always you.

</line>


<line>
- Now, where was I?

- You were about to tell

a story about you being

a shitty friend,

but then, we got interrupted

by you yelling at Todd.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

Shut up, Todd.

Here. I got you a beer.

It's on the house.

Don't tell my boss.

</line>

Thanks, <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>,

but one beer gets me tipsy.

</line>


<line>
I got to be clear-headed

for my set.

</line>


<line>
Looks like <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s killing.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and the suits

from <name type="ORG">ABC</name> are here.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

Look. They're nodding.

Oh, before I forget.

<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> and I are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see

<line>
<ital>Back to the Future </ital>again

this weekend.

</line>


<line>
- Want to come?

- I'm in.

</line>


<line>
That movie was amazing,

except for all

the lame time period jokes.

</line>


<line>
We get it.

The '50s were different.

</line>


<line>
I'll have

a New <name type="ORG">Coke</name>, please.

</line>


<line>
Listen, you guys don't need

to include me on your dates.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes, it makes me feel

like a third wheel.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, stop.

</line>


<line>
Without the third wheel,

</line>


<line>
how would you ride

a tricycle?

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't that make it

a bicycle?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>,

ladies and gentlemen.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hey-ooh!

- Great set, man.

</line>


<line>
It's like everything

you said was something

</line>


<line>
I've thought before but never

had the balls to say.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, <name type="PERSON">BJ</name>.

I set 'em up.

</line>


<line>
Now, you knock 'em down.

</line>


<line>
Let's give it up

for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
- [applause]

- Well, thank you, Bubbles.

</line>


<line>
I love <name type="GPE">L.A.</name>

Don't you guys?

</line>


<line>
The prettiest girls in

the world flock to this city,

and they end up

with total knobs.

</line>


<line>
Take this couple,

for example.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, miss.

Is that your date?

</line>


<line>
He's my husband.

</line>


<line>
That's your husband?

You can do better.

</line>


<line>
Give me a call

after the show.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- I'm just kidding around.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whispers]</nonVerbComm>

I'm not kidding around.

<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Maker's Manhattan?

2:00 P.M.?

</line>


<line>
Not judging.

</line>


<line>
That guy tipped me a quarter.

</line>


<line>
That's barely enough money

to buy three gallons of gas.

</line>


<line>
- You want a slug?

- No, I got to stay sharp.

</line>


<line>
I got another audition

this afternoon.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, I can't wait till

I'm finally up

</line>


<line>
for real jobs instead

of these dumb commercials.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">"Here</name>'s the thing about

most long-distance plans."

</line>


<line>
Ugh. I hate

when people say that.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">"Here</name>'s the thing."

- It's so stupid.

</line>


<line>
Just say the thing.

</line>


<line>
You don't need to introduce

the concept

that there's going

to be a thing.

</line>


<line>
I don't expect to

be offered <ital>Secretariat</ital>

right away,

but when am I <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be up

for real roles?

</line>


<line>
We'll get there, <name type="PERSON">BJ</name>.

We both will.

</line>


<line>
In fact, if I play

my cards right,

</line>


<line>
I might get there real soon.

</line>


<line>
Wait.

</line>


<line>
- Did the guys from <name type="ORG">ABC</name> call?

- Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
They invited me

to some hotshot event

at LACMA this weekend.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> pitch 'em a TV show

while they're drunk.

</line>


<line>
An off-the-clock,

non-work-related social event?

</line>


<line>
That's the perfect time

to pitch a TV show.

</line>


<line>
You're brilliant.

</line>


<line>
These people are so fancy.

</line>


<line>
Look, look, look.

Hey, hey, look.

</line>


<line>
That's <name type="PERSON">Joyce DeWitt</name>,

isn't it?

</line>


<line>
That's <name type="PERSON">Joyce DeWitt</name>.

And that's <name type="PERSON">Angela</name> Diaz.

</line>


<line>
And that's Ubu,

the guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> sits.

</line>


<line>
- He<ital> is </ital>a good dog.

- [Ubu barks]

</line>


<line>
Guys, don't take

your eyes off the prize.

</line>


<line>
We need to fill <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>'s bag

with these mini quiches.

</line>


<line>
This is our breakfast

for June.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>.

- Shit, we're busted.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Buongiorno. </ital><name type="ORG">Bon Jovi</name>.

</line>


<line>

Crap, that's English.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you mind if I steal

this superstar for a second?

</line>


<line>
Okay, yeah.

I'll catch you two later.

</line>


<line>
Stay out of trouble.

Oh, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, there he goes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s about to hit

the big time,

and I'm just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

a small-fry

doing tiny commercials

and eating mini quiches.

</line>


<line>
You're dead wrong.

</line>


<line>
You're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

a big success.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> says that to me

all the time.

</line>


<line>
- He thinks the world of you.

- He does?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not worried about

if you'll become a star.

</line>


<line>
I'm more worried about how

you'll change when it happens.

</line>


<line>
Like, you think I'll get fat?

</line>


<line>
No, that's not

what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
So you're saying

I definitely

</line>


<line>
- won't get fat?

- No.

</line>


<line>
Well, make up your mind,

lady.

</line>


<line>
Look over there.

See those tar pits?

</line>


<line>
Hollywood's a real pretty town

that's smack on top

of all that black tar.

</line>


<line>
By the time you realize

you're sinking,

it's too late.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is this

a science lesson?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

it's a metaphor.

</line>


<line>
- Ugh, that's worse.

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'm moving to Maine.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Really?

</line>


<line>
- Does <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> know?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I don't think I'm the person

<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s looking for.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to miss you,

<name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you ever wonder

what would have happened

if you'd met me

before <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> did?

</line>


<line>
Would you have made

a move on me?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>--

- I don't think you would have.

</line>


<line>
You know why?

</line>


<line>
I think you're a coward.

</line>


<line>
Now go stuff some prosciutto

in your pants

before that <name type="PERSON">Webster</name> kid

takes it all.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[upbeat music]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbComm> I love this town.

a knife fight

like in

<ital>Rebel Without a Cause?</ital>

</line>


<line>
- I hate that title.

- He had several causes.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to give you this.

</line>


<line>
Look out at that city.

</line>


<line>
What do you see?

</line>


<line>
Wow, I didn't realize

there were

so many day hookers.

</line>


<line>
I see a city

that you and I

will r<name type="ORG">un</name> someday,

and when we're both famous

and have everything

we've ever wanted,

we'll come back here together

and high five.

</line>


<line>
I'm not fully on board

with this new high five thing.

</line>


<line>
What ever happened

to the low five?

</line>


<line>
Give me some skin.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BJ</name>, listen.

I got a call from <name type="ORG">ABC</name> today.

</line>


<line>
They bought my TV pitch.

</line>


<line>
What?

That's amazing.

</line>


<line>
- What's the show?

- It's called <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, good luck

on your rocket ship

to the top without me.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

the show's about a horse,

and I told those suits

if they want my show,

then that horse is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

be <name type="PERSON">BJ</name> Goddamn <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

- And they said, "No."

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- And I said, "Please?"

</line>


<line>
And they said, <name type="PERSON">"Okay</name>."

</line>


<line>
So, what do you say?

</line>


<line>
- Want to be my star?

- Seriously?

</line>


<line>
Of course I do.

Of course, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ, thank you.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm--

Whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
I think you got

the wrong idea here.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, no, man. Whoa.

- <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, I'm not--

</line>


<line>
Me either.

No, I just-- You know,

</line>


<line>
- I caught up in the moment.

- Yeah, no, I gotcha.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BJ</name>, can you believe it?

</line>


<line>
We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> make

an actual TV show!

</line>


<line>
One that takes

an unflinching look

at the gritty reality

of the American family.

</line>


<line>

Did my character suddenly forget

that he didn't want to wear

the sweater?

</line>


<line>
No, see,

that's actually the joke.

</line>


<line>
Don't explain the joke to me.

</line>


<line>
I just don't understand

how it's a joke.

</line>


<line>
So you do want me

to explain it to you?

I want you to add

a scene showing

how I changed my

so the goddamn episode

makes sense.

to the stories I requested?

</line>


<line>
Where's my rap?

You said you'd write me a rap.

</line>


<line>
We're working on it.

</line>


<line>
We just need a rhyme for

"and I'm here to say."

</line>


<line>
Well, what about giving me

Rollerblades?

<line>
How are people <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> know

<line>
Just get out there

Sheeeiiiiit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I gotta tell ya.

</line>


<line>
- I'm gay.

- No doy.

</line>


<line>
I know we haven't been close

for the past couple years.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> hold back

my "No doys"

because there might be a lot.

</line>


<line>
But you know me, right?

</line>


<line>
You know that I'm a good guy.

</line>


<line>
They're gunning for me

at the network,

and if I get kicked off this,

I won't recover.

</line>


<line>
I need to know that

you've got my back.

</line>


<line>
If you threaten to walk,

they'll listen to you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, you picked

the worst possible time to--

</line>


<line>
Hey, you know I wouldn't

ask if I didn't need it.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
How'd we get

so far apart, huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know what?

You can count on me, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I wouldn't even be here

if it weren't for you.

</line>


<line>
I knew it!

I knew you'd come through.

</line>


<line>
And when this is all over,

we're going

to drive back up

to <name type="PERSON">Griffith</name> Park.

</line>


<line>
I still owe you

that high five, right?

</line>


<line>
Hey, this is

a dumb question,

but do you guys ever,

like, all link up together

and do, like, a party train

or a f<name type="ORG">un</name> circle?

</line>


<line>
'Cause I feel like

I'd be doing that all the--

</line>


<line>
Never mind.

Stupid question.

</line>


<line>
Feel stupid for asking that.

</line>


<line>
- [crowd shouting]

- [barking]

</line>


<line>
Go right ahead.

</line>


<line>
And then it goes,

"I like healthy gums

in a major way."

</line>


<line>
See, that's

what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
That's great.

</line>


<line>
We just gotta make sure

that we work in the phrase

</line>


<line>
"toothbrush rap" early,

so they know I'm rapping.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

can we chat for a second?

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Here we go.

It's the big one.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> waste

your time with small talk

because you work for me,

and your time is my time.

</line>


<line>
We're letting <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> go.

</line>


<line>
- You can't do that.

- "I can't do that."

</line>


<line>
I'm not asking you.

It's nothing personal.

</line>


<line>
I like <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

I think he's a good guy.

</line>


<line>
But this is a business,

and every day

we don't fire him,

we're flushing money

</line>


<line>
- down the crapper.

- Well, if he goes, I go.

</line>


<line>
"Well, if he goes, you go."

I wouldn't do that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I think you're a star,

and sometimes being a star

means making tough choices.

</line>


<line>
You can storm out,

make a big show out of

what a "good" friend

you are,

or you could be

the guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> does his job.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Angela</name>--

- I'll tell you when

it's your turn

to talk again.

</line>


<line>
Look, you're a star,

but this is really just

the beginning of

the <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name> story.

</line>


<line>
You can choose

whatever path you want,

but I'll tell you right now.

</line>


<line>
You don't win awards

and you don't

get to be on the covers

of magazines

and you don't get

to play the lead role

in the <ital>Secretariat </ital>movie

by being a good friend.

</line>


<line>
What's that old expression

about how the show must go on?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

It's "Don't be an idiot."

</line>


<line>
So what do you think, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

That's a courtesy question.

</line>


<line>
I already know what you think

because I have conversations

like this one five times a day.

</line>


<line>
I know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> you are,

and I know

you've already

made your decision.

</line>


<line>
But if you want

to surprise me,

now's the time to do it.

</line>


<line>
That's what I thought.

</line>


<line>
You're doing the right thing.

I know it's hard.

</line>


<line>
But if <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s really your

friend, he'll understand.

</line>


<line>
Now, you've got

a show to put on,

so I'll let you get ready.

</line>


<line>
This was a good conversation.

Productive.

</line>


<line>
If you're lucky,

I'll never talk to you again.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[cup thuds]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[announcer]</nonVerbComm> You folks ready for a show?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
'Cause I think

a certain someone

might show up any second.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- [cheers and applause]

- Wait a minute.

</line>


<line>
This isn't the bar.

</line>


<line>
I gotta fire my assistant.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So what ended up happening

with <ital>Secretariat?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Went into turnaround.

</line>


<line>
I don't totally know

what "turnaround" means,

</line>


<line>
- but they never made the movie.

- Whoa.

</line>


<line>
This house is way bigger

than yours.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s done really well

for a guy you dicked over.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, no. Ah.

- That's enough out of you.

</line>


<line>
Stay out here

and turn this car around

in case we need to leave

in a hurry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>. A task.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

Well.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, you look shitty.

</line>


<line>
Have you been eating your guilt

this whole time?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you don't look

so hot yourself, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
I have cancer.

</line>


<line>
And hello.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s this stunning creature?

</line>


<line>
And what string

of bad decisions

has placed you

in <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s orbit?

</line>


<line>
- Uh--

- This is <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
She's writing a book

about me.

</line>


<line>
Pleasure to meet you.

</line>


<line>
Is your book called,

<ital>Portrait of an Asshole?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

I kid.

</line>


<line>
It's funny,

because he ruined my life.

</line>


<line>
I joke.

It's what I do.

</line>


<line>
Please, come in.

</line>


<line>
You're letting out

all the cancer.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[forced laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ha ha...

</line>


<line>
Almost.

Ah...

</line>


<line>
Almost there.

</line>


<line>
Come on... ah.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

- [bear growls]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, how are

your utensils?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, they're fine.

- Are you sure?

</line>


<line>
Because if that knife

ain't sharp enough,

</line>


<line>
I got another that you left

in my back 20 years ago.

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- Could have seen that coming.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> asks about utensils?

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go

to the bathroom.

</line>


<line>
Nope. No, you are not.

</line>


<line>
Uh.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Ow. Almost.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exciting music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Drive, drive, drive!

- Oh. Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
I can't turn

the car around.

</line>


<line>
I've been trying to do this

three-point turn forever.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's more

like a 300-point turn.

</line>


<line>
- Am I right, huh?

- Hee hee hee hee!

</line>


<line>
Hey, we've got two sacks

of <name type="NORP">Kardashian</name> swag

and the fuzz on our heels.

</line>


<line>
You think this is <name type="PERSON">Driver</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Ed</name>,

you hat-wearing pussy?

</line>


<line>
Drive the goddamn car!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

is that your <name type="ORG">Vitamix</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> has one, too.

</line>


<line>
I wonder if you guys have

strong opinions about it

one way or the other.

</line>


<line>
Well, the stupid thing

was like 600 bucks.

</line>


<line>
I have used mine

a grand total of zero times.

</line>


<line>
I got it a month before

I was diagnosed with cancer.

</line>


<line>
I don't give a shit

about being healthy anymore.

</line>


<line>
I don't even have cancer,

and I don't use it.

</line>


<line>
- So w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s it for?

- Exactly.

</line>


<line>
What is so great

about liquids?

</line>


<line>
Every article I read now is

"juice this" and "juice that."

</line>


<line>
You know why?

Juice controls the media.

</line>


<line>
- Hey-ooh.

- [both laugh]

</line>


<line>
Can't this thing

go any faster?

</line>


<line>
Uh, I'm going

as fast as I can.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[tires squealing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Do you want me to get out?

Try to guide you?

</line>


<line>
No, I think

I'm almost there.

</line>


<line>
You're doing a great job.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kenzie</name>, stop talking to him.

</line>


<line>
Why? He's being nice.

</line>


<line>
Remember

the number one rule

of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

</line>


<line>
- "No falling in love."

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
That's your rule

for every club.

</line>


<line>
It's a good rule.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

</line>


<line>
I'm sensing a lot

of hostility here.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we should take

our masks off and actually talk.

</line>


<line>
You want me to take

my mask off? Fine.

</line>


<line>
Happy?

I took my mask off.

</line>


<line>
Did you?

</line>


<line>
Because I think

you're still wearing a mask.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

you met President Clinton?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. Many times.

</line>


<line>
Did you think that

I spent the last 20 years

on my couch just feeling

sorry for myself?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I did do that,

but I also started...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm> a charity

to bring clean water

to millions of children

in Sub-Saharan <name type="LOC">Africa</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow.

</line>


<line>
I presented at

the Teen Choice Awards.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is that <name type="PERSON">Charlotte</name>?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah.

We kept in touch.

</line>


<line>
You should actually

give her a call.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure she'd

love to hear from you.

</line>


<line>
She looks good

for someone so old.

</line>


<line>
She's three years <name type="PERSON">yo</name>unger

than you.

</line>


<line>
- Exactly!

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- Er?

</line>


<line>
Well, guys,

I'm pretty beat.

</line>


<line>
I think I need to

head off to bed,

and I hope

I actually wake up later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And it was actually nice

to see you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
You can see yourselves out.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
"Juice controls the media."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

I love it.

</line>


<line>
So I guess in a sense

</line>


<line>
I'm running away

from the cops,

but I feel like in another,

truer sense,

</line>


<line>
I'm running away from myself.

</line>


<line>
- Truth. Truth.

- Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kenzie</name>, do you have

anything to share?

</line>


<line>
Just how amazing it feels

to finally

be honest for once.

</line>


<line>
I could live a million lives,

and I'd never forget

this one afternoon.

</line>


<line>
Word.

</line>


<line>
You know, I act all cool

and sophisticated

on the outside,

but on the inside,

I'm just Todd, you know?

</line>


<line>
But thanks to you guys,

I think I'm finally

</line>


<line>
- ready to let my guard down.

- Do you hear that?

</line>


<line>
- He's letting his guard down.

- Let's get him!

</line>


<line>
- [grunts]

- Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Celebrity stealing club

strikes again.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[upbeat music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
This-- This just doesn't

feel right.

</line>


<line>
I should have brought

a bottle of wine.

</line>


<line>
That's what adults do.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, damn it.

</line>


<line>
Is that what's bothering you,

</line>


<line>
- that you didn't bring wine?

- You're right.

</line>


<line>
I just would have drunk it

on the way here.

</line>


<line>
This isn't about wine,

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
If you have something

you need to say to someone,

you should do it

while you have the chance

because before you know it,

it'll be too late.

</line>


<line>
Is this one of those things

where we're talking

about <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> but we're actually

talking about something else?

</line>


<line>
- No, I was talking about <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheerfully]</nonVerbComm>

Hey, buddy!

</line>


<line>
You come back

for that <name type="ORG">Vitamix</name>, you--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ooh, you should get that

looked at.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I've been meaning

to see a doctor.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I wanted to talk

to you about... you know.

</line>


<line>
I feel bad about

what happened.

</line>


<line>
So you're apologizing.

</line>


<line>
Yes. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

I don't forgive you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, I said I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

and I do not forgive you.

</line>


<line>
Uh... not sure you get

what's happening here.

</line>


<line>
This could be

the last time that you--

</line>


<line>
No. I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>

give you closure.

</line>


<line>
You don't get that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm>

You have to live

with the shitty thing

you did

for the rest of your life.

</line>


<line>
You have to know that

it's never,

ever going to be okay.

</line>


<line>
I really think that

we'd both

</line>


<line>
- feel better if we just--

- I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> feel better,

and I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be your prop

so you can feel better.

</line>


<line>
You have to believe me.

</line>


<line>
- I did everything I could.

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Then why didn't you call me?

Huh?

</line>


<line>
20 years--

You didn't call me.

</line>


<line>
Look, I-- I wanted to,

but I didn't think--

</line>


<line>
You know what

it was like for me?

</line>


<line>
I had nobody.

Everybody left.

</line>


<line>
I knew all those showbiz phonies

would turn on me.

</line>


<line>
Sure. But you?

</line>


<line>
It's not my fault

you got fired.

</line>


<line>
I don't care about the job!

</line>


<line>
I did fine.

I had a good life.

</line>


<line>
But what I needed then

was a friend,

and you abandoned me.

</line>


<line>
And I will never forgive you

for that.

</line>


<line>
Now, get the fuck

out of my house.

</line>


<line>
I--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, this is a dumb question,

but the gay thing

and the rectal cancer thing

aren't related, are they?

</line>


<line>
- Get out of here!

- Never mind.

</line>


<line>
Stupid question.

Forget I brought it up.

</line>


<line>
- Huh.

- Hey, <name type="PERSON">BJ</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Put that back, asshole!

- No, you gave this to me.

</line>


<line>
- [growls]

- No!

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

What are you doing?

Get off him.

</line>


<line>
The show was never the same

after I left. Admit it.

</line>


<line>
Some people prefer

the later years.

</line>


<line>
- [growling]

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. Come on.

</line>


<line>
- [panting]

- Thank you for inviting us.

</line>


<line>
You have a lovely home.

</line>


<line>
You know what

your problem is?

</line>


<line>
You want to think of yourself

as the good guy.

</line>


<line>
Well, I know you better

than anyone,

and I can tell you

that you're not.

</line>


<line>
In fact, you'd probably sleep

a lot better at night

if you just admitted

to yourself

that you're a selfish

goddamn coward

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> takes whatever he wants

and doesn't give a shit

about w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> he hurts.

</line>


<line>
That's you.

That's <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why I came here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You do.

<nonVerbComm>[engine revs, tires screech]</nonVerbComm>

<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>You said you wanted a job.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter.

Nothing matters.

</line>


<line>
Wow.

What happened in Malibu?

</line>


<line>
- I gotta go.

- [phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Hey, bright side.

</line>


<line>
At least now you have

a good story to tell

at his funeral.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying

to kill the vibe here,

but I've had to pee

for, like, three hours.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Look, I won't put

what happened today

in the book

if you don't want me to.

</line>


<line>
No, it's okay.

</line>


<line>
Full truth like we agreed.

</line>


<line>
Warts and all.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter anyway.

</line>


<line>
I don't even care what anybody

thinks anymore.

</line>


<line>
Well, for

what it's worth,

</line>


<line>
I think it took

a lot of guts

to do what you did back there.
