  <title>One Trick Pony - <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name></title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
We're very different,

but I think that we bring out

the best in each other.

</line>


<line>
It's like you're chocolate

and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Shut up and kiss me,

you silly goof.

</line>


<line>
<ital>- </ital>Cut!

- [buzzer sounds]

</line>


<line>
Welcome back

to <ital>Excess Hollywoo.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">A <name type="PERSON">Ryan</name> Seacrest Type</name>,

and I'm visiting the set

</line>


<line>
of <ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm thrilled to be talking

to the star of the film,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>, and his

real life inspiration,

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Am I an inspiration?

</line>


<line>
Well, that depends

on how you define--

</line>


<line>
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
You know, I'm just over

the moon to be producing

this movie

about my daring exploit.

</line>


<line>
- Yes, your<ital> </ital>daring exploit.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
It's such a treat to be

shooting in my very own <ital>casa.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And it's an even sweeter treat

to be played by my good <ital>amigo--</ital>

dare I say best <ital>amigo?</ital>

</line>


<line>
- You "daren't."

- We're so in tune.

</line>


<line>
We even finish each other's...

sentences.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

</line>


<line>
- It never--

- Happens.

</line>


<line>
Ah, see?

I'm inside him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you haven't worked

in quite some time.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

I thought you were dead.

</line>


<line>
You must be so grateful to be

working again and also alive,

which, again,

I thought you were not.

</line>


<line>
How did you get involved

with this?

</line>


<line>
Well--

</line>


<line>
You want me to play

Mr. Peanutbutter

in the story he stole from me?

</line>


<line>
I stole the D,

and then he stole

my stealing of it.

</line>


<line>
That makes him an idea thief,

which is much less cool

than a thief thief,

which is what I am

and what he also is.

</line>


<line>
You know what might help?

</line>


<line>
If you think about this

like a professional

instead of a big titty baby.

</line>


<line>
This movie is

a huge opportunity.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Quentin</name> Tarantulino is known

for revitalizing dead careers.

</line>


<line>
This could do for you

what <ital>Reservoir Dogs</ital>

did for <name type="PERSON">Rin Tin Tin</name>.

</line>


<line>
But isn't there

any other part?

</line>


<line>
I could play myself.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s already being

played by <name type="PERSON">Wallace</name> <name type="PERSON">Shawn</name>.

</line>


<line>
What? The short guy

from <ital>The Princess Bride</ital>

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> says "inconceivable"?

</line>


<line>
- Why <name type="PERSON">Wallace</name> <name type="PERSON">Shawn</name>?

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to play

that boob.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to help

you out, <name type="PERSON">Wally</name>.

</line>


<line>
You're the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> keeps

buying expensive Rothkos.

</line>


<line>
I have a disease.

</line>


<line>
Would you tell an alcoholic

to stop buying alcohol?

</line>


<line>
You know,

<ital>Black and Blue Number 7's</ital>

going up for auction next week.

</line>


<line>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</line>


<line>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</line>


<line>
But if you find me in a bathtub

with open wrists tomorrow

and the words "I hate my agent"

smeared across the walls

in blood, you'll know why.

</line>


<line>
So obviously I'm thrilled

to be here, just thrilled.

</line>

Cast and crew only.

</line>


<line>
I know you're

just doing your job,

but I live here, and the crew

has been here since 3:00 a.m.,

so I'm a little tired.

</line>


<line>
Cast and crew only.

</line>


<line>
Hey, stranger.

</line>


<line>
Haven't really seen you

since the wedding.

</line>


<line>
Kind of feels like we're

coming back to school

</line>


<line>
- after summer vacation.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'll see you at the pep rally.

</line>


<line>
Hope we don't get Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Kirkman</name>

for trig this year.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, I hope

the cheerleaders don't stuff me

</line>


<line>
in a locker and write

"virgin slut" on my forehead,

and then when I ask how

I could be both a virgin

and a slut,

they make me eat a lipstick.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
So what have you been up to

these last couple months?

</line>


<line>
Well, I've been pretty busy.

Met a girl at <name type="ORG">So<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> <name type="ORG">House</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Was she your waitress?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

</line>


<line>
- Was she also your waitress?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Then I met a girl

at <name type="ORG">P.F.</name> Chang's.

</line>


<line>
Let me guess.

She was your--

</line>


<line>
A hooker, yes,

but what she really wants to do

</line>


<line>
- is wait tables.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
Well, I, for one,

would love to meet

the aspiring food-service worker

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> finally gets you

to settle down.

</line>


<line>
What?

Why would I want to settle down?

</line>


<line>
I'm 50.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, anyway...

- So I'm sending the first draft

of the book to <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>

this afternoon.

</line>


<line>
- What? It's done?

- Not yet. Almost.

</line>


<line>
I'm excited for you to read it,

</line>


<line>
but I'm also

cripplingly nervous.

</line>


<line>
I actually kind of feel

like throwing up,

</line>


<line>
but I can't throw up because

I haven't had anything to eat

because this lady won't let me

in my own kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Cast and crew only.

</line>


<line>
Listen, if reading a book

you wrote is anywhere near

</line>


<line>
as great as it is

to actually spend time with you,

</line>


<line>
I'm sure

it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be wonderful.

</line>


<line>
Having said that,

what do I know about books?

</line>


<line>
I'm just a dumb actor.

</line>


<line>
I'm here with Hollywoo darling

<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> Watts.

</line>


<line>
Tell me, what attracted you

to the role of <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

</line>


<line>
I just keep getting

pigeonholed

</line>


<line>
as these complex characters

in highly acclaimed movies.

</line>


<line>
For once, I would just love

to phone it in

</line>


<line>
and play a two-dimensional girl

in a rom com

</line>


<line>
with no inner life of her own.

</line>


<line>
That's kind of the reason

I got into this business.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha!

You said words.

</line>


<line>
Now, is it true you stay

in character between takes?

</line>


<line>
Oh, we all do.

The director insists upon it.

</line>


<line>
He even has everyone

calling me <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>

to help me get

in the headspace.

</line>


<line>
It's been great.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, looking good.

</line>


<line>
- Um, thanks.

- Ugh, not you.

</line>


<line>
I was talking to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
Now, where's my peanut butter?

</line>


<line>
Right over here, Q.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm looking

for peanut butter.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you mean <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
If I wanted <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

I would call <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Did someone call for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
It really cuts

down on confusion.

</line>


<line>
Ah, show business,

the great equalizer.

</line>


<line>
Is that what it is?

</line>


<line>
Todd, spritz me.

</line>


<line>
- Spritzing.

- Mm, mm, mm.

</line>


<line>
Well spritzed.

</line>


<line>
Have you ever been

on a movie set before?

</line>


<line>
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Please, Mr. Peanutbutter

was my father's name.

</line>


<line>
- Uh--

- And it's also my name!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[buzzer sounds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ooh, speaking

of Mr. Peanutbutter,

</line>


<line>
I'll be back

in a jiff, skippy.

</line>


<line>
Keep that air spritzed for me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Aloha</name>, <ital>kemosabe.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, allow me to put

on my producer hat

and produce you

just for one second here.

</line>


<line>
I have a few notes

on how you're playing me.

</line>


<line>
Let's see.

[humming]

</line>


<line>
Problems, problems, problems,

ah, here we go.

</line>


<line>
I find it really troubling

that my movie self

is wearing a crew neck <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt.

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
I only wear V-necks.

</line>


<line>
You see the problem.

</line>


<line>
- I do not.

- I just think if we're telling

the story, we should tell it

how it really happened.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, this whole story

isn't how it really happened.

</line>


<line>
Right...

because of the shirts.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> stole the D.

</line>


<line>
I'm the real hero here.

</line>


<line>
My life is full

of exciting adventures.

</line>


<line>
I should write a book.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait.

I did.

</line>


<line>
Suck on that, society.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you're in a mood.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps the tightness

of that crew neck

is cutting off circulation

to the brain?

</line>


<line>
Let me talk to <name type="PERSON">Donna</name>

in wardrobe.

</line>


<line>
We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> fix this, buddy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Donna</name>!

</line>


<line>
What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to get inside

my character, which is you.

</line>


<line>
Is this how we move our arms?

</line>


<line>
We're so weird.

</line>


<line>
Is this really necessary?

</line>


<line>
Is this really necessary?

</line>


<line>
That's not what I sound like.

</line>


<line>
That's not mut

mi sound <name type="PERSON">mike</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's it been like

since we got married?

</line>


<line>
Is it everything we dreamed

of since we were little?

</line>


<line>
When I was little,

I dreamed of getting

a MacArthur grant for my 'zine

about how all the girls

at school were bitches.

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- Look, the wedding was great.

</line>


<line>
But that's not real life.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

I guess I got a happy ending,

but every happy ending

has the day after

the happy ending, right?

</line>


<line>
And the day after that.

</line>


<line>
So the wedding was so much f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
It was the happiest day

of my life.

</line>


<line>
But, you know,

what does that say

about all the days

I have left?

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
We're such a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

</line>


<line>
Hold this.

</line>


<line>
Todd, my jacket

is on the floor.

</line>


<line>
You're supposed to hold

the jacket

so it doesn't go on the floor.

</line>


<line>
Hey, sorry, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>--

I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
But I work

for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

</line>


<line>
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe

I'm on a movie set, you know?

</line>


<line>
I mean, this is my first chance

to work on something big

since my rock opera

fell apart.

</line>


<line>
Man, I really messed up

that huge career opportunity

all on my own, didn't I?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

</line>


<line>
Yep.

</line>


<line>
You said it.

</line>


<line>
Well, see you later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[indistinct chatter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Where can I grab a nosh?

</line>


<line>
Oh, craft services

is in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Up the driveway, through

the living room, make a left.

</line>


<line>
- Can't miss it.

- I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> grab a quick bite.

</line>


<line>
Don't do anything stupid

while I'm gone.

</line>


<line>
Okay, fellas, here's the thing

about the story.

</line>


<line>
I don't buy it.

</line>


<line>
It's like something's missing,

but I can't put

any of my fingers on it.

</line>


<line>
Um, maybe once

we add the music--

</line>


<line>
The music?

Are you kidding me?

</line>


<line>
Music?

You're fired.

</line>


<line>
What dumb shit brought

this dumb shit?

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're fired too.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Anyone else

got any bright ideas?

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe it make it

more <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>-y?

</line>


<line>
- Um, excuse me?

- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
This is probably stupid,

but the whole story's

about how this guy's

in love with this lady, right?

</line>


<line>
But we don't even know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> she is or what she wants.

</line>


<line>
I mean, maybe give her

more lines or words

or, I don't know,

feelings or whatever?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
He's new.

He doesn't know the rules.

</line>


<line>
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I love you.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this kid?

</line>


<line>
You're a genius.

</line>


<line>
- I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> kiss your face.

- What?

</line>


<line>
Oh!

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Come back to my web.

</line>


<line>
Let's talk

about <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>'s feelings

and make this baby sing.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Todd, talk to him

about the wardrobe,

specifically the top half

of the wardrobe,

specifically the shirt part

of the top half of the wardrobe,

specifically the neck part of

the shirt part of the wardrobe.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

What now?

</line>


<line>
I'm sick

of this dog and pony show.

</line>


<line>
The movie is dumb.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoying

the shit out of me,

and there's too much honeydew

in the fruit bowl.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Blech</name>. <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>

is garbage fruit.

</line>


<line>
Also, why is <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

being played by an old, <name type="GPE">nebbishy</name>

five-foot-tall bald guy?

</line>


<line>
Is that how the world sees me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I see.

</line>


<line>
So I can play

<ital>Vanya on 42nd Street,</ital>

but I'm not a deft-enough talent

to capture the essence

of the elusive

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
So sorry to offend you, sir.

</line>


<line>
I'm just glad my book's

coming out soon

so people will get

an opportunity to see

the real <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, are you coming out

with a book?

</line>


<line>
You never mentioned it.

</line>


<line>
Plus,

Todd's being super weird.

</line>


<line>
I think he's onto me.

</line>


<line>
Onto you in regards to what?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

</line>


<line>
I sabotaged his rock opera

by getting him readdicted

to a video game because

I didn't want him to move out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I think he knows

and might be plotting

to sabotage me back.

</line>


<line>
Why is it that 90%

of our conversations

these days revolve around

plotting sabotages?

</line>


<line>
Are you saying I should

plot a countersabotage?

</line>


<line>
No, no more plotting.

</line>


<line>
Just be a good soldier

and do your job.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is out to get you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cell phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Have you seen the new draft?

</line>


<line>
They took it all off you

and put it on me.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Apparently some dickweed

named Todd

decided I should be

three-dimensional

and you should have no lines.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Isn't this town sick

of creating

three-dimensional roles

for women?

</line>


<line>
This happens to me

all the time!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">A.O. Scott</name> is sick of talking

about how brilliant I am.

</line>


<line>
Todd.

</line>


<line>
I guess

what I've been saying

for the last

seven uninterrupted minutes is,

how can I forgive my father

if I can't forgive myself?

</line>


<line>
True dat.

</line>


<line>
But none of that matters,

because we bring out

the best in each other.

</line>


<line>
I'm the chocolate,

and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
- True dat.

- <name type="PERSON">Mwah</name>!

</line>


<line>
Cut!

Amazing.

</line>


<line>
This is the movie

that I wanted to make.

</line>


<line>
This is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be great.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm so--

- Ugh, what kind of idiot

puts food on top of a hill?

</line>


<line>
Hey, so I guess now that

the movie's all about <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

</line>


<line>
I really need to dig deep

and get to know the real you.

</line>


<line>
So let's talk and talk

and talk until I am you

and you are nothing

but a hollowed-out husk

of your former self and every

thought and every feeling

you ever had belongs to me

and me alone.

</line>


<line>
So do we like Sprite,

or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

</line>


<line>
Uh, that all sounds great.

</line>


<line>
But, you know, the person

you should really be talking to

is that guy.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.

- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> loves talking to him.

</line>


<line>
They have great rapport.

</line>


<line>
In fact, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> could spend

all day talking to him

and never talk to me again.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get it, because <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>

doesn't talk to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> talks to--

- Anybody else.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Todd,

remember that time

when you wouldn't clean

up your shit?

</line>


<line>
That was hilarious.

</line>


<line>
- We've had some good times.

- Oh. Hi.

</line>


<line>
So I was thinking,

I have some...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> pretty sloppy seconds

left over from <name type="ORG">P.F.</name> Chang's

in the fridge, and I don't think

that I want it anymore.

</line>


<line>
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

</line>


<line>
Friendly gesture

because we're friends.

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- Oh-oh, there's my guy.

</line>


<line>
I heard you had a few more

thoughts about the script.

</line>


<line>
I do.

</line>


<line>
I was just thinking, what if

we made the <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> character

into a real shithead?

</line>


<line>
- Is that really necessary?

- I don't think it's necessary.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, let's-- Let's make him

be a real selfish asshole

so the audience has someone

to root against.

</line>


<line>
You're probably right.

</line>


<line>
Let's take another swing

at the script

and give <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> more to do.

</line>


<line>
Now, when you say,

"Give <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> more to do<name type="PERSON">"-</name>-

</line>


<line>
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
And also,

now that I'm thinking about it,

why does the movie

have to take place on <name type="LOC">Earth</name>?

</line>


<line>
You are blowing my head.

</line>


<line>
- I hope you like Oscars.

- <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>?

</line>


<line>
More like,

"Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

</line>


<line>
Yes, I do." Right?

</line>


<line>
Not right, and I would love to

go through all the reasons why,

but I've got bigger concerns

right now.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>, go on.

- Did you notice

that the Mr. Peanutbutter part

has been cut in half?

</line>


<line>
- What is happening to our movie?

- I thought you hated the movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I do, but if I'm

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be in a dumb movie

</line>


<line>
I hate that makes no sense,

</line>


<line>
I should at least

be the star of it.

</line>


<line>
Look, I agree that this movie

has really lost its way.

</line>


<line>
I mean, first of all,

why would Mr. Peanutbutter

wear a crew neck <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt?

</line>


<line>
And second of all, uh...

</line>


<line>
It's just the shirt,

isn't it?

</line>


<line>
It doesn't make sense.

</line>


<line>
I'm a V-neck man.

</line>


<line>
A V you can put

your <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>glasses in.

</line>


<line>
Can you do

that with a crew neck?

</line>


<line>
Because I'd like

to see you tr--

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bagel</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thanks so much for running

this scene with me.

</line>


<line>
I have so many lines to learn.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, most of my lines

are, "True dat,"

but I guess it never hurts

to practice.

</line>


<line>
The citizens of <name type="LOC">Planet</name> D

want their king back.

</line>


<line>
But I'm more concerned

with getting my self-esteem back

after being in the shadow

of powerful men for so long.

</line>


<line>
True dat.

</line>


<line>
Is it just me,

or is this movie

kind of flying off the rails?

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't want to overuse

my catchphrase here,

but true dat.

</line>


<line>
This is so typical.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to do something

light and f<name type="ORG">un</name>

to distract me from the deep

well of sadness that is my life.

</line>


<line>
You probably

wouldn't understand.

</line>


<line>
Oh, puh-lease.

</line>


<line>
I'm so deep down

a well of sadness

that <name type="PERSON">Baby <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name></name>

is like, "Damn."

</line>


<line>
Shut up and kiss me,

you miserable goof.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Oh. Okay. <name type="PERSON">Mwah</name>.

</line>


<line>
Pop this in a drawer.

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
- [glass shatters]

- This is good, baby.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is amazing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name>, I haven't felt

like this since--

</line>


<line>
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

</line>


<line>
Call me <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay, got my bagel.

</line>


<line>
Now back to work.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys!

</line>


<line>
Wow, wow.

</line>


<line>
So you guys

really hit it off, huh?

</line>


<line>
That's awesome.

</line>


<line>
Want to do some hand stuff

in the bathroom

before we go down to set?

</line>


<line>
You read my mind.

</line>


<line>
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

</line>


<line>
Hey, so I finished the book

and sent the draft

to the publishers.

</line>


<line>
What?

My book is ready?

</line>


<line>
Let me read it.

Can I read it?

</line>


<line>
Call <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>.

</line>


<line>
He'll probably send you a copy

as soon as he's done with it.

</line>


<line>
All right!

You hang tight, baby.

</line>


<line>
I got an instant classic

to read.

</line>


<line>
Keep the engine running, though,

because if I know me,

this book is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give me

a pretty big erection.

</line>


<line>
Okay, enjoy!

Keep an open mind.

</line>


<line>
You'll love it.

It's a work in progress.

</line>


<line>

Hello.

<name type="ORG">Penguin Publishing</name>.

</line>


<line>
Unless this is that loan shark,

in which case,

Johnny's <name type="ORG">House</name> of Noodles.

</line>


<line>
May I interest you

in our bento lunch box?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>, it's me.

</line>


<line>
Let me read the book.

Give me, give me, give me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, now,

I should warn you,

it's not quite what we expected,

but it is good.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you,

this could really sell.

</line>


<line>
I might actually get

to see my kids again.

</line>


<line>
Great.

Send it over.

</line>


<line>
I'll read it right now.

</line>


<line>
All right, I sent it,

but just remember--

</line>


<line>
To set my expectations

sky-high?

</line>


<line>
- Way ahead of you.

- [cell phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
All right, book,

let's see what you got.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, this is you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>One Trick Pony?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"The first time</ital>

<ital>I met <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>he was puking cotton candy</ital>

<ital>off the deck</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>of his lavish house</ital>

<ital>in the Hills,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>the lights of the city</ital>

<ital>twinkling below us.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Make-A-Wish kids</ital>

<ital>will not soon forget</ital>

<ital>the time the great</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>referred to their parents</ital>

<ital>as 'a bunch of used jizz bags.'</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He filled the air with words,</ital>

<ital>terrified of silence,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>as one often is w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is smart</ital>

<line>
<ital>and looked across the water,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and for a moment,</ital>

<ital>he said nothing."</ital>

</line>


<line>
What the shit was that?

</line>


<line>
What the shit is this?

</line>


<line>
It's a phone.

Well, a tiny computer, really.

</line>


<line>
I mean, amazing

what technology can--

</line>


<line>
You were supposed

to ghostwrite my memoir,

but instead you wrote

a story about how you spent

six months with me and saw

what a big, dumb loser I am.

</line>


<line>
Well, I realized

that the best way

to fully capture you,

warts and all--

</line>


<line>
This isn't warts and all.

It's just warts.

</line>


<line>
Where's the all?

</line>


<line>
I come off like a total asshole.

</line>


<line>
You come off

as complex and deeply troubled

but ultimately sympathetic.

</line>


<line>
You might be too close

to see that.

</line>


<line>
There's an entire chapter

about me eating apple fritters.

</line>


<line>
You did go through

that fritter phase.

</line>


<line>
Is this book how you see me?

</line>


<line>
That day we ran errands

together,

</line>


<line>
I thought that we had

a really good time,

but you just wrote

about how I cried

because the dry cleaner

took my head shot down.

</line>


<line>
You were very emotional.

</line>


<line>
They didn't even

replace me with anyone.

</line>


<line>
Now it's just a faded spot

where my face used to be.

</line>


<line>
This will actually do wonders

for your career.

</line>


<line>
Trust me.

</line>


<line>
I mean, you're just

a dumb actor

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> doesn't know anything

about books, right?

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- What?

</line>


<line>
Remember?

From before?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't think you

understand

what's happening here.

</line>


<line>
This is not a casual

conversation between friends.

</line>


<line>
This is your boss

telling his employee

that she did a bad job.

</line>


<line>
- Try again.

- What?

</line>


<line>
Start over, but do it right

this time.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is ever <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see this.

</line>


<line>
- Ugh!

- [cell phone dialing]

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone vibrating]

- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Wayne</name>,

you still work for <ital><name type="ORG">BuzzFeed</name></ital>?

</line>


<line>
Um, yes.

</line>


<line>
'Cause I got something

that's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get you

a shit-ton of hearts or digs

or smileys

or whatever the hell you measure

your journalism with.

</line>


<line>
Curses!

</line>


<line>
My evil plan has been defeated,

but I'll be back.

</line>


<line>
You haven't heard the last

of Evil Emperor

BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
You shot a laser at me!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I'm dead.

</line>


<line>
And so now

that we've escaped

the evil clutches

of the emperor,

</line>


<line>
I'm free to assume

my natural form,

an all-knowing floating orb

of light?

</line>


<line>
True dat.

</line>


<line>
- Cut, cut.

- [buzzer sounds]

</line>


<line>
Come on, guys,

this is ridiculous.

</line>


<line>
Is this even a movie anymore?

</line>


<line>
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, maybe it's

an immersive smartphone app

or a 21st-century approach

to 360-degree media envelopment.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, or maybe it's just,

like, a feeling, you know?

</line>


<line>
- We've got work to do.

- Yeah, yeah.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is so good.

- Oh, this is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be awesome.

</line>


<line>
Yes!

Go, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
Are you just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> leave me

like this?

</line>


<line>
Anyone?

</line>


<line>
Ah!

</line>


<line>
Oh, good.

You're here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hi, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
This whole day's

been a shit show.

</line>


<line>
The book turned out

to be a total hatchet job.

</line>


<line>
The movie's a disaster.

</line>


<line>
But thank <name type="PERSON">God</name> I have one

good thing in my life,

and that's you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I--

</line>


<line>
Please let me say this

before I lose my nerve.

</line>


<line>
I spent 50 years roaming

the countryside

as a wild stallion,

but I am tired of the rodeo,

and I'm finally ready

to saddle up.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>--

</line>


<line>
I guess what I'm trying

to say is,

this mustang wants to rest

his head in the comforts

of your spacious barn.

</line>


<line>
Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
I'm in love with you, <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, they fired me

and replaced me

with a ball on a stick.

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
But look at the bright side.

</line>


<line>
Now you and I can just hang out

and talk about feelings.

</line>


<line>
No, but you're not getting it.

Boys never get it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I was in character

as <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

and as <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

we had a real connection.

</line>


<line>
But now that I'm off the movie,

I'm <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> again,

and <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> is not interested

in <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

she thinks he's kind of gross.

</line>


<line>
So I didn't fall in love

with <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> Watts?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
You fell in love with <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> what?

</line>


<line>
Good-bye, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
See?

Nothing.

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

Why are they packing up?

</line>


<line>
Oh, glad you're here.

This is exciting.

</line>


<line>
Since we last talked,

this film has gone through

</line>


<line>
- so many permutations.

- So many.

</line>


<line>
First, we reimagined

the whole film

as an interactive

social-media experience.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hose are the dumbest words

I've ever heard.

</line>


<line>
I know.

</line>


<line>
So we realized it was actually

more of a floating

art installation,

but that

didn't feel right either.

</line>


<line>
We thought,

is it a high-end perfume?

</line>


<line>
A series of interrelated

fortune cookies?

</line>


<line>
A hat that if you turn it

upside down, it's a boat?

</line>


<line>
- No, it's none of those things.

- Exactly.

</line>


<line>
That's why we finally

settled on this.

</line>


<line>
Voilà!

</line>


<line>
What am I looking at?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm> It is a bimonthly curated

box of snacks.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what that means.

</line>


<line>
I know.

It's confusing.

</line>


<line>
Not the bimonthly

that means twice a month,

the bimonthly that

means every other month,

and each time

it's a different box of snacks.

</line>


<line>
This is the future of cinema.

</line>


<line>
You guys, finally,

my story has been told.

</line>


<line>
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.

[claps hands]

</line>


<line>
Thanks for making

this box of snacks a reality.

</line>


<line>
Let's go home.

</line>


<line>
What the hell happened

to the movie?

</line>


<line>
Shit, there were snacks here

the whole time?

</line>


<line>
Not bad.

</line>


<line>
- Whoa!

- Look, I get it.

</line>


<line>
You destroyed my big chance

at a comeback

as revenge for what I did

to your rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Revenge? Oh, that would have

been such a good idea.

</line>


<line>
Damn it, Todd!

</line>


<line>
Look, I figured out

what you did,

but I've been trying to put it

behind me and do my job.

</line>


<line>
So cutting my part down

was not about revenge?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
And making <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> the villain

of your movie

was not a coded statement

of your feelings about me?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay, great.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm-- I'm glad

we buried the hatchet

and everything's cool.

</line>


<line>
Uh, actually, you know,

everything is not cool.

</line>


<line>
You ruined my rock opera

by using character actress

</line>


<line>
Margo Martindale to trick me

into playing

an addictive video game.

</line>


<line>
And saying it all together

like that,

it all sounds

kind of ludicrous.

</line>


<line>
But still, it was something

I cared about,

and what you did

really hurt me.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

Well, this feels shitty.

</line>


<line>
You sure you don't want to just

get some revenge real quick--

thump me once in the stones

and then we'll be even?

</line>


<line>
I got to go.

</line>


<line>
I've got some artisanal popcorns

to gauge the mouthfeel of.

</line>


<line>
<ital>- </ital>Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
You want an apple fritter?

</line>


<line>
Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, I bet you would.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
I bet you'd like

an apple fritter.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, an apple fritter

would be great.

</line>


<line>
Why? What-- What--

What's happening here?

</line>


<line>
"Five Shocking Facts

From New <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> Book"?

</line>


<line>
No.

No!

</line>


<line>
Um, everyone,

please turn off your Internet.

</line>


<line>
It has gone bad.

</line>


<line>
I repeat,

the Internet has gone foul.

</line>


<line>
- What a loser.

- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

</line>


<line>
Give me your phones.

I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
You have to listen to me.

</line>


<line>
Look at his deep well

of sadness.

</line>


<line>
It's hilarious.

</line>


<line>
Don't look at me.

I'm well-adjusted.

</line>


<line>
- You all want my life.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
Uh, what the hell?

</line>


<line>
I know, I know.

But if you just listen for--

</line>


<line>
You posted your dumb little

book on the Internet.

</line>


<line>
No, I just leaked

the first couple chapters,

and people are already talking

about it.

</line>


<line>
This is wildly unprofessional.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> do you think you are?

</line>


<line>
I know you're mad,

and you have every right to be,

but you got to read

some of these comments.

</line>


<line>
People love you.

</line>


<line>
And they're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> love you

even more

when they read the rest

of my book.

</line>


<line>
- Your book?

- Our book.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> read

that book.

</line>


<line>
How do you still not get that?

</line>


<line>
It is never going

to be published.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I stand by my work.

</line>


<line>
This is a really good book.

</line>


<line>
And if you just give it time,

you'll see.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Maybe you're right.

</line>


<line>
Really?

</line>


<line>
No.

You're fired.
