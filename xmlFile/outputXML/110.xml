<line>
We're very different,

but I think that we bring out

the best in each other.

</line>


<line>
It's like you're c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate

and I'm Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Shut up and kiss me,

you silly goof.

<line>
Welcome back

to <ital><name type="ORG">Excess <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">A <name type="PERSON">Ryan</name> Seacrest <name type="PERSON">T</name>ype</name>,

and I'm visiting the set

</line>


<line>
of <ital>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter's <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo Heist.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm thrilled to be talking

to the star of the film,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man, and his

real life inspiration,

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Am I an inspiration?

</line>


<line>
Well, that depends

on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you define--

</line>


<line>
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I'm just over

the moon to be producing

this movie

about my daring exploit.

</line>


<line>
- Yes, your<ital> </ital>daring exploit.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
It's such a treat to be

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting in my very own <ital><name type="ORG">casa</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And it's an even sweeter treat

to be played by my good <ital><name type="PERSON">amigo--</name></ital>

dare I say best <ital>amigo?</ital>

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u "daren't."

- We're so in t<name type="ORG">un</name>e.

</line>


<line>
We even finish each other's...

sentences.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

</line>


<line>
- It never--

- Happens.

</line>


<line>
Ah, see?

I'm inside him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, you haven't worked

in quite some time.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were dead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u must be so grateful to be

working a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in and also alive,

which, a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were not.

</line>


<line>
How did you get involved

with this?

</line>


<line>
Well--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want me to play

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

in the story he stole from me?

</line>


<line>
I stole the D,

and then he stole

my stealing of it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat makes him an idea thief,

which is much less cool

than a thief thief,

which is what I am

and what he also is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what might help?

</line>


<line>
If you think about this

like a professional

instead of a big titty baby.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his movie is

a huge opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Quentin</name> <name type="PERSON">T</name>arantulino is known

for revitalizing dead careers.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his could do for you

what <ital><name type="FAC">Reservoir Dogs</name></ital>

did for <name type="PERSON">Rin <name type="PERSON">T</name>in <name type="PERSON">T</name>in</name>.

</line>


<line>
But isn't there

any other part?

</line>


<line>
I could play myself.

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s already being

played by <name type="PERSON">Wallace</name> <name type="PERSON">Shawn</name>.

</line>


<line>
What? <name type="PERSON">T</name>he s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt guy

from <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Princess Bride</ital>

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> says "inconceivable"?

</line>


<line>
- Why <name type="PERSON">Wallace</name> <name type="PERSON">Shawn</name>?

- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to play

that boob.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to help

you out, <name type="PERSON">Wally</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> keeps

buying expensive Rothkos.

</line>


<line>
I have a disease.

</line>


<line>
Would you tell an alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>lic

to stop buying alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

<ital><name type="ORG">Black and Blue <name type="ORG">Nu</name>mber 7's</name></ital>

going up for auction next week.

</line>


<line>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</line>


<line>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</line>


<line>
But if you find me in a bathtub

with open wrists tomorrow

and the words "I hate my agent"

smeared across the walls

in blood, you'll know why.

</line>


<line>
So obviously I'm thrilled

to be here, just thrilled.

</line>


<line>
I know you're

just doing your job,

but I live here, and the crew

has been here since 3:00 a.m.,

so I'm a little tired.

</line>


<line>
Cast and crew only.

</line>


<line>
Hey, stranger.

</line>


<line>
Haven't really seen you

since the wedding.

</line>


<line>
Kind of feels like we're

coming back to sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol

</line>


<line>
- after su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er vacation.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'll see you at the pep rally.

</line>


<line>
Hope we don't get Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Kirkman</name>

for trig this year.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe

the cheerleaders don't stuff me

</line>


<line>
in a locker and write

"virgin slut" on my forehead,

and then when I ask <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

I could be both a virgin

and a slut,

they make me eat a lipstick.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
So what have you been up to

these last couple months?

</line>


<line>
Well, I've been pretty busy.

Met a girl at <name type="ORG">So<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> <name type="ORG">House</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Was she your waitress?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I met a girl at <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>stro's.

</line>


<line>
- Was she also your waitress?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I met a girl

at P.F. Chang's.

</line>


<line>
Let me guess.

She was your--

</line>


<line>
A <name type="PERSON">ho</name>oker, yes,

but what she really wants to do

</line>


<line>
- is wait tables.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
Well, I, for one,

would love to meet

the aspiring food-service worker

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> finally gets you

to settle down.

</line>


<line>
What?

Why would I want to settle down?

</line>


<line>
I'm 50.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, anyway...

- So I'm sending the first draft

of the book to <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>

this afternoon.

</line>


<line>
- What? It's done?

- Not yet. Almost.

</line>


<line>
I'm excited for you to read it,

</line>


<line>
but I'm also

cripplingly nervous.

</line>


<line>
I actually kind of feel

like throwing up,

</line>


<line>
but I can't throw up because

I haven't had anything to eat

because this lady won't let me

in my own kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Cast and crew only.

</line>


<line>
Listen, if reading a book

you wrote is anywhere near

</line>


<line>
as great as it is

to actually spend time with you,

</line>


<line>
I'm sure

it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be wonderful.

</line>


<line>
Having said that,

what do I know about books?

</line>


<line>
I'm just a dumb actor.

</line>


<line>
I'm here with <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo darling

<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> Watts.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me, what attracted you

to the role of <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

</line>


<line>
I just keep getting

pigeon<name type="PERSON">ho</name>led

</line>


<line>
as these complex characters

in highly acclaimed movies.

</line>


<line>
For once, I would just love

to p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne it in

</line>


<line>
and play a two-dimensional girl

in a rom com

</line>


<line>
with no inner life of her own.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's kind of the reason

I got into this business.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said words.

</line>


<line>
Now, is it true you stay

in character between takes?

</line>


<line>
Oh, we all do.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he director insists upon it.

</line>


<line>
He even has everyone

calling me <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane

to help me get

in the headspace.

</line>


<line>
It's been great.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, looking good.

</line>


<line>
- Um, thanks.

- Ugh, not you.

</line>


<line>
I was talking to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
Now, where's my peanut butter?

</line>


<line>
Right over here, Q.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm looking

for peanut butter.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you mean <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
If I wanted <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

I would call <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d someone call for <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
It really cuts

down on confusion.

</line>


<line>
Ah, s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w business,

the great equalizer.

</line>


<line>
Is that what it is?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, spritz me.

</line>


<line>
- Spritzing.

- Mm, <name type="PERSON">mm</name>, <name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well spritzed.

</line>


<line>
Have you ever been

on a movie set before?

</line>


<line>
No, sir, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Please, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

was my father's name.

</line>


<line>
- Uh--

- And it's also my name!

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Ooh, speaking

of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

</line>


<line>
I'll be back

in a jiff, skippy.

</line>


<line>
Keep that air spritzed for me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Aloha</name>, <ital>kemosabe.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, allow me to put

on my producer hat

and produce you

just for one <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond here.

</line>


<line>
I have a few notes

on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you're playing me.

</line>


<line>
Let's see.

[hu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing]

</line>


<line>
Problems, problems, problems,

ah, here we go.

</line>


<line>
I find it really troubling

that my movie self

is wearing a crew neck <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt.

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
I only wear V-necks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u see the problem.

</line>


<line>
- I do not.

- I just think if we're telling

the story, we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld tell it

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w it really happened.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le story

isn't <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w it really happened.

</line>


<line>
Right...

because of the shirts.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> stole the D.

</line>


<line>
I'm the real hero here.

</line>


<line>
My life is full

of exciting adventures.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld write a book.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait.

I did.

</line>


<line>
Suck on that, society.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you're in a mood.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps the tightness

of that crew neck

is cutting off circulation

to the brain?

</line>


<line>
Let me talk to <name type="PERSON">Donna</name>

in wardrobe.

</line>


<line>
We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> fix this, buddy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Donna</name>!

</line>


<line>
What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to get inside

my character, which is you.

</line>


<line>
Is this <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w we move our arms?

</line>


<line>
We're so weird.

</line>


<line>
Is this really necessary?

</line>


<line>
Is this really necessary?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not what I so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not mut

mi so<name type="ORG">un</name>d <name type="PERSON">mike</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's it been like

since we got married?

</line>


<line>
Is it everything we dreamed

of since we were little?

</line>


<line>
When I was little,

I dreamed of getting

a <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>cArthur grant for my 'zine

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w all the girls

at sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol were bitches.

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, the wedding was great.

</line>


<line>
But that's not real life.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

I guess I got a happy ending,

but every happy ending

has the day after

the happy ending, right?

</line>


<line>
And the day after that.

</line>


<line>
So the wedding was so much f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
It was the happiest day

of my life.

</line>


<line>
But, you know,

what does that say

about all the days

I have left?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a.

</line>


<line>
We're such a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, glad you're here.

</line>


<line>
Hold this.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, my <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et

is on the floor.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're supposed to <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld

the <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et

so it doesn't go on the floor.

</line>


<line>
Hey, sorry, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>--

I mean, uh, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
But I work

for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter now.

</line>


<line>
- I mean, uh, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe

I'm on a movie set, you know?

</line>


<line>
I mean, this is my first chance

to work on something big

since my rock opera

fell apart.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>n, I really messed up

that huge career opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity

all on my own, didn't I?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

</line>


<line>
Yep.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said it.

</line>


<line>
Well, see you later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[indistinct chatter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Where can I grab a nosh?

</line>


<line>
Oh, craft services

is in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Up the driveway, through

the living room, make a left.

</line>


<line>
- Can't miss it.

- I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> grab a quick bite.

</line>


<line>
Don't do anything stupid

while I'm gone.

</line>


<line>
Okay, fellas, here's the thing

about the story.

</line>


<line>
I don't buy it.

</line>


<line>
It's like something's missing,

but I can't put

any of my fingers on it.

</line>


<line>
Um, maybe once

we add the music--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he music?

Are you kidding me?

</line>


<line>
Music?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're fired.

</line>


<line>
What dumb shit brought

this dumb shit?

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're fired too.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Anyone else

got any bright ideas?

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe it make it

more <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane-y?

</line>


<line>
- Um, excuse me?

- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is probably stupid,

but the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le story's

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w this guy's

in love with this lady, right?

</line>


<line>
But we don't even know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> she is or what she wants.

</line>


<line>
I mean, maybe give her

more lines or words

or, I don't know,

feelings or whatever?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
He's new.

He doesn't know the rules.

</line>


<line>
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I love you.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this kid?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a genius.

</line>


<line>
- I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> kiss your face.

- What?

</line>


<line>
Oh!

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Come back to my web.

</line>


<line>
Let's talk

about <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane's feelings

and make this baby sing.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, talk to him

about the wardrobe,

specifically the top half

of the wardrobe,

specifically the shirt part

of the top half of the wardrobe,

specifically the neck part of

the shirt part of the wardrobe.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[cell p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne rings]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

What now?

</line>


<line>
I'm sick

of this dog and pony s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he movie is dumb.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter is annoying

the shit out of me,

and there's too much <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew

in the fruit bowl.

</line>


<line>
Blech. <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>

is <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rbage fruit.

</line>


<line>
Also, why is <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>

being played by an old, <name type="GPE">nebbishy</name>

five-foot-tall bald guy?

</line>


<line>
Is that <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w the world sees me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I see.

</line>


<line>
So I can play

<ital><name type="PERSON">Vanya</name> on <name type="FAC">42nd Street</name>,</ital>

but I'm not a deft-enough talent

to capture the essence

of the elusive

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
So sorry to offend you, sir.

</line>


<line>
I'm just glad my book's

coming out soon

so people will get

an opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity to see

the real <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
Oh, are you coming out

with a book?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u never mentioned it.

</line>


<line>
Plus,

<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's being super weird.

</line>


<line>
I think he's onto me.

</line>


<line>
Onto you in re<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rds to what?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

</line>


<line>
I sabotaged his rock opera

by getting him readdicted

to a video <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me because

I didn't want him to move out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I think he knows

and might be plotting

to sabotage me back.

</line>


<line>
Why is it that 90%

of our conversations

these days revolve aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

plotting sabotages?

</line>


<line>
Are you saying I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld

plot a co<name type="ORG">un</name>tersabotage?

</line>


<line>
No, no more plotting.

</line>


<line>
Just be a good soldier

and do your job.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is out to get you.

<line>
Have you seen the new draft?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey took it all off you

and put it on me.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Apparently some dickweed

named <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd

decided I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be

three-dimensional

and you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have no lines.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Isn't this town sick

of creating

three-dimensional roles

for women?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his happens to me

all the time!

</line>


<line>
A.O. Scott is sick of talking

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w brilliant I am.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
I guess

what I've been saying

for the last

seven <name type="ORG">un</name>interrupted minutes is,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w can I forgive my father

if I can't forgive myself?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue dat.

</line>


<line>
But none of that matters,

because we bring out

the best in each other.

</line>


<line>
I'm the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>colate,

and you're Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter!

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>rue dat.

- <name type="PERSON">Mwah</name>!

</line>


<line>
Cut!

Amazing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is the movie

that I wanted to make.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be great.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I'm so--

- Ugh, what kind of idiot

puts food on top of a hill?

</line>


<line>
Hey, so I guess now that

the movie's all about <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

</line>


<line>
I really need to dig deep

and get to know the real you.

</line>


<line>
So let's talk and talk

and talk <name type="ORG">un</name>til I am you

and you are nothing

but a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>llowed-out husk

of your former self and every

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught and every feeling

you ever had belongs to me

and me alone.

</line>


<line>
So do we like Sprite,

or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

</line>


<line>
Uh, that all so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great.

</line>


<line>
But, you know, the person

you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld really be talking to

is that guy.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.

- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane loves talking to him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey have great rapport.

</line>


<line>
In fact, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane could spend

all day talking to him

and never talk to me a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get it, because <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane

doesn't talk to <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane talks to--

- Anybody else.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd,

remember that time

when you wouldn't clean

up your shit?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was hilarious.

</line>


<line>
- We've had some good times.

- Oh. Hi.

</line>


<line>
So I was thinking,

I have some...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> pretty sloppy <name type="ORG">sec</name>onds

left over from P.F. Chang's

in the fridge, and I don't think

that I want it anymore.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe tonight you could eat it.

</line>


<line>
Friendly gesture

because we're friends.

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- Oh-oh, there's my guy.

</line>


<line>
I heard you had a few more

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughts about the script.

</line>


<line>
I do.

</line>


<line>
I was just thinking, what if

we made the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> character

into a real shithead?

</line>


<line>
- Is that really necessary?

- I don't think it's necessary.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, let's-- Let's make him

be a real selfish ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

so the audience has someone

to root a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're probably right.

</line>


<line>
Let's take another swing

at the script

and give <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> more to do.

</line>


<line>
Now, when you say,

"Give <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> more to do<name type="PERSON">"-</name>-

</line>


<line>
Not now, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
And also,

now that I'm thinking about it,

why does the movie

have to take place on <name type="LOC">Earth</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are blowing my head.

</line>


<line>
- I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe you like <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>s.

- <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>re like,

"Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

</line>


<line>
Yes, I do." Right?

</line>


<line>
Not right, and I would love to

go through all the reasons why,

but I've got bigger concerns

right now.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="GPE">Honeydew</name>, go on.

- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you notice

that the Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter part

has been cut in half?

</line>


<line>
- What is happening to our movie?

- I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you hated the movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I do, but if I'm

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be in a dumb movie

</line>


<line>
I hate that makes no sense,

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld at least

be the star of it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I agree that this movie

has really lost its way.

</line>


<line>
I mean, first of all,

why would Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

wear a crew neck <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt?

</line>


<line>
And <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond of all, uh...

</line>


<line>
It's just the shirt,

isn't it?

</line>


<line>
It doesn't make sense.

</line>


<line>
I'm a V-neck man.

</line>


<line>
A V you can put

your <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>glasses in.

</line>


<line>
Can you do

that with a crew neck?

</line>


<line>
Because I'd like

to see you tr--

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks so much for r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning

this scene with me.

</line>


<line>
I have so many lines to learn.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, most of my lines

are, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue dat,"

but I guess it never hurts

to practice.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he citizens of <name type="LOC">Planet</name> D

want their king back.

</line>


<line>
But I'm more concerned

with getting my self-esteem back

after being in the shadow

of powerful men for so long.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue dat.

</line>


<line>
Is it just me,

or is this movie

kind of flying off the rails?

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't want to overuse

my catchphrase here,

but true dat.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is so typical.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to do something

light and f<name type="ORG">un</name>

to distract me from the deep

well of sadness that is my life.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u probably

wouldn't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
Oh, puh-lease.

</line>


<line>
I'm so deep down

a well of sadness

that <name type="PERSON">Baby <name type="PERSON">Jessica</name></name>

is like, "Damn."

</line>


<line>
Shut up and kiss me,

you miserable goof.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Oh. Okay. <name type="PERSON">Mwah</name>.

</line>


<line>
Pop this in a drawer.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
- [glass shatters]

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is good, baby.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is amazing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name>, I haven't felt

like this since--

</line>


<line>
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

</line>


<line>
Call me <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Okay, got my bagel.

</line>


<line>
Now back to work.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys!

</line>


<line>
Wow, wow.

</line>


<line>
So you guys

really hit it off, huh?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's awesome.

</line>


<line>
Want to do some hand stuff

in the bathroom

before we go down to set?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u read my mind.

</line>


<line>
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

</line>


<line>
Hey, so I finished the book

and sent the draft

to the publishers.

</line>


<line>
What?

My book is ready?

</line>


<line>
Let me read it.

Can I read it?

</line>


<line>
Call <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name>.

</line>


<line>
He'll probably send you a copy

as soon as he's done with it.

</line>


<line>
All right!

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u hang tight, baby.

</line>


<line>
I got an instant classic

to read.

</line>


<line>
Keep the engine r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh,

because if I know me,

this book is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give me

a pretty big erection.

</line>


<line>
Okay, enjoy!

Keep an open mind.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u'll love it.

It's a work in progress.

</line>

Great.

Send it over.

</line>


<line>
What the shit was that?

</line>


<line>
What the shit is this?

</line>


<line>
It's a p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne.

Well, a tiny computer, really.

</line>


<line>
I mean, amazing

what technology can--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were supposed

to g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>stwrite my memoir,

but instead you wrote

a story about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you spent

six months with me and saw

what a big, dumb loser I am.

</line>


<line>
Well, I realized

that the best way

to fully capture you,

warts and all--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his isn't warts and all.

It's just warts.

</line>


<line>
Where's the all?

</line>


<line>
I come off like a total ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u come off

as complex and deeply troubled

but ultimately sympathetic.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u might be too close

to see that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's an entire chapter

about me eating apple fritters.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did go through

that fritter phase.

</line>


<line>
Is this book <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you see me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat day we ran errands

together,

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught that we had

a really good time,

but you just wrote

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I cried

because the dry cleaner

took my head s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t down.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were very emotional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey didn't even

replace me with anyone.

</line>


<line>
Now it's just a faded spot

where my face used to be.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his will actually do wonders

for your career.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rust me.

</line>


<line>
I mean, you're just

a dumb actor

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> doesn't know anything

about books, right?

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- What?

</line>


<line>
Remember?

From before?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't think you

<name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

what's happening here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not a casual

conversation between friends.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is your boss

telling his employee

that she did a bad job.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>ry a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

- What?

</line>


<line>
Start over, but do it right

this time.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is ever <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see this.

</line>


<line>
- Ugh!

Hey, <name type="PERSON">Wayne</name>,

you still work for <ital><name type="ORG">BuzzFeed</name></ital>?

</line>


<line>
Um, yes.

</line>


<line>
'Cause I got something

that's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get you

a shit-ton of hearts or digs

or smileys

or whatever the hell you measure

your journalism with.

<line>

<line>
My evil plan has been defeated,

but I'll be back.

of Evil Emperor

<line>
Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no!

I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I'm dead.

</line>


<line>
And so now

that we've escaped

the evil clutches

of the emperor,

</line>


<line>
I'm free to assume

my natural form,

an all-knowing floating orb

of light?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue dat.

<line>
- Cut, cut.

</line>


<line>
Come on, guys,

this is ridiculous.

</line>


<line>
Is this even a movie anymore?

</line>


<line>
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, maybe it's

an i<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ersive smartp<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne app

or a 21st-century approach

to 360-degree media envelopment.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, or maybe it's just,

like, a feeling, you know?

</line>


<line>
- We've got work to do.

- Yeah, yeah.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is so good.

- Oh, this is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be awesome.

</line>


<line>
Yes!

Go, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
Hello?

</line>


<line>
Are you just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> leave me

like this?

</line>


<line>
Anyone?

</line>


<line>
Ah!

</line>


<line>
Oh, good.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hi, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le day's

been a shit s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he book turned out

to be a total hatchet job.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he movie's a disaster.

</line>


<line>
But thank <name type="PERSON">God</name> I have one

good thing in my life,

and that's you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I--

</line>


<line>
Please let me say this

before I lose my nerve.

</line>


<line>
I spent 50 years roaming

the co<name type="ORG">un</name>tryside

as a wild stallion,

but I am tired of the rodeo,

and I'm finally ready

to saddle up.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>--

</line>


<line>
I guess what I'm trying

to say is,

this mustang wants to rest

his head in the comforts

of your spacious barn.

</line>


<line>
Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
I'm in love with you, <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, they fired me

and replaced me

with a ball on a stick.

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
But look at the bright side.

</line>


<line>
Now you and I can just hang out

and talk about feelings.

</line>


<line>
No, but you're not getting it.

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ys never get it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I was in character

as <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

and as <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane,

we had a real connection.

</line>


<line>
But now that I'm off the movie,

I'm <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

and <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> is not interested

in <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

she thinks he's kind of gross.

</line>


<line>
So I didn't fall in love

with <name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> Watts?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u fell in love with <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Naomi</name> what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d-bye, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
See?

Nothing.

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

Why are they packing up?

</line>


<line>
Oh, glad you're here.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is exciting.

</line>


<line>
Since we last talked,

this film has gone through

</line>


<line>
- so many permutations.

- So many.

</line>


<line>
First, we reimagined

the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le film

as an interactive

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se are the dumbest words

I've ever heard.

</line>


<line>
I know.

</line>


<line>
So we realized it was actually

more of a floating

art installation,

but that

didn't feel right either.

</line>


<line>
We t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

is it a high-end perfume?

</line>


<line>
A series of interrelated

fort<name type="ORG">un</name>e cookies?

</line>


<line>
A hat that if you turn it

upside down, it's a boat?

</line>


<line>
- No, it's none of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se things.

- Exactly.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why we finally

settled on this.

</line>


<line>
Voilà!

</line>


<line>
What am I looking at?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> It is a bimonthly curated

box of snacks.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what that means.

</line>


<line>
I know.

It's confusing.

</line>


<line>
Not the bimonthly

that means twice a month,

the bimonthly that

means every other month,

and each time

it's a different box of snacks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is the future of cinema.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u guys, finally,

my story has been told.

</line>


<line>
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.

[claps hands]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for making

this box of snacks a reality.

</line>


<line>
Let's go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
What the hell happened

to the movie?

</line>


<line>
Shit, there were snacks here

the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time?

</line>


<line>
Not bad.

</line>


<line>
- W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a!

- <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I get it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u destroyed my big chance

at a comeback

as revenge for what I did

to your rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Revenge? Oh, that would have

been such a good idea.

</line>


<line>
Damn it, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I figured out

what you did,

but I've been trying to put it

behind me and do my job.

</line>


<line>
So cutting my part down

was not about revenge?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
And making <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> the villain

of your movie

was not a coded statement

of your feelings about me?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay, great.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm-- I'm glad

we buried the hatchet

and everything's cool.

</line>


<line>
Uh, actually, you know,

everything is not cool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u ruined my rock opera

by using character actress

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rgo <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rtindale to trick me

into playing

an addictive video <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me.

</line>


<line>
And saying it all together

like that,

it all so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds

kind of ludicrous.

</line>


<line>
But still, it was something

I cared about,

and what you did

really hurt me.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

Well, this feels shitty.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure you don't want to just

get some revenge real quick--

thump me once in the stones

and then we'll be even?

</line>


<line>
I got to go.

</line>


<line>
I've got some artisanal popcorns

to <name type="PERSON">ga</name>uge the mouthfeel of.

</line>


<line>
<ital>- </ital>Hey, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want an apple fritter?

</line>


<line>
Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, I bet you would.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
I bet you'd like

an apple fritter.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, an apple fritter

would be great.

</line>


<line>
Why? What-- What--

What's happening here?

</line>


<line>
"Five S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>cking Facts

From New <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ok"?

</line>


<line>
No.

No!

</line>


<line>
Um, everyone,

please turn off your Internet.

</line>


<line>
It has gone bad.

</line>


<line>
I repeat,

the Internet has gone foul.

</line>


<line>
- What a loser.

- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

</line>


<line>
Give me your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>nes.

I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have to listen to me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at his deep well

of sadness.

</line>


<line>
It's hilarious.

</line>


<line>
Don't look at me.

I'm well-adjusted.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u all want my life.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
Uh, what the hell?

</line>


<line>
I know, I know.

But if you just listen for--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u posted your dumb little

book on the Internet.

</line>


<line>
No, I just leaked

the first couple chapters,

and people are already talking

about it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is wildly <name type="ORG">un</name>professional.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> do you think you are?

</line>


<line>
I know you're mad,

and you have every right to be,

but you got to read

some of these co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ents.

</line>


<line>
People love you.

</line>


<line>
And they're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> love you

even more

when they read the rest

of my book.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur book?

- Our book.

</line>


<line>
Nobody is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> read

that book.

</line>


<line>
How do you still not get that?

</line>


<line>
It is never going

to be published.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I stand by my work.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a really good book.

</line>


<line>
And if you just give it time,

you'll see.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you're right.

</line>


<line>
Really?

</line>


<line>
No.
