<line>
<nonVerbComm>[jazz music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I think, the most important thing here

is that we're honest with each other

and ourselves. Do you agree?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yes?

</line>


<line>
It says, here, you failed

your last six health inspections.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh.

-How are you still in business?

</line>


<line>
I wanna say moxie?

But possibly sp<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I can't believe

I fell asleep at your house.

</line>


<line>
-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.

-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit

of spending the night or day.

</line>


<line>
I get it. We work together,

we make sex together,

we don't talk about feelings,

and yet sometimes

a begrudging respect can blossom into--

</line>


<line>
-Nope.

-"Blossoms into nothing"

is what I was gonna say.

</line>


<line>
You cut me off, so you look stupid.

</line>


<line>
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.

Look, I took some dumb pictures.

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack] All right.

-Stupid. Real stupid.

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack] You can delete some.

-You have a weird eye.

</line>


<line>
-Obsessed much?

-This is what it would look like

if corpses could drool. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
-Hi, excuse me, can I get <ital>The BoJack?</ital>

-What is that?

</line>


<line>
It's an off-the-menu item

for those in the know.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, I'm BoJack

and I always order the BoJack sandwich.

</line>


<line>
That's kooky.

</line>


<line>
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

</line>


<line>
Because I own this restaurant

and I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
So, are all sandwiches named

after celebrities?

</line>


<line>
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

</line>


<line>
No, that's just a thing

they put in the sandwich.

</line>


<line>
That's not someone's name.

</line>


<line>
Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I'll have a burger.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'm going to the can.

Have f<name type="ORG">un</name> with the waitress.

</line>


<line>
-[water r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning]

-[humming rhythmically]

</line>


<line>
-Um.

-It's me, Pickles, from before.

</line>


<line>
-It's cool dating a celebrity.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm also dating a celebrity.

Should we start a club?

</line>


<line>
-I call vice president.

-I'm not dating anyone.

</line>


<line>
And if I had to guess,

I'd say neither are you.

</line>


<line>
Guys in this town, especially celebrities,

are not exactly the settle-down type.

</line>


<line>
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.

He doesn't have a problem committing.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

he just got out of his third marriage.

</line>


<line>
A celebrity who just got divorced.

Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

</line>


<line>
Do you think Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> and I

are moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
I don't know you or your relationship,

but I have been aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the block

a few times.

</line>


<line>
I was even on an <name type="ORG">ABC</name> procedural,

called <ital>The Block,</ital> which aired a few times.

</line>


<line>
The key is to have zero expectations,

and then you'll never be disappointed.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, zero expectations,

which also seems to be the mantra

of this restaurant.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
She looks dead.

</line>


<line>
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.

</line>


<line>
Poor girl had dreams.

</line>


<line>
And there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</line>


<line>
Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette,

then kneels down to inspect the corpse.

</line>


<line>
-[Flip] Cut!

-[buzzer buzzes]

</line>


<line>
BoJack,

you said the stage directions again.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.

It's these night shoots.

</line>


<line>
I think it works.

</line>


<line>
John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.

He says his stage directions out loud.

</line>


<line>
It's confusing, which means

the show is daring and smart.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?

-Mm-mm.

</line>


<line>
How could whatever you're listening to

be more f<name type="ORG">un</name>

</line>


<line>
than hearing me rant

about the fruit spread?

</line>


<line>
Is your rant honeydew related?

</line>


<line>
It's in the honeydew area,

but the specifics are

what keep it fresh each time.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
-[joyful music]

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Are you ready to go?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.

</line>


<line>
If only there was an easy way

</line>


<line>
to keep track

of what time it is right now.

</line>


<line>
-I'll go change.

-No, keep your suit on.

</line>


<line>
My parents are gonna be impressed

I'm dating an executive.

</line>


<line>
Cool!

I've never impressed parents before.

</line>


<line>
I believe that.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I haven't told my family

I'm asexual,

so it might be best if, for tonight,

we just pretend we're sexually active.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's a family dinner.

</line>


<line>
What are the odds they're going to ask

questions about our sexuality, right?

</line>


<line>
Right...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mystery music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
Yeah...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-[Pickles] Hmm.

-Aha! Whoa. Slow down.

</line>


<line>
-Stop. We're here.

-Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>?

</line>


<line>
Am I Steve Carell taking a dramatic role

in <ital>Little Miss S<name type="ORG">un</name>shine,</ital>

and you are the <name type="GPE">America</name>n public

that only knows him for his comedic work?

</line>


<line>
Because... surprise!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. Are you the umlaut

in Chloë Sevigny's name, right now?

</line>


<line>
Because I don't know why you're here,

but I'm glad you are.

</line>


<line>
As <name type="ORG">Court</name>eney Cox said when she discovered

a rotting corpse in the woods

</line>


<line>
near the <ital>Cougar Town </ital>set,

"Good God, I hope you're not busy."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-This is a thinker.

</line>


<line>
-You'll get it later.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I have a very f<name type="ORG">un</name> plan for tonight.

</line>


<line>
I just heard that they're going to blow up

the <name type="FAC">International Space Station</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God. Blow it up? Why?

-No one knows why space people do things.

</line>


<line>
But I thought we could road trip

out to the desert

and witness the explosion

in all her glory.

</line>


<line>
That so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds amazing!

</line>


<line>
I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,

and not mad at me

for trying to surprise you

with something nice.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
A wise lady, in the bathroom,

told me some stuff.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, she so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds smart. Better listen.

-I think her name was Hamburger.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we should wait, some days,

before going on another date.

</line>


<line>
Okay. If that's how you feel,

you stay here and do nothing,

and I'll go have this amazing,

once-in-a-lifetime experience

all by myself.

</line>


<line>
It does so<name type="ORG">un</name>d cool.

I could also drive to the desert.

</line>


<line>
If we're both going,

we might as well carpool.

</line>


<line>
That's smart! But just to be clear,

we're slowing things down.

</line>


<line>
It's not a date.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Exactly.

</line>


<line>
Is this that mysterious,

brown hors d'oeuvre

</line>


<line>
I ate at Mark McGrath's pool party,

last week?

</line>


<line>
Because... oh, boy. Not a date.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
...and finally, <name type="ORG">Carnegie</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thus, concludes the two-item list

of acceptable melons.

</line>


<line>
-[humming rhythmically]

-Always with the earbuds.

</line>


<line>
What are you listening to?

</line>


<line>
-Hey! No... Ugh!

-[musical playing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> What is this?

</line>


<line>
-This is so corny.

-It's not corny.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

it's technically a musical about corn,

but it's actually sophisticated.

</line>


<line>
Wait a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond.

Are you... into musicals?

</line>


<line>
I sense you'll make this a thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic,

who thinks feelings are for suckers,

has a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret soft spot for sappy musicals.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-When you say, "Okay,"

do you mean okay like "correct,"

or okay like "OK-lahoma"?

</line>


<line>
-<ital><music>♪ <name type="GPE">Oklahoma</name> ♪</music></ital>

-All right.

</line>


<line>
Step-ball-change, step-ball-change,

shuffle off to <name type="GPE">Buffalo</name>, and big finish.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, watch out!

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
-[Gina] Ah... oh, God.

-Ouch! God damn it!

</line>


<line>
Once again, my life has been worsened

by a brush with musical theater.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ Oh, yes, it's true</ital>

<ital>I'm feeling so romantic ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
Driver, can you put on

something less romantic?

</line>


<line>
I have a podcast

about the space station explosion.

</line>


<line>
Oh, good idea!

Nothing is less romantic than learning.

You got it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[DJ]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Coming up, we got a brand-new single</ital>

<ital>from Twenty-One Pilots.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ew, back to the podcast.

</line>


<line>
-Todd is the president of ad sales.

-Mm, look at you.

</line>


<line>
-And he went to a really good college.

-I did?

</line>


<line>
That's very impressive.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid we don't know a lot

about the world of big business.

</line>


<line>
As I'm sure Yolanda has told you,

</line>


<line>
I'm but a humble,

best-selling, erotic novelist

and my wife is a world-famous,

adult, film star,

and Yolanda's identical twin sister,

Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.

</line>


<line>
Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.

</line>


<line>
That's all really great information,

that I was already privy to.

</line>


<line>
Well, the important thing is

that Yolanda is happy

and she's finally fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d a man, woman,

or object to have sex with.

</line>


<line>
Todd is very accomplished

at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, Todd?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.

Hooba, hooba.

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
You know, Todd, I have a bit

of a reputation, myself. [moans]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Okay, we should be hitting the road.

</line>


<line>
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.

</line>


<line>
You know, I saw the erotic dessert

in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Who knew you could make

such a realistic anus out of <name type="GPE">marzipan</name>?

</line>


<line>
You can thank my husband.

He posed for the baker.

</line>


<line>
Wow, you know,

it really puts the "um" in "yum."

</line>


<line>
I insist you spend the night

and make love in my home.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-I can't think of a reason,

you wouldn't want to have sex

in your parents' house.

</line>


<line>
Unless, you don't enjoy sex.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sudden so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No! Of course we'll spend the night,

and... fornicate.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene

where you make your big confession.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah?

-I was thinking you could maybe confess...

</line>

<ital><music>♪ ...in song! ♪</music></ital>

</line>

-Whoa, hey!

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, shut up and get in here.

-Okay, look at that! Fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d an emotion.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna tell you

something very personal.

</line>


<line>
When I was a little girl, my mom took me

to see <ital>A Kernel of Truth</ital> on <name type="FAC">Broadway</name>.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a big hit.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know. I <name type="ORG">Google</name>d the reviews

so I could mock you.

</line>


<line>
That Frank Rich could be

a real frank bitch, am I right?

</line>


<line>
Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

</line>


<line>
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,

getting to sing on <name type="FAC">Broadway</name>.

</line>


<line>
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

</line>


<line>
So now I get steady TV work,

which is fine, and I'm fine,

but I still listen to that musical

because it reminds me of a time

when I was less jaded,

when I believed I could do anything,

and that makes me feel good.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, Gina.

</line>


<line>
I-I didn't realize how much

this musical meant to you.

</line>


<line>
-And that... that's even f<name type="ORG">un</name>nier!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Oh, come on!

</line>


<line>
You know if this were reversed,

you'd be giving me shit.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, Gina, I'm sorry. I was just teasing.

I was... It was... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Gina, come out of the bathroom.

</line>


<line>

<ital>Seems like overreaction.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Oh, thank you!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Okay, we're gonna take a break.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm getting kinda h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry.

</line>


<line>
We could stop at a restaurant,

but that's kind of a date thing.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
-Look, there's a <name type="ORG">KFC</name> at the next exit.

-Perfect.

<nonVerbComm>[piano music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>

<line>
-Hon hon hon!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas

your dad gave me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.

</line>


<line>
Is it just me

or was your sister flirting with me?

</line>


<line>
Ugh, when we were in high school,

</line>


<line>
I was still trying to figure out

my sexuality,

so, I dressed as Mindy,

and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

but Mindy fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out,

and now that I have a boyfriend,

she probably wants to have sex with you

to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

</line>


<line>
I thought sisters were doing it

for themselves.

</line>


<line>
I mean, what does she need me for?

</line>


<line>
-[knocking]

-Todd,

can you help me move some furniture?

My husband has a hernia.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, no, I noticed in the <name type="GPE">marzipan</name>.

</line>


<line>
So, what, uh,

furniture do you want me to--

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-Oh, no! Your garment fell.

</line>


<line>
This must be so embarrassing for you.

</line>


<line>
Just as I suspected.

You're not sexual at all.

</line>


<line>
Like, heck I'm not.

</line>


<line>
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused

by the body that starred in every single

porn version of a John Hughes movie:

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, quick update.

</line>


<line>
Mindy wants to meet me

for backyard sex at midnight,

and your mother knows I'm asexual.

</line>


<line>
She showed me her boobs.

</line>


<line>
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"

</line>


<line>
Oh, I didn't!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! She'll disown me!

We gotta convince her you're super horny.

</line>


<line>
-How?

-If Mindy told my mom

that you made a pass at her,

that would prove you're not asexual.

</line>


<line>
Here's the plan.

We'll wait <name type="ORG">un</name>til the cock crows midnight.

</line>


<line>
Who is this cock?

</line>


<line>
When she's at the backyard,

</line>


<line>
I'll sneak in her room

and wear her clothes.

</line>


<line>
I'll pretend I'm Mindy

and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, this so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds a little complicated,

but I think I can handle

exactly this amo<name type="ORG">un</name>t of complication

as long as things don't become

one bit more complicated.

</line>


<line>
-[musical playing over earbuds]

-Hey, I'm sorry I made f<name type="ORG">un</name> of your dream.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> It's okay.

Just don't tell anyone about it.

</line>


<line>
Good news; too late.

I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn

about how you're

into this <name type="FAC">Broadway</name> crap...

</line>


<line>
-What?

-...and they said maybe you can sing

in the nightclub episode.

Can you believe it?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God.

-It's your big break, and I helped!

</line>


<line>
I don't want help.

Why would you do that?

</line>


<line>
I know you don't want me

doing nice things

because I'm not your boyfriend,

and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

but they want to hear you sing

at the next break.

<line>
Here's a song!

You're used to being the star,

so good things always happen to you.

</line>


<line>
I'm not the star.

</line>


<line>
I'm the third on the call sheet

for <ital><name type="ORG">Murder Hospital</name>,</ital>

or <ital>Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,

</line>


<line>
I can get a<ital> </ital>juicy season arc

on the right cable show

where everyone goes,

"Who's this 60-year-old woman?

</line>


<line>
She came out of nowhere."

Then I win an Emmy in a movie

where I play Benjamin <name type="ORG">Bratt</name>'s mother.

</line>


<line>
Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is,

what if you are the star?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not.

-But what if you are?

</line>


<line>
If you don't try, you'll never know.

You'll spend the rest of your life

wondering if you could have made it

or not.

</line>


<line>
Is that what you want?

Always the <name type="ORG">Bratt</name>'s mom and never Da Brat?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-Just... so I don't have to wonder, right?

-Exactly.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go get ready.

This is dumb, but thank you, BoJack.

Like that I've never seen<ital> The Wire,</ital>

and I don't think I'm gonna.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'd never tell a date

that I get the <ital><name type="GPE">New York</name> <name type="ORG">Time</name>s,</ital>

Ah! Mrs. <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>!

</line>


<line>
I was trying to <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

how someone could be like you,

so I did a little research.

</line>


<line>
Did you know a computer can do more

than just find porn?

</line>


<line>
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

</line>


<line>
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

</line>


<line>
I've grown tired of the whole world

thinking of me as a sex object.

</line>


<line>
For once in my life I would like to have

a close, intimate experience

that has nothing to do with sex.

</line>


<line>
-[shouts]

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Asexualize me

like one of your <name type="NORP">French</name> girls, Todd.

</line>


<line>

I can't believe he didn't show up.

Only makes me want him more.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.

</line>


<line>
You can tell

because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

</line>


<line>
Mindy, come down here.

I have a question only you can answer.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
If you really want to be asexual,

first, you have to put on

every piece of clothing you own.

</line>


<line>
That's how we make sure

we don't look sexy.

</line>


<line>
So, leave me and go do that.

</line>


<line>
Very well, but I'll be back

to not have sex with you.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I'm getting less excited

just thinking about it.

</line>


<line>
Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-I need some advice, Mindy.

-That's me. I'm definitely Mindy.

</line>


<line>
So you keep saying.

</line>


<line>
Look, I'd like to give

your sister Yolanda this. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
The last barrel

of your great grandmother's <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret recipe

personal lubricant.

</line>


<line>
As you know, when a <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>

is about to make love

for the first time in our home,

we always give them a barrel

of the family lube.

</line>


<line>
Uh, well...

</line>


<line>
Antique lube of this purity

is worth at least $100,000.

</line>


<line>
Ah-ooga!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello, baby, it's me,

your girlfriend Yolanda.

</line>


<line>
I came to ravage you.

</line>


<line>
There's something different about you,

but I can't put my finger on it.

</line>


<line>
Todd, take off your pants

and get in bed.

</line>


<line>
Wait. What?

</line>


<line>
My dad is about to give us

very expensive lube

just for having sex in this house.

</line>


<line>
And which sister are you?

</line>


<line>
What the hell are you doing in here?

</line>


<line>
Todd, tell Mindy to get her ass

out of here, so we can get nasty.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm </ital>Yolanda.

Get away from my boyfriend!

</line>


<line>
Don't listen to her, Todd.

</line>


<line>
I'm clearly Yolanda

because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.

</line>


<line>
I'm so confused. I'm Todd, right?

</line>


<line>
Maybe, this'll clear things up.

Mindy's the one who's about to die!

</line>


<line>
-[groaning, moaning]

-Oh, dear, I'm too late.

</line>


<line>
They're already having sex.

[sighs] They don't need the lube.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Yolanda]</nonVerbComm> Ouch! That hurts!

</line>


<line>
-Or maybe they do need the lube.

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
Ha! Can't see me now, world.

</line>


<line>
Angelica, as I jizz and breathe,

what the hell are you wearing?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no! The lube!

-Oh, dear!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh!

That's too slippery!

</line>


<line>
-Ho, oh, oh, oh! [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

-[Todd] Oh, my God!

</line>


<line>
-[Mrs. <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>] Ah! Oh!

-[Yolanda] Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mindy]</nonVerbComm> Oh, no! Our grandma's

sexily spinning in her grave.

</line>


<line>
Todd, you gotta save the lube!

Just plug the hole with your erect penis!

</line>


<line>
What? No.

</line>


<line>
It's the only thing

that'll fit the hole perfectly.

</line>


<line>
There has to be another way.

</line>


<line>
Surely it's erect since you've been

just having sex with my daughter,

so <name type="ORG">un</name>less you've been deceiving me,

this whole time, in my own home,

there's no logical reason, for you,

not to whip out your erect penis

and plug the damn hole!

</line>


<line>
Todd, the lube!

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna try my big toe.

That's the penis of the foot.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Yolanda]</nonVerbComm> Oh, God, be careful!

BoJack, I don't know what kind

of power games you two are playing,

but keep it in the bedroom.

That was just mean, to her and to us.

<line>
No. I thought she'd be good.

I was trying to do a nice thing.

And I would like to be judged solely

on my intentions this time.

-That's for trying to trick Todd

into having sex with you!

</line>


<line>
And that's for having sex

with my boyfriend in high school!

</line>


<line>
I never had sex with him!

</line>


<line>
Yes, you did!

The whole school knew about it.

</line>


<line>
No, I didn't.

</line>


<line>
I was going to, but I ran away

because I'm [shouting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know,

it felt good to finally tell them.

</line>


<line>
I was surprised

how cool they were with it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I kind of forgot

that despite our differences,

they're family and they love me.

</line>


<line>
So, I guess all that sneaking aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

was completely pointless.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you're right!

What a silly waste of time.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, can I ask you something?

-Of course.

</line>


<line>
Why did you tell your family

I went to college?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know, I guess

I just wanted you to seem impressive.

</line>


<line>
-Impressive to who?

-Todd... [sighs] To whom.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Yolanda, we need to break up.

-What?

</line>


<line>
The only thing we have in common

is that we're asexual.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,

whom's smart and accomplished

</line>


<line>
-and whom went to college--

-And also doesn't want to have sex?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Probably.

</line>


<line>
-But what if there isn't?

-Well, then let's make a deal.

</line>


<line>
How about if neither of us meet

anybody else by the time we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred,

we give this another shot?

</line>


<line>
When we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred? I don't know.

Are you gonna steal my dentures

and use them to build

some sort of motorized nutcracker,

but then the nutcracker's AI

becomes self-aware

and leads all the other dentures

in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

</line>


<line>
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, then, I guess I'll see you

when we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred.

in <ital>The H<name type="ORG">un</name>t for Red October?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Because you're cold.

</line>


<line>
That one doesn't even make sense.

How do you h<name type="ORG">un</name>t a month?

</line>


<line>
I know that it was really hard

to hear what I said in the restaurant,

but... I want you to know

everything about me,

even the hard stuff.

</line>


<line>
I get it. This is a bad time for you

to start a relationship.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Of course it's a bad time!

</line>


<line>
I just signed divorce papers.

</line>


<line>
But I can't control

when I meet someone special.

</line>


<line>
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend

I don't want to see you every night?

</line>


<line>
But what if I'm like the space station?

</line>


<line>
After a while, you get bored of me

and replace me with someone new.

</line>


<line>
Look, I don't know the future.

</line>


<line>
This could end in heartbreak

for both of us.

</line>


<line>
I mean, most relationships do.

</line>


<line>
And if I'm honest,

it's not usually me that gets bored.

</line>


<line>
But I'd like to see where it goes

because... I like you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> And we have f<name type="ORG">un</name> together.

</line>


<line>
And every time we see each other,

I like you a little more.

</line>


<line>
Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge

against Katy Perry, right now?

</line>


<line>
Because even though it makes no sense,

I want to be held for a superlong time.

<line>

I would have spent the rest of my life

if I ever could have made it or not.

It doesn't mean that everything--
