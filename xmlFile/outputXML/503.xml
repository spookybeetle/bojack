<nonVerbComm>[jazz music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I think, the most important thing here

is that we're honest with each other

and ourselves. Do you agree?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yes?

</line>


<line>
It says, here, you failed

your last six health inspections.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh.

-How are you still in business?

</line>


<line>
I wanna say moxie?

But possibly spunk.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I can't believe

I fell asleep at your house.

</line>


<line>
-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.

-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit

of spending the night or day.

</line>


<line>
I get it. We work together,

we make sex together,

we don't talk about feelings,

and yet sometimes

a begrudging respect can blossom into--

</line>


<line>
-Nope.

-"Blossoms into nothing"

is what I was gonna say.

</line>


<line>
You cut me off, so you look stupid.

</line>


<line>
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.

Look, I took some dumb pictures.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] All right.

-Stupid. Real stupid.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] You can delete some.

-You have a weird eye.

</line>


<line>
-Obsessed much?

-This is what it would look like

if corpses could drool. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
-Hi, excuse me, can I get <ital>The <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?</ital>

-What is that?

</line>


<line>
It's an off-the-menu item

for those in the know.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, I'm <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

and I always order the <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> sandwich.

</line>


<line>
That's kooky.

</line>


<line>
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

</line>


<line>
Because I own this restaurant

and I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
So, are all sandwiches named

after celebrities?

</line>


<line>
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

</line>


<line>
No, that's just a thing

they put in the sandwich.

</line>


<line>
That's not someone's name.

</line>


<line>
Can't it be both? My name is <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I'll have a burger.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'm going to the can.

Have fun with the waitress.

</line>


<line>
-[water running]

-[humming rhythmically]

</line>


<line>
-Um.

-It's me, <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, from before.

</line>


<line>
-It's cool dating a celebrity.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm also dating a celebrity.

Should we start a club?

</line>


<line>
-I call vice president.

-I'm not dating anyone.

</line>


<line>
And if I had to guess,

I'd say neither are you.

</line>


<line>
Guys in this town, especially celebrities,

are not exactly the settle-down type.

</line>


<line>
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.

He doesn't have a problem committing.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

he just got out of his third marriage.

</line>


<line>
A celebrity who just got divorced.

Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

</line>


<line>
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and I

are moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
I don't know you or your relationship,

but I have been around the block

a few times.

</line>


<line>
I was even on an ABC procedural,

called <ital>The Block,</ital> which aired a few times.

</line>


<line>
The key is to have zero expectations,

and then you'll never be disappointed.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, zero expectations,

which also seems to be the mantra

of this restaurant.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
She looks dead.

</line>


<line>
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.

</line>


<line>
Poor girl had dreams.

</line>


<line>
And there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</line>


<line>
Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette,

then kneels down to inspect the corpse.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] Cut!

-[buzzer buzzes]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

you said the stage directions again.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.

It's these night shoots.

</line>


<line>
I think it works.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">John</name> Philbert doesn't play by the rules.

He says his stage directions out loud.

</line>


<line>
It's confusing, which means

the show is daring and smart.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?

-Mm-mm.

</line>


<line>
How could whatever you're listening to

be more fun

</line>


<line>
than hearing me rant

about the fruit spread?

</line>


<line>
Is your rant honeydew related?

</line>


<line>
It's in the honeydew area,

but the specifics are

what keep it fresh each time.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
-[joyful music]

-[grunting]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Are you ready to go?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.

</line>


<line>
If only there was an easy way

</line>


<line>
to keep track

of what time it is right now.

</line>


<line>
-I'll go change.

-No, keep your suit on.

</line>


<line>
My parents are gonna be impressed

I'm dating an executive.

</line>


<line>
Cool!

I've never impressed parents before.

</line>


<line>
I believe that.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I haven't told my family

I'm asexual,

so it might be best if, for tonight,

we just pretend we're sexually active.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's a family dinner.

</line>


<line>
What are the odds they're going to ask

questions about our sexuality, right?

</line>


<line>
Right...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mystery music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
Yeah...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>] Hmm.

-Aha! Whoa. Slow down.

</line>


<line>
-Stop. We're here.

-Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Am I <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> Carell taking a dramatic role

in <ital>Little <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="PERSON">Sunshine</name>,</ital>

and you are the American public

that only knows him for his comedic work?

</line>


<line>
Because... surprise!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Are you the umlaut

in <name type="PERSON">Chloë Sevigny</name>'s name, right now?

</line>


<line>
Because I don't know why you're here,

but I'm glad you are.

</line>


<line>
As Courteney Cox said when she discovered

a rotting corpse in the woods

</line>


<line>
near the <ital>Cougar Town </ital>set,

"Good <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I hope you're not busy."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-This is a thinker.

</line>


<line>
-You'll get it later.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I have a very fun plan for tonight.

</line>


<line>
I just heard that they're going to blow up

the International Space Station.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Blow it up? Why?

-No one knows why space people do things.

</line>


<line>
But I thought we could road trip

out to the desert

and witness the explosion

in all her glory.

</line>


<line>
That sounds amazing!

</line>


<line>
I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,

and not mad at me

for trying to surprise you

with something nice.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
A wise lady, in the bathroom,

told me some stuff.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, she sounds smart. Better listen.

-I think her name was Hamburger.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we should wait, some days,

before going on another date.

</line>


<line>
Okay. If that's how you feel,

you stay here and do nothing,

and I'll go have this amazing,

once-in-a-lifetime experience

all by myself.

</line>


<line>
It does sound cool.

I could also drive to the desert.

</line>


<line>
If we're both going,

we might as well carpool.

</line>


<line>
That's smart! But just to be clear,

we're slowing things down.

</line>


<line>
It's not a date.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Exactly.

</line>


<line>
Is this that mysterious,

brown hors d'oeuvre

</line>


<line>
I ate at <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> McGrath's pool party,

last week?

</line>


<line>
Because... oh, boy. Not a date.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
...and finally, <name type="ORG">Carnegie</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thus, concludes the two-item list

of acceptable melons.

</line>


<line>
-[humming rhythmically]

-Always with the earbuds.

</line>


<line>
What are you listening to?

</line>


<line>
-Hey! No... Ugh!

-[musical playing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> What is this?

</line>


<line>
-This is so corny.

-It's not corny.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

it's technically a musical about corn,

but it's actually sophisticated.

</line>


<line>
Wait a second.

Are you... into musicals?

</line>


<line>
I sense you'll make this a thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic,

who thinks feelings are for suckers,

has a secret soft spot for sappy musicals.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-When you say, "Okay,"

do you mean okay like "correct,"

or okay like "OK-lahoma"?

</line>


<line>
-<ital><music>♪ <name type="GPE">Oklahoma</name> ♪</music></ital>

-All right.

</line>


<line>
Step-ball-change, step-ball-change,

shuffle off to <name type="GPE">Buffalo</name>, and big finish.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, watch out!

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>] Ah... oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-Ouch! <name type="PERSON">God</name> damn it!

</line>


<line>
Once again, my life has been worsened

by a brush with musical theater.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<ital>♪ Oh, yes, it's true</ital>

<ital>I'm feeling so romantic ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Driver</name>, can you put on

something less romantic?

</line>


<line>
I have a podcast

about the space station explosion.

</line>


<line>
Oh, good idea!

Nothing is less romantic than learning.

This is probably weird for you.

No, it would only be weird

if we were on a date, but we're not, so...

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I'm here with Laika,</ital>

</line>


<line>
You got it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[DJ]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Coming up, we got a brand-new single</ital>

<ital>from Twenty-One Pilots.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ew, back to the podcast.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> is the president of ad sales.

-Mm, look at you.

</line>


<line>
-And he went to a really good college.

-I did?

</line>


<line>
That's very impressive.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid we don't know a lot

about the world of big business.

</line>


<line>
As I'm sure <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name> has told you,

</line>


<line>
I'm but a humble,

best-selling, erotic novelist

and my wife is a world-famous,

adult, film star,

and <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>'s identical twin sister,

<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>, is a sex advice columnist.

</line>


<line>
Wow! <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name> told me all of that.

</line>


<line>
That's all really great information,

that I was already privy to.

</line>


<line>
Well, the important thing is

that <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name> is happy

and she's finally found a man, woman,

or object to have sex with.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> is very accomplished

at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.

<name type="PERSON">Hooba</name>, hooba.

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
You know, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, I have a bit

of a reputation, myself. [moans]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Okay, we should be hitting the road.

</line>


<line>
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.

</line>


<line>
You know, I saw the erotic dessert

in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Who knew you could make

such a realistic anus out of marzipan?

</line>


<line>
You can thank my husband.

He posed for the baker.

</line>


<line>
Wow, you know,

it really puts the "um" in "yum."

</line>


<line>
I insist you spend the night

and make love in my home.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-I can't think of a reason,

you wouldn't want to have sex

in your parents' house.

</line>


<line>
Unless, you don't enjoy sex.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sudden sounds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No! Of course we'll spend the night,

and... fornicate.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene

where you make your big confession.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah?

-I was thinking you could maybe confess...

<ital><music>♪ ...in song! ♪</music></ital>

-[grunts]

-Whoa, hey!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, shut up and get in here.

-Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna tell you

something very personal.

</line>


<line>
When I was a little girl, my mom took me

to see <ital>A Kernel of Truth</ital> on Broadway.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a big hit.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know. I Googled the reviews

so I could mock you.

</line>


<line>
That <name type="PERSON">Frank Rich</name> could be

a real frank bitch, am I right?

</line>


<line>
Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

</line>


<line>
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,

getting to sing on Broadway.

</line>


<line>
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

</line>


<line>
So now I get steady TV work,

which is fine, and I'm fine,

but I still listen to that musical

because it reminds me of a time

when I was less jaded,

when I believed I could do anything,

and that makes me feel good.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
I-I didn't realize how much

this musical meant to you.

</line>


<line>
-And that... that's even funnier!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Oh, come on!

</line>


<line>
You know if this were reversed,

you'd be giving me shit.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I'm sorry. I was just teasing.

I was... It was... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, come out of the bathroom.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>? Oh, right.

<nonVerbComm>[Laika]</nonVerbComm> <ital>So, he make for you</ital>

<ital>room, that you always have dream of,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and this is why you leave?</ital>

<ital>Seems like overreaction.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Oh, thank you!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Okay, we're gonna take a break.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm getting kinda hungry.

</line>


<line>
We could stop at a restaurant,

but that's kind of a date thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, fast food doesn't count, right?

</line>


<line>
-Look, there's a KFC at the next exit.

-Perfect.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[piano music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Welcome to KFC,

which stands for <name type="PERSON">Kiki</name>'s <name type="NORP">French</name> Cuisine.

-Hon hon hon!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas

your dad gave me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.

</line>


<line>
Is it just me

or was your sister flirting with me?

</line>


<line>
Ugh, when we were in high school,

</line>


<line>
I was still trying to figure out

my sexuality,

so, I dressed as <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>,

and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

but <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> found out,

and now that I have a boyfriend,

she probably wants to have sex with you

to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

</line>


<line>
I thought sisters were doing it

for themselves.

</line>


<line>
I mean, what does she need me for?

</line>


<line>
-[knocking]

-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>,

can you help me move some furniture?

My husband has a hernia.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.

</line>


<line>
So, what, uh,

furniture do you want me to--

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-Oh, no! Your garment fell.

</line>


<line>
This must be so embarrassing for you.

</line>


<line>
Just as I suspected.

You're not sexual at all.

</line>


<line>
Like, heck I'm not.

</line>


<line>
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused

by the body that starred in every single

porn version of a <name type="PERSON">John</name> Hughes movie:

When the cock crows midnight,

meet me under the old willow tree

in the backyard for sex.

</line>


<line>
-Zoinks!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, quick update.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> wants to meet me

for backyard sex at midnight,

and your mother knows I'm asexual.

</line>


<line>
She showed me her boobs.

</line>


<line>
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"

</line>


<line>
Oh, I didn't!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! She'll disown me!

We gotta convince her you're super horny.

</line>


<line>
-How?

-If <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> told my mom

that you made a pass at her,

that would prove you're not asexual.

</line>


<line>
Here's the plan.

We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.

</line>


<line>
Who is this cock?

</line>


<line>
When she's at the backyard,

</line>


<line>
I'll sneak in her room

and wear her clothes.

</line>


<line>
I'll pretend I'm <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>

and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, this sounds a little complicated,

but I think I can handle

exactly this amount of complication

as long as things don't become

one bit more complicated.

</line>


<line>
-[musical playing over earbuds]

-Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> It's okay.

Just don't tell anyone about it.

</line>


<line>
Good news; too late.

I talked to <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> and Princess Carolyn

about how you're

into this Broadway crap...

</line>


<line>
-What?

-...and they said maybe you can sing

in the nightclub episode.

Can you believe it?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-It's your big break, and I helped!

</line>


<line>
I don't want help.

Why would you do that?

</line>


<line>
I know you don't want me

doing nice things

because I'm not your boyfriend,

and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

but they want to hear you sing

at the next break.

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, this is your dream,

and there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't work that way.

</line>


<line>
You're used to being the star,

so good things always happen to you.

</line>


<line>
I'm not the star.

</line>


<line>
I'm the third on the call sheet

for <ital>Murder Hospital,</ital>

or <ital>Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,

</line>


<line>
I can get a<ital> </ital>juicy season arc

on the right cable show

where everyone goes,

"Who's this 60-year-old woman?

</line>


<line>
She came out of nowhere."

Then I win an Emmy in a movie

where I play <name type="PERSON">Benjamin <name type="ORG">Bratt</name></name>'s mother.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I know, but what I'm saying is,

what if you are the star?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not.

-But what if you are?

</line>


<line>
If you don't try, you'll never know.

You'll spend the rest of your life

wondering if you could have made it

or not.

</line>


<line>
Is that what you want?

Always the <name type="ORG">Bratt</name>'s mom and never Da Brat?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-Just... so I don't have to wonder, right?

-Exactly.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go get ready.

This is dumb, but thank you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

I feel like, I can say all the things

I would never say on a date.

</line>


<line>
Like that I've never seen<ital> The Wire,</ital>

and I don't think I'm gonna.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'd never tell a date

that I get the <ital><name type="GPE">New York</name> Times,</ital>

but I only read the style section

and throw the rest away.

</line>


<line>
I don't have or want children,

but I silently judge every parent

that I see in public.

</line>


<line>
I sleep with a chew toy,

since I was a kid.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

I still have feelings for Diannnne.

</line>


<line>
Oh. That's much less fun

than the other things.

Uh, listen--

<line>
Ah! Mrs. <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>!

</line>


<line>
I was trying to understand

how someone could be like you,

so I did a little research.

</line>


<line>
Did you know a computer can do more

than just find porn?

</line>


<line>
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

</line>


<line>
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

</line>


<line>
I've grown tired of the whole world

thinking of me as a sex object.

</line>


<line>
For once in my life I would like to have

a close, intimate experience

that has nothing to do with sex.

</line>


<line>
-[shouts]

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Asexualize me

like one of your <name type="NORP">French</name> girls, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
Gulp!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic sounds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I can't believe he didn't show up.

Only makes me want him more.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Mom, are you there? It's me, <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>.

</line>


<line>
You can tell

because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>, come down here.

I have a question only you can answer.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
If you really want to be asexual,

first, you have to put on

every piece of clothing you own.

</line>


<line>
That's how we make sure

we don't look sexy.

</line>


<line>
So, leave me and go do that.

</line>


<line>
Very well, but I'll be back

to not have sex with you.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I'm getting less excited

just thinking about it.

</line>


<line>
Hoo-hoo! <name type="PERSON">Hooba</name>, hooba.

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-I need some advice, <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>.

-That's me. I'm definitely <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>.

</line>


<line>
So you keep saying.

</line>


<line>
Look, I'd like to give

your sister <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name> this. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
The last barrel

of your great grandmother's secret recipe

personal lubricant.

</line>


<line>
As you know, when a <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>

is about to make love

for the first time in our home,

we always give them a barrel

of the family lube.

</line>


<line>
Uh, well...

</line>


<line>
Antique lube of this purity

is worth at least $100,000.

</line>


<line>
Ah-ooga!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rhythmic sounds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hello, baby, it's me,

your girlfriend <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>.

</line>


<line>
I came to ravage you.

</line>


<line>
There's something different about you,

but I can't put my finger on it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, take off your pants

and get in bed.

</line>


<line>
Wait. What?

</line>


<line>
My dad is about to give us

very expensive lube

just for having sex in this house.

</line>


<line>
And which sister are you?

</line>


<line>
What the hell are you doing in here?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, tell <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> to get her ass

out of here, so we can get nasty.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm </ital><name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>.

Get away from my boyfriend!

</line>


<line>
Don't listen to her, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm clearly <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>

because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.

</line>


<line>
I'm so confused. I'm <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
Maybe, this'll clear things up.

<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>'s the one who's about to die!

</line>


<line>
-[groaning, moaning]

-Oh, dear, I'm too late.

</line>


<line>
They're already having sex.

[sighs] They don't need the lube.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>]</nonVerbComm> Ouch! That hurts!

</line>


<line>
-Or maybe they do need the lube.

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
Ha! Can't see me now, world.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Angelica</name>, as I jizz and breathe,

what the hell are you wearing?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no! The lube!

-Oh, dear!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. <name type="GPE">Buenaventura</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh!

That's too slippery!

</line>


<line>
-Ho, oh, oh, oh! [grunts]

</line>


<line>

-[<name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>] Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, no! Our grandma's

sexily spinning in her grave.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, you gotta save the lube!

Just plug the hole with your erect penis!

</line>


<line>
What? No.

</line>


<line>
It's the only thing

that'll fit the hole perfectly.

</line>


<line>
There has to be another way.

</line>


<line>
Surely it's erect since you've been

just having sex with my daughter,

so unless you've been deceiving me,

this whole time, in my own home,

there's no logical reason, for you,

not to whip out your erect penis

and plug the damn hole!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, the lube!

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna try my big toe.

That's the penis of the foot.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, be careful!

Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

That was weird.

You know what, she was nervous, and--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I don't know what kind

of power games you two are playing,

but keep it in the bedroom.

</line>


<line>
That was just mean, to her and to us.

</line>


<line>
No. I thought she'd be good.

I was trying to do a nice thing.

</line>

And I would like to be judged solely

on my intentions this time.

-[both grunting]

-That's for trying to trick <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>

into having sex with you!

</line>


<line>
And that's for having sex

with my boyfriend in high school!

</line>


<line>
I never had sex with him!

</line>


<line>
Yes, you did!

The whole school knew about it.

</line>


<line>
No, I didn't.

</line>


<line>
I was going to, but I ran away

because I'm [shouting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know,

it felt good to finally tell them.

</line>


<line>
I was surprised

how cool they were with it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I kind of forgot

that despite our differences,

they're family and they love me.

</line>


<line>
So, I guess all that sneaking around

was completely pointless.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you're right!

What a silly waste of time.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, can I ask you something?

-Of course.

</line>


<line>
Why did you tell your family

I went to college?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know, I guess

I just wanted you to seem impressive.

</line>


<line>
-Impressive to who?

-<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>... [sighs] To whom.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>, we need to break up.

-What?

</line>


<line>
The only thing we have in common

is that we're asexual.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,

whom's smart and accomplished

</line>


<line>
-and whom went to college--

-And also doesn't want to have sex?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Probably.

</line>


<line>
-But what if there isn't?

-Well, then let's make a deal.

</line>


<line>
How about if neither of us meet

anybody else by the time we're a hundred,

we give this another shot?

</line>


<line>
When we're a hundred? I don't know.

Are you gonna steal my dentures

and use them to build

some sort of motorized nutcracker,

but then the nutcracker's AI

becomes self-aware

and leads all the other dentures

in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

</line>


<line>
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, then, I guess I'll see you

when we're a hundred.

Are you the type of war dramatized

in <ital>The Hunt for Red October?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Because you're cold.

</line>


<line>
That one doesn't even make sense.

How do you hunt a month?

</line>


<line>
I know that it was really hard

to hear what I said in the restaurant,

but... I want you to know

everything about me,

even the hard stuff.

</line>


<line>
I get it. This is a bad time for you

to start a relationship.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Of course it's a bad time!

</line>


<line>
I just signed divorce papers.

</line>


<line>
But I can't control

when I meet someone special.

</line>


<line>
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend

I don't want to see you every night?

</line>


<line>
But what if I'm like the space station?

</line>


<line>
After a while, you get bored of me

and replace me with someone new.

</line>


<line>
Look, I don't know the future.

</line>


<line>
This could end in heartbreak

for both of us.

</line>


<line>
I mean, most relationships do.

</line>


<line>
And if I'm honest,

it's not usually me that gets bored.

</line>


<line>
But I'd like to see where it goes

because... I like you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> And we have fun together.

</line>


<line>
And every time we see each other,

I like you a little more.

</line>


<line>
Hmm. Hey, am I <name type="PERSON">Taylor</name> Swift's grudge

against <name type="PERSON">Katy Perry</name>, right now?

</line>


<line>

I want to be held for a superlong time.

-and not get in each other's business.

-Yes, of course.

</line>


<line>
-[stammers] I'm sorry. I didn't even--

-For the record, you were right.

</line>


<line>
If I didn't sing there,

I would have spent the rest of my life

not knowing

if I ever could have made it or not.

</line>


<line>
Now I know. So, good.

</line>


<line>
You had a bad audition.

It doesn't mean that everything--

</line>


<line>
I said it's fine.

</line>


<line>
You did your good deed,

so, you can feel good about yourself.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-I'm going to bed.

</line>

Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.
