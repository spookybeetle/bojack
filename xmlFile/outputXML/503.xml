</line>


<line>
I think, the most important thing here

is that we're <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest with each other

and ourselves. Do you agree?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yes?

</line>


<line>
It says, here, you failed

your last six health inspections.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh.

-How are you still in business?

</line>


<line>
I wanna say moxie?

But possibly sp<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I can't believe

I fell asleep at your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ots are messing up my rhythm.

-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> make a habit

of spending the night or day.

</line>


<line>
I get it. We work together,

we make sex together,

we don't talk about feelings,

and yet sometimes

a begrudging respect can blossom into--

</line>


<line>
-Nope.

-"Blossoms into nothing"

is what I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> say.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u cut me off, so you look stupid.

</line>


<line>
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I took some dumb pictures.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>] All right.

-Stupid. Real stupid.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>] <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can delete some.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have a weird eye.

</line>


<line>
-Obsessed much?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is what it would look like

if corpses could drool. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>, excuse me, can I get <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?</ital>

-What is that?

</line>


<line>
It's an off-the-menu item

for t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se in the know.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, I'm <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>

and I always order the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> sandwich.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's kooky.

</line>


<line>
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

</line>


<line>
Because I own this restaurant

and I'm a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
So, are all sandwiches named

after celebrities?

</line>


<line>
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

</line>


<line>
No, that's just a thing

they put in the sandwich.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not someone's name.

</line>


<line>
Can't it be both? My name is <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I'll have a burger.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I'm going to the can.

Have f<name type="ORG">un</name> with the waitress.

</line>


<line>
-[water r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning]

-[hu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing rhythmically]

</line>


<line>
-Um.

-It's me, <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, from before.

</line>


<line>
-It's cool dating a celebrity.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I'm also dating a celebrity.

S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we start a club?

</line>


<line>
-I call vice president.

-I'm not dating anyone.

</line>


<line>
And if I had to guess,

I'd say neither are you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s in this town, especially celebrities,

are not exactly the settle-down type.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why I hit the <name type="PERSON">jack</name>pot with my guy.

He doesn't have a problem co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>itting.

</line>


<line>
In fact,

he just got out of his third marriage.

</line>


<line>
A celebrity w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> just got divorced.

Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

</line>


<line>
Do you think Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter and I

are moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
I don't know you or your relationship,

but I have been aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the block

a few times.

</line>


<line>
I was even on an <name type="ORG">ABC</name> procedural,

called <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Block,</ital> which aired a few times.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he key is to have zero expectations,

and then you'll never be disappointed.

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, zero expectations,

which also seems to be the mantra

of this restaurant.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
She looks dead.

</line>


<line>
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.

</line>


<line>
Poor girl had dreams.

</line>


<line>
And there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> takes a drag of his ci<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rette,

then kneels down to inspect the corpse.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] Cut!

-[buzzer buzzes]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

you said the stage directions a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.

It's these night s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ots.

</line>


<line>
I think it works.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">John</name> <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> doesn't play by the rules.

He says his stage directions out loud.

</line>


<line>
It's confusing, which means

the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w is daring and smart.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?

-Mm-<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
How could whatever you're listening to

be more f<name type="ORG">un</name>

</line>


<line>
than hearing me rant

about the fruit spread?

</line>


<line>
Is your rant <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew related?

</line>


<line>
It's in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>neydew area,

but the specifics are

what keep it fresh each time.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I didn't realize <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w late it got.

</line>


<line>
If only there was an easy way

</line>


<line>
to keep track

of what time it is right now.

</line>


<line>
-I'll go change.

-No, keep your suit on.

</line>


<line>
My parents are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be impressed

I'm dating an executive.

</line>


<line>
Cool!

I've never impressed parents before.

</line>


<line>
I believe that.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I haven't told my family

I'm asexual,

so it might be best if, for tonight,

we just pretend we're sexually active.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's a family dinner.

</line>


<line>
What are the odds they're going to ask

questions about our sexuality, right?

</line>


<line>
Right...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[mystery music]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
Yeah...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>] H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

-Aha! W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a. Slow down.

</line>


<line>
-Stop. We're here.

-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter?

</line>


<line>
Am I <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> Carell taking a dramatic role

in <ital>Little <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="PERSON">S<name type="ORG">un</name>shine</name>,</ital>

and you are the <name type="GPE">America</name>n public

</line>


<line>
Because... surprise!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Are you the umlaut

in <name type="PERSON">Chloë Sevigny's</name> name, right now?

</line>


<line>
Because I don't know why you're here,

but I'm glad you are.

</line>


<line>
As <name type="ORG">Court</name>eney Cox said when she discovered

a rotting corpse in the woods

</line>


<line>
near the <ital>Cou<name type="PERSON">ga</name>r <name type="PERSON">T</name>own </ital>set,

"<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe you're not busy."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a thinker.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u'll get it later.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
I have a very f<name type="ORG">un</name> plan for tonight.

</line>


<line>
I just heard that they're going to blow up

the <name type="FAC">International Space Station</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Blow it up? Why?

-No one knows why space people do things.

</line>


<line>
But I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught we could road trip

out to the desert

and witness the explosion

in all her glory.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds amazing!

</line>


<line>
I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,

and not mad at me

for trying to surprise you

with something nice.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?

</line>


<line>
A wise lady, in the bathroom,

told me some stuff.

</line>


<line>
-Ooh, she so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds smart. Better listen.

-I think her name was Hamburger.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld wait, some days,

before going on another date.

</line>


<line>
Okay. If that's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you feel,

you stay here and do nothing,

and I'll go have this amazing,

once-in-a-lifetime experience

all by myself.

</line>


<line>
It does so<name type="ORG">un</name>d cool.

I could also drive to the desert.

</line>


<line>
If we're both going,

we might as well carpool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's smart! But just to be clear,

we're slowing things down.

</line>


<line>
It's not a date.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Exactly.

</line>


<line>
Is this that mysterious,

brown <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rs d'oeuvre

</line>


<line>
I ate at <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rk <name type="PERSON">McG</name>rath's pool party,

last week?

</line>


<line>
Because... oh, boy. Not a date.

-It's not corny.

it's technically a musical about corn,

but it's actually sophisticated.

</line>


<line>

Are you... into musicals?

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

has a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret soft spot for sappy musicals.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

I'm but a humble,

When I was a little girl, my mom took me

to see <ital>A Kernel of <name type="PERSON">T</name>ruth</ital> on <name type="FAC">Broadway</name>.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a big hit.

</line>

so I could mock you.

Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

I spent my child<name type="PERSON">ho</name>od dreaming of, one day,

getting to sing on <name type="FAC">Broadway</name>.

</line>


<line>
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

</line>


<line>
So now I get steady <name type="PERSON">T</name>V work,

which is fine, and I'm fine,

but I still listen to that musical

because it reminds me of a time

Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> wants to meet me

She s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed me her boobs.

Oh, no! She'll disown me!

We gotta convince her you're super <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rny.

</line>


<line>
-How?

-If <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name> told my mom

that you made a pass at her,

that would prove you're not asexual.

We'll wait <name type="ORG">un</name>til the cock crows midnight.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this cock?

<line>
I'll sneak in her room

I'll pretend I'm <name type="PERSON">Mindy</name>

and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, this so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds a little complicated,

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-It's your big break, and I helped!

</line>

I don't want help.

Why would you do that?

doing nice things

into having sex with you!

</line>


<line>
And that's for having sex

with my boyfriend in high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol!

</line>


<line>
I never had sex with him!

</line>


<line>
Yes, you did!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol knew about it.

</line>


<line>
No, I didn't.

</line>


<line>
I was going to, but I ran away

because I'm [s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

it felt good to finally tell them.

</line>


<line>
I was surprised

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w cool they were with it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I kind of forgot

that despite our differences,

they're family and they love me.

</line>


<line>
So, I guess all that sneaking aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

was completely pointless.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you're right!

What a silly waste of time.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, can I ask you something?

-Of course.

</line>


<line>
Why did you tell your family

I went to college?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know, I guess

I just wanted you to seem impressive.

</line>


<line>
-Impressive to w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>landa, we need to break up.

-What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only thing we have in co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on

is that we're asexual.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m's smart and accomplished

</line>


<line>
-and w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m went to college--

-And also doesn't want to have sex?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Probably.

</line>


<line>
-But what if there isn't?

-Well, then let's make a deal.

</line>


<line>
How about if neither of us meet

anybody else by the time we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred,

we give this another s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t?

</line>


<line>
When we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred? I don't know.

Are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> steal my dentures

and use them to build

some sort of motorized nutcracker,

but then the nutcracker's AI

becomes self-aware

and leads all the other dentures

in the nursing <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me in a toothy revolt?

</line>


<line>
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, then, I guess I'll see you

when we're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred.

Are you the type of war dramatized

</line>


<line>
Because you're cold.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat one doesn't even make sense.

How do you h<name type="ORG">un</name>t a month?

</line>


<line>
I know that it was really hard

to hear what I said in the restaurant,

but... I want you to know

everything about me,

even the hard stuff.

</line>


<line>
I get it. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a bad time for you

to start a relationship.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Of course it's a bad time!

</line>


<line>
I just signed divorce papers.

</line>


<line>
But I can't control

when I meet someone special.

</line>


<line>
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend

I don't want to see you every night?

</line>


<line>
But what if I'm like the space station?

</line>


<line>
After a while, you get bored of me

and replace me with someone new.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I don't know the future.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his could end in heartbreak

for both of us.

</line>


<line>
I mean, most relationships do.

</line>


<line>
And if I'm <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest,

it's not usually me that gets bored.

</line>


<line>
But I'd like to see where it goes

because... I like you.

</line>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> And we have f<name type="ORG">un</name> together.
