</line>


<line>
We're doing it, buddy! First day!

</line>


<line>
Listen, I still have some questions

about my character,

and the script, and the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

and you asking me to do this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

</line>


<line>
-and me saying, "Yes".

-Hey, can we get rid of <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>'s watch?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he network doesn't want us

to remind the audience

about the existence of clocks.

And why we're making a <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man...

-Oh, jeez. Here we go.

</line>


<line>
...and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

on the same studio backlot?

</line>


<line>
-One <name type="ORG">sec</name>--

-What is this?

</line>


<line>
-A mismatched buddy comedy...

-No.

</line>


<line>
...about two guys

from different sides of the tracks

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> learn to respect each other

because they have a co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on interest?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>'s this guy?

-Ignore him. Why--

</line>


<line>
And a grudging respect

blossoms into real friendship

</line>


<line>
as they set aside their differences

to achieve a shared goal...

</line>


<line>
-Stop it.

-...each bringing their own strength

to the table,

and possibly there's a karaoke scene?

</line>


<line>
Why does <name type="PERSON">John</name> <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>'s <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

look the same as my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
I've never been to your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>

<name type="PERSON">Detective <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name></name>.

Spare, lonely, precariously balanced

on a hill of his own isolation.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he set designer

actually took a tour there.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's very interesting.

</line>


<line>
Why are you here?

</line>


<line>
I'm playing <name type="PERSON">Julius Caesar</name>

on the stage next door, in a movie!

</line>


<line>
Well, it's a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt film.

</line>

</line>

Sorry, I can't do you.

</line>


<line>
I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know your own body better than me

anyway so just go to town.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go.

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

Can I ask you a question, about you?

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh?

</line>


<line>
Do you think I'm right, and

the <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> character is poorly written,

and <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> needs to write him better,

so I don't look so bad?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I do one of these s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ws every year.

</line>


<line>
And I keep getting hired

because I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up, do the work,

and keep my head down.

</line>


<line>
But do you love this script?

Do you love your character?

</line>


<line>
Do I love <name type="ORG">Internal Affairs</name> <name type="PERSON">Di</name>rector

<name type="ORG">Sassy</name> <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>lone,

</line>


<line>
w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se primary character traits

are that she hates bras

</line>


<line>
and loves cold rooms?

</line>


<line>
Not especially.

It feels gratuitous and male-<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zey.

</line>


<line>
But it pays for my expensive habit

of having a mort<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ge

</line>


<line>
-in <name type="NORP">Southern</name> <name type="GPE">California</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to go.

</line>


<line>
We could hang out.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure you don't wanna be all alone

in a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use by yourself.

</line>


<line>
No, I love being alone.

I wish I were alone right now.

you don't need to sleep anymore?

<ital>No, I was sleeping.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u called me and woke me up.

</line>

I wanted you to know

that I hearted your <name type="ORG">Instagram</name> p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>to.

</line>


<line>
Okay, cool.

</line>


<line>
Well, there were 23 other hearts.

</line>


<line>
But I don't know if you know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> they're all from, but one was from me.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, they let me know.

</line>


<line>
Oh, cool, cool.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm going back to sleep.

</line>


<line>
Fine, but this p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne call does not replace

our weekly S<name type="ORG">un</name>day call. Okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'll talk to you S<name type="ORG">un</name>day afternoon.

</line>


<line>
Yes. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d. Because I miss you.

Don't mind me, just passing through!

Not sneaking a peek at the lovebugs!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's nothing to see

that would embarrass any of us.

</line>


<line>
-We are all fully clothed.

-Ha-ha. If you say so!

</line>


<line>
What are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do

while I'm at work all day?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's an old frog

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> lives down in <name type="LOC">the L.A. River</name>.

</line>


<line>
He owes me an egg salad sandwich,

on acco<name type="ORG">un</name>t of a caper we once went on.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see if he wants

to make instruments out of s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>eboxes

and rubber bands.

</line>


<line>
And, uh, that will satisfy you?

</line>


<line>
When your life is ends,

and you're looking back at this day,

you'll think that was a good day?

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Well, from your preliminary paperwork

you seem like a perfect candidate.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks, I just never t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

it would be like this.

</line>


<line>
I mean, my mom popped out kids

by the dozen. And I can't even--

</line>


<line>
Mnh-mnh. Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

is your name <name type="PERSON">Cutie Cutie</name> Cupcake?

</line>


<line>
-No, that's--

-Were you born on August 12th, 1947?

</line>


<line>
-I--

-Do you sleep with your hands stuffed

</line>


<line>
-in lotion-filled socks?

-No.

</line>


<line>
Right, because you are not your mother.

</line>


<line>
-How did you know--

-What you are is noble,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>norable, and <name type="ORG">un</name>impeachable.

</line>


<line>
Anyone can just have a baby.

But to adopt one? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat takes a hero.

</line>


<line>
It takes a selfless, giving,

kickass superwoman

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s willing to take out

her checkbook right now

and write the adoption agency

a check for $60,000.

</line>


<line>
Well. [sighs] Okay.

</line>


<line>
Fabulous.

</line>


<line>
I'm just so glad

that I'm on this journey with you.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

I'm with you every step of the way,

from you giving me this check

all the way to me introducing you

to your new caseworker, <name type="PERSON">T</name>racy.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Ah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're in wonderful hands, bye!

</line>


<line>
Uh, what--

</line>


<line>
Congratulations. What are you,

like, five months pregnant?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not a birth mother. I'm adopting.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that makes sense.

'Cause you're so old.

</line>


<line>
Is Mikhaela ever coming back?

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs] Yeah, in your dreams.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What?!

</line>


<line>
Jeanine, the script

calls for <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t and ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted.

</line>


<line>
Does this girl look <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t

and ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted to you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm sure she was <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t

for <ital><name type="PERSON">Shakespeare</name> in the Park,</ital>

but I need <name type="PERSON">T</name>V <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t.

</line>


<line>
-Actually, she's starting to look ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ted.

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Uh, this a bad time?

-It's fine.

</line>


<line>
I can talk to you and also judge

these women's bodies at the same time.

</line>


<line>
What do you want?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, first of all,

the script is great.

</line>


<line>
Really top-notch stuff.

I love the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le... thing of it.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to clarify some things

about <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> as a character.

</line>


<line>
Mm-h<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, on page three,

is it necessary that <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>

can only or<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sm if he's listening

</line>


<line>
-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, what about this thing

on page eight

where he goes to a strip club and just

sits in the back with a sketch-pad

and draws the strippers,

while a <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>nard Cohen song plays?

</line>


<line>
What about it?

</line>


<line>
It's just that

all of these half-naked women.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand it.

</line>


<line>
I'm just worried it might come across

as gratuitous and, uh, male-<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zey,

which I know it isn't!

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u girls can go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he stripper scene's cut.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Seriously?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, oh. Uh...

-How am I <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> feed my baby?

</line>


<line>
I just got an idea for something better.

</line>


<line>
So, instead of drawing strippers naked,

you're just going to draw <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> naked.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> was concerned the old scene

was gratuitous and male-<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zey.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he was? <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> said that?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is much more interesting

and motivated by character.

</line>


<line>
And since it's motivated by character,

that means it's not gratuitous.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for the note, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

you really helped.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, for helping.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, um...

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] Can we get some ice?

</line>


<line>
Can we get some nipple ice for <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>?

</line>


<line>
-So, you're the famous <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>landa.

-I am not famous.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u might have me confused

with another more famous <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>landa.

</line>


<line>
I know, I-I just meant

because <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd talks about you so much,

</line>


<line>
I feel like you're famous.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, that was not clear.

</line>


<line>
Okay. <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, why don't you say things now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Steve</name>, you still fi<name type="GPE">xin</name>g up your truck?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're thinking of <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>'s old boyfriend,

firefighter <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> D'<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rco.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm firefighter <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> D'<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>zio.

We're very different.

</line>


<line>
But I do have a truck,

and I'm fi<name type="GPE">xin</name>g it up.

</line>


<line>
So, thanks for asking.

</line>


<line>
I created a dating app

for firefighters to meet me.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oks like it worked.

-[chuckles] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Hey! We s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld create a dating app

for asexuals.

</line>


<line>
Why would asexuals want a dating app?

</line>


<line>
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hink of it this way.

</line>


<line>
One could be: A, <name type="PERSON">Roman</name>tic,

or B, Aromantic,

while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.

</line>


<line>
So you could be <name type="ORG">BB</name>, or BA.

</line>


<line>
As for me, see AB, see?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
So, even within the one percent

of the population that's asexual,

there's an even smaller percentage

that is still looking

for romantic companionship.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a pretty thin user base

for an app.

</line>


<line>
But wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut it, asexual romantics

might end up settling for just whatever

other asexual romantics they might meet,

even if they have nothing else in co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on.

</line>


<line>
-Well, anyway--

-Yeah, but maybe it's good

if they have nothing in co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on

because then they can help each other grow

and change, and become fuller,

more well-ro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded people.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's true.

</line>


<line>
So, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, are you still doing

that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, that w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing kinda fell apart

when the clowns got loose.

</line>

I'm just trying to make a good s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

that's brilliant and <name type="ORG">un</name>precedented.

</line>


<line>
It so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like you guys

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the only one with a problem here.

</line>

-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> is fine with it.

-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> is not fine with it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u guys, you're almost saying

exactly the same thing.

</line>


<line>
Except one of you is saying "not".

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, do you have a problem

with the nudity in this scene?

</line>


<line>
It's great. It's brilliant, <name type="ORG">un</name>precedented.

I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get some potatoes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u see? Everyone's fine with it but you.

</line>


<line>
So, can we drop it?

</line>


<line>
I know you're used to being

the most important person on set.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not about me.

-It's weird for you

that I don't need to listen.

</line>


<line>
-I'm not--

-Hey, hey--

</line>


<line>
But if you actually have notes

that are helpful,

</line>


<line>
I would love to hear them when

you're done swinging your dick aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
-No, this is not about my dick.

-Okay, fellas...

</line>


<line>
-Well, maybe it s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be about your dick.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Since you're so concerned

about the male <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ze,

let's give the females

something to <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ze at.

</line>


<line>
We'll do a full-frontal nude scene

with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is compromise!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is working together.

</line>


<line>
-Well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld on.

-Fully exposed, <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> reaches up

</line>


<line>
-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
He totters in little circles

on a tiny stool.

</line>


<line>
-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?

-Full body rotation. We see everything.

</line>


<line>
Now we're talking!

</line>


<line>
-No, we're not! Princess--

-I'm on it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> can only do this scene

</line>


<line>
-if he can wear a <name type="PERSON">T</name>-shirt.

-What?

</line>


<line>
He's very self-conscious

about his belly area.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm self-conscious

about my penis area.

</line>


<line>
He can't wear a shirt.

</line>


<line>
It's about being vulnerable.

</line>


<line>
We see every fold and imperfection

of his wrinkled, saggy body.

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-So we like him.

</line>


<line>
But he has to be fully erect

so we respect him.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-We'll s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot it tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Unless you don't like this idea,

in which case, we can go back

to what we were doing.

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-Well--

</line>


<line>
So, you would be admitting

that you don't actually care

about the male <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ze

and you were only giving me notes

to hear yourself talk.

</line>


<line>
But that's not it, right?

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-Great.

</line>


<line>
-S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting is tomorrow afternoon.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-I'll send the wa<name type="GPE">xin</name>g kit over tonight.

-<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> waxes?

</line>


<line>
Not for cosmetic purposes.

He just wants to feel something.

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles]

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
I like your friend.

It's impressive <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w she creates companies.

</line>


<line>
And her boyfriend has

an interesting career as well.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! And you have an interesting career.

</line>


<line>
Hey! <name type="PERSON">T</name>he three of you

all have interesting careers.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is so cool!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, do you ever feel weird

that you have

no discernible life direction?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Let me rephrase that.

</line>


<line>
I feel weird that you have

no discernible life direction.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-I mean...

</line>


<line>
-What am I supposed to tell people?

-A story? A joke?

</line>


<line>
Compliments are things

people like being told sometimes.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. How was your day?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you end up meeting with that frog?

</line>


<line>
No, I just stayed <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

and looked at stuff on the Internet.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]

-Hello, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

Why are you not Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn?

</line>


<line>
-She gets <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me pretty late.

-I came all this way for nothing?

</line>


<line>
I brought my spinny chair

and everything!

</line>


<line>
Well, if you want something to do,

you could help me find a job.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're looking for a job?

-I spent all day looking!

</line>


<line>
First, I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld get a newspaper to find one,

but then I was, like,

"Where do I find a newspaper?"

</line>


<line>
-Uh.

-So, I looked it up.

</line>


<line>
And a map came up of my local area.

</line>


<line>
So, then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I know this area pretty well,

but there's all kinds of areas

I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Like South <name type="LOC">Africa</name>.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-And then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about <name type="PERSON">Char</name>lize <name type="PERSON">T</name>heron.

-Uh, right.

</line>


<line>
And then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about

that movie <ital><name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nster.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And then I was, like,

"What year did that come out?"

</line>


<line>
-So I went to <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nster.com...

-[pc clacking]

</line>


<line>

Interview for that job!

</line>


<line>
Uh... Was that your amazing idea?

</line>


<line>
Because I feel, like,

it kinda came out of the room.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
