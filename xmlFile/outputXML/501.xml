</line>


<line>
Come on, guys. Pay attention.

The squib didn't fire.

</line>


<line>
-What did I do?

-Not you. Squib. Squib.

</line>


<line>
-The squib.

-I don't need any help. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-You're doing great, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
And I did a great job watching you,

which is most of what producing is.

</line>


<line>
We're doing it, buddy! First day!

</line>


<line>
Listen, I still have some questions

about my character,

and the script, and the show,

and you asking me to do this show,

</line>


<line>
-and me saying, "Yes".

-Hey, can we get rid of Philbert's watch?

</line>


<line>
The network doesn't want us

to remind the audience

about the existence of clocks.

</line>


<line>
And why we're making a TV show

for What-<name type="ORG">Time</name>-Is-It-Right-Now-dot-com,

which is a website for people

who don't know their computers

already have built-in clocks

at the corner of the screen?

</line>


<line>
All your questions will be answered.

</line>


<line>
But in the meantime,

would it kill you to smile?

Just like a bitch to shoot me

in the heart, bitch.

</line>


<line>
Good thing I carry this flask

full of my dead wife's blood around.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[director]</nonVerbComm> And, cut.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>. Can I ask why I'm calling

her a bitch twice?

</line>


<line>
The first bitch is her.

The second bitch is your heart.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you know, I have some questions

about my character.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I have two minutes.

-Okay, well, my first question is--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>...

-Oh, jeez. Here we go.

</line>


<line>
...and Mr. Peanutbutter

on the same studio backlot?

</line>


<line>
-One sec--

-What is this?

</line>


<line>
-A mismatched buddy comedy...

-No.

</line>


<line>
...about two guys

from different sides of the tracks

who learn to respect each other

because they have a common interest?

</line>


<line>
-Who's this guy?

-Ignore him. Why--

</line>


<line>
And a grudging respect

blossoms into real friendship

</line>


<line>
as they set aside their differences

to achieve a shared goal...

</line>


<line>
-Stop it.

-...each bringing their own strength

to the table,

and possibly there's a karaoke scene?

</line>


<line>
Why does <name type="PERSON">John</name> Philbert's house

look the same as my house?

</line>


<line>
I've never been to your house.

</line>


<line>
The set was designed to reflect

<name type="PERSON">Detective Philbert</name>.

</line>


<line>
Spare, lonely, precariously balanced

on a hill of his own isolation.

</line>


<line>
It kind of looks

like <name type="PERSON">David</name> <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name>'s house.

</line>


<line>
The set designer

actually took a tour there.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's very interesting.

</line>


<line>
Why are you here?

</line>


<line>
I'm playing <name type="PERSON">Julius Caesar</name>

on the stage next door, in a movie!

</line>


<line>
Well, it's a short film.

</line>


<line>
-I gotta run.

-Wait!

</line>


<line>
I'll see you next time

I'm <ital>Roman</ital> around the lot!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, when can we talk?

-Tomorrow morning.

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Hey.

-Yikes, was that it? You done?

</line>


<line>
-[exhales]

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I can't do you.

</line>


<line>
I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.

</line>


<line>
You know your own body better than me

anyway so just go to town.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

Can I ask you a question, about you?

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh?

</line>


<line>
Do you think I'm right, and

the Philbert character is poorly written,

and <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> needs to write him better,

so I don't look so bad?

</line>


<line>
Look, I do one of these shows every year.

</line>


<line>
And I keep getting hired

because I show up, do the work,

and keep my head down.

</line>


<line>
But do you love this script?

Do you love your character?

</line>


<line>
Do I love <name type="ORG">Internal Affairs</name> Director

<name type="ORG">Sassy</name> Malone,

</line>


<line>
whose primary character traits

are that she hates bras

</line>


<line>
and loves cold rooms?

</line>


<line>
Not especially.

It feels gratuitous and male-gazey.

</line>


<line>
But it pays for my expensive habit

of having a mortgage

</line>


<line>
-in <name type="NORP">Southern</name> <name type="GPE">California</name>.

-You don't have to go.

</line>


<line>
We could hang out.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure you don't wanna be all alone

in a house by yourself.

</line>


<line>
No, I love being alone.

I wish I were alone right now.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[Hollyhock grunts]</nonVerbComm> <ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>? Why are you up?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I could ask you the same question.

</line>


<line>
Now you're in college

you don't need to sleep anymore?

</line>


<line>
<ital>No, I was sleeping.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You called me and woke me up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
I wanted you to know

that I hearted your <name type="ORG">Instagram</name> photo.

</line>


<line>
Okay, cool.

</line>


<line>
Well, there were 23 other hearts.

</line>


<line>
But I don't know if you know

who they're all from, but one was from me.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, they let me know.

</line>


<line>
Oh, cool, cool.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm going back to sleep.

</line>


<line>
Fine, but this phone call does not replace

our weekly Sunday call. Okay?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'll talk to you Sunday afternoon.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Good. Because I miss you.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, that sounded dumb.

I don't miss you, I'm just bored.

</line>


<line>
-That also sounded dumb.

<ital>-I miss you too, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Good morning, lovebugs!

</line>


<line>
Don't mind me, just passing through!

Not sneaking a peek at the lovebugs!

</line>


<line>
There's nothing to see

that would embarrass any of us.

</line>


<line>
-We are all fully clothed.

-Ha-ha. If you say so!

</line>


<line>
What are you gonna do

while I'm at work all day?

</line>


<line>
There's an old frog

who lives down in the L.A. River.

</line>


<line>
He owes me an egg salad sandwich,

on account of a caper we once went on.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I was gonna see if he wants

to make instruments out of shoeboxes

and rubber bands.

</line>


<line>
And, uh, that will satisfy you?

</line>


<line>
When your life is ends,

and you're looking back at this day,

you'll think that was a good day?

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Well, from your preliminary paperwork

you seem like a perfect candidate.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, I just never thought

it would be like this.

</line>


<line>
I mean, my mom popped out kids

by the dozen. And I can't even--

</line>


<line>
Mnh-mnh. Princess Carolyn,

is your name <name type="PERSON">Cutie Cutie</name> Cupcake?

</line>


<line>
-No, that's--

-Were you born on August 12th, 1947?

</line>


<line>
-I--

-Do you sleep with your hands stuffed

</line>


<line>
-in lotion-filled socks?

-No.

</line>


<line>
Right, because you are not your mother.

</line>


<line>
-How did you know--

-What you are is noble,

honorable, and unimpeachable.

</line>


<line>
Anyone can just have a baby.

But to adopt one? That takes a hero.

</line>


<line>
It takes a selfless, giving,

kickass superwoman

who's willing to take out

her checkbook right now

and write the adoption agency

a check for $60,000.

</line>


<line>
Well. [sighs] Okay.

</line>


<line>
Fabulous.

</line>


<line>
I'm just so glad

that I'm on this journey with you.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

I'm with you every step of the way,

from you giving me this check

all the way to me introducing you

to your new caseworker, <name type="PERSON">Tracy</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Ah!

</line>


<line>
You're in wonderful hands, bye!

</line>


<line>
Uh, what--

</line>


<line>
Congratulations. What are you,

like, five months pregnant?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not a birth mother. I'm adopting.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that makes sense.

'Cause you're so old.

</line>


<line>
Is Mikhaela ever coming back?

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs] Yeah, in your dreams.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What?!

</line>


<line>
Jeanine, the script

calls for hot and haunted.

</line>


<line>
Does this girl look hot

and haunted to you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm sure she was hot

for <ital><name type="PERSON">Shakespeare</name> in the Park,</ital>

but I need TV hot.

</line>


<line>
-Actually, she's starting to look haunted.

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Uh, this a bad time?

-It's fine.

</line>


<line>
I can talk to you and also judge

these women's bodies at the same time.

</line>


<line>
What do you want?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, first of all,

the script is great.

</line>


<line>
Really top-notch stuff.

I love the whole... thing of it.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to clarify some things

about Philbert as a character.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, on page three,

is it necessary that Philbert

can only orgasm if he's listening

</line>


<line>
-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, what about this thing

on page eight

where he goes to a strip club and just

sits in the back with a sketch-pad

and draws the strippers,

while a Leonard Cohen song plays?

</line>


<line>
What about it?

</line>


<line>
It's just that

all of these half-naked women.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I understand it.

</line>


<line>
I'm just worried it might come across

as gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey,

which I know it isn't!

</line>


<line>
Hmm. You know what? You girls can go home.

</line>


<line>
The stripper scene's cut.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Seriously?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, oh. Uh...

-How am I gonna feed my baby?

</line>


<line>
I just got an idea for something better.

</line>


<line>
So, instead of drawing strippers naked,

you're just going to draw <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> naked.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> Uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> was concerned the old scene

was gratuitous and male-gazey.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he was? <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> said that?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> This is much more interesting

and motivated by character.

</line>


<line>
And since it's motivated by character,

that means it's not gratuitous.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for the note, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

you really helped.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Thanks, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, for helping.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, um...

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] Can we get some ice?

</line>


<line>
Can we get some nipple ice for <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>?

</line>


<line>
-So, you're the famous <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>.

-I am not famous.

</line>


<line>
You might have me confused

with another more famous <name type="PERSON">Yolanda</name>.

</line>


<line>
I know, I-I just meant

because <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> talks about you so much,

</line>


<line>
I feel like you're famous.

</line>


<line>
Oh, well, that was not clear.

</line>


<line>
Okay. <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, why don't you say things now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Steve</name>, you still fixing up your truck?

</line>


<line>
You're thinking of <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>'s old boyfriend,

firefighter <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> D'Marco.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm firefighter <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> D'Mazio.

We're very different.

</line>


<line>
But I do have a truck,

and I'm fixing it up.

</line>


<line>
So, thanks for asking.

</line>


<line>
I created a dating app

for firefighters to meet me.

</line>


<line>
-Looks like it worked.

-[chuckles] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Hey! We should create a dating app

for asexuals.

</line>


<line>
Why would asexuals want a dating app?

</line>


<line>
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Think of it this way.

</line>


<line>
One could be: A, Romantic,

or B, Aromantic,

while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.

</line>


<line>
So you could be BB, or BA.

</line>


<line>
As for me, see AB, see?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
So, even within the one percent

of the population that's asexual,

there's an even smaller percentage

that is still looking

for romantic companionship.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a pretty thin user base

for an app.

</line>


<line>
But without it, asexual romantics

might end up settling for just whatever

other asexual romantics they might meet,

even if they have nothing else in common.

</line>


<line>
-Well, anyway--

-Yeah, but maybe it's good

if they have nothing in common

because then they can help each other grow

and change, and become fuller,

more well-rounded people.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's true.

</line>


<line>
So, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, are you still doing

that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart

when the clowns got loose.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mystery music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I know you killed your wife, Philbert,</ital>

<ital>and I'm gonna prove it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> Wow!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Don't finger me for a murderer, Malone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I don't know</ital>

<ital>where those fingers have been.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> Ooh!

</line>


<line>
Well, how about I show you?

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Wow!

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] Cut!

</line>


<line>
Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."

</line>


<line>
You guys are doing a bang-up job

over here.

</line>


<line>
So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes!

</line>


<line>
Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay?

</line>


<line>
You're trying to punish me.

Just don't punish <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying to punish anyone.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to make a good show

that's brilliant and unprecedented.

</line>


<line>
It sounds like you guys

are basically on the same page.

</line>


<line>
You're the only one with a problem here.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> is fine with it.

-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> is not fine with it.

</line>


<line>
You guys, you're almost saying

exactly the same thing.

</line>


<line>
Except one of you is saying "not".

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, do you have a problem

with the nudity in this scene?

</line>


<line>
It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented.

I'm gonna get some potatoes.

</line>


<line>
You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.

</line>


<line>
So, can we drop it?

</line>


<line>
I know you're used to being

the most important person on set.

</line>


<line>
-This is not about me.

-It's weird for you

that I don't need to listen.

</line>


<line>
-I'm not--

-Hey, hey--

</line>


<line>
But if you actually have notes

that are helpful,

</line>


<line>
I would love to hear them when

you're done swinging your dick around.

</line>


<line>
-No, this is not about my dick.

-Okay, fellas...

</line>


<line>
-Well, maybe it should be about your dick.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Since you're so concerned

about the male gaze,

let's give the females

something to gaze at.

</line>


<line>
We'll do a full-frontal nude scene

with you.

</line>


<line>
This is compromise!

This is working together.

</line>


<line>
-Well, hold on.

-Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up

</line>


<line>
-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
He totters in little circles

on a tiny stool.

</line>


<line>
-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?

-Full body rotation. We see everything.

</line>


<line>
Now we're talking!

</line>


<line>
-No, we're not! Princess--

-I'm on it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> can only do this scene

</line>


<line>
-if he can wear a T-shirt.

-What?

</line>


<line>
He's very self-conscious

about his belly area.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm self-conscious

about my penis area.

</line>


<line>
He can't wear a shirt.

</line>


<line>
It's about being vulnerable.

</line>


<line>
We see every fold and imperfection

of his wrinkled, saggy body.

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-So we like him.

</line>


<line>
But he has to be fully erect

so we respect him.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-We'll shoot it tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Unless you don't like this idea,

in which case, we can go back

to what we were doing.

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-Well--

</line>


<line>
So, you would be admitting

that you don't actually care

about the male gaze

and you were only giving me notes

to hear yourself talk.

</line>


<line>
But that's not it, right?

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-Great.

</line>


<line>
-Shooting is tomorrow afternoon.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.

-Philbert waxes?

</line>


<line>
Not for cosmetic purposes.

He just wants to feel something.

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles]

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
I like your friend.

It's impressive how she creates companies.

</line>


<line>
And her boyfriend has

an interesting career as well.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! And you have an interesting career.

</line>


<line>
Hey! The three of you

all have interesting careers.

</line>


<line>
That is so cool!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, do you ever feel weird

that you have

no discernible life direction?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Let me rephrase that.

</line>


<line>
I feel weird that you have

no discernible life direction.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-I mean...

</line>


<line>
-What am I supposed to tell people?

-A story? A joke?

</line>


<line>
Compliments are things

people like being told sometimes.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. How was your day?

Did you end up meeting with that frog?

</line>


<line>
No, I just stayed home

and looked at stuff on the Internet.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

-Hello, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
You're not Princess Carolyn.

Why are you not Princess Carolyn?

<line>
-She gets home pretty late.

-I came all this way for nothing?

</line>


<line>
I brought my spinny chair

and everything!

</line>


<line>
Well, if you want something to do,

you could help me find a job.

</line>


<line>
-You're looking for a job?

-I spent all day looking!

</line>


<line>
First, I thought

I should get a newspaper to find one,

but then I was, like,

"Where do I find a newspaper?"

</line>


<line>
-Uh.

-So, I looked it up.

</line>


<line>
And a map came up of my local area.

</line>


<line>
So, then I thought about

how I know this area pretty well,

but there's all kinds of areas

I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Like South <name type="LOC">Africa</name>.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-And then I thought about <name type="PERSON">Charlize Theron</name>.

-Uh, right.

</line>


<line>
And then I thought about

that movie <ital>Monster.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And then I was, like,

"What year did that come out?"

</line>


<line>
-So I went to Monster.com...

-[pc clacking]

</line>


<line>
...to look up facts

about the movie <ital>Monster,</ital>

and it turns out

they have job postings there!

</line>


<line>
-[Bojack sups]

-What a time to be alive!

</line>


<line>
Hey! A posting for

WhatTimeIsItRightNow.com!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, a janitor job.

</line>


<line>
I've always wanted to... <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>!

</line>


<line>
I just got an amazing idea.

Interview for that job!

</line>


<line>
Uh... Was that your amazing idea?

</line>


<line>
Because I feel, like,

it kinda came out of the room.

</line>


<line>
When you get in the building,

say you need to use the WC.

</line>


<line>
Then you'll sneak into the office

of one of the network execs.

</line>


<line>
Go into their email

and send a message to <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> McVicker

telling him he can't film

any more nude scenes

because they're derivative

and unnecessary,

</line>


<line>
-especially the nude scenes involving me.

-You are throwing a lotta words at me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, don't you get it?

We're gonna save the show!

</line>


<line>
You're on a show?

</line>


<line>
This is a very impressive resume.

</line>


<line>
Yep. Now, if you'll excuse me,

I must adjourn to the restroom.

</line>


<line>
You founded a ride-share app.

You built and managed your own theme park.

</line>


<line>
And you were, briefly,

Governor of <name type="GPE">California</name>!

</line>


<line>
I was also the director

of a <ital>Star Wars</ital> movie,

but they fired me

over "creative differences."

</line>


<line>
Now about that restroom...

</line>


<line>
Hold on. You are way overqualified

to be a janitor.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. But I do actually need to go.

-Oh, you need to go, all right.

</line>


<line>
-Straight to the top of this company!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
We're ready for you on set, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
Just a minute.

</line>


<line>
-[cell phone rings]

-All right! <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, did you do it?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman on phone]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Hold please for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Already I don't like this development.

-[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>] <ital>Hey! Good news, bad news.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Good news is I'm now President</ital>

<ital>of Ad Sales and Streamable Content</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>for WhatTimeIsItRightNow.com and...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-WhatTimeIsItGo.

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] <ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Bad news is I can't help you.

</line>


<line>
Why not? You're their boss now.

You can tell them what to do.

</line>


<line>
I could, but I'm no leader at all

if I can't delegate authority.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I need to focus on big picture stuff.</ital>

-[grinding]

</line>


<line>
Loving that picture.

Can we get it even bigger?

</line>


<line>
Ugh, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, your good-hearted naiveté

has once again conspired

with outrageous happenstance

to completely dick me over!

</line>


<line>
Have you tried just talking

to the show runner?

</line>


<line>
In my experience,

I've found it's best to shoot straight,

in the boardroom and on the driving range.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-<ital> I gotta jet.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">Susie</name> in HRs birthday

and if I don't show up to these things,

people talk, you know what I mean?

</line>


<line>
-I never do!

-[cell phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, we need to talk.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-I'm not doing the naked scene.

-What?

</line>


<line>
The only reason you wrote it

is to embarrass me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I'm not writing scenes

for my television show

and also directing them

in order to teach you lessons

or send you secret messages.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to make a good show.

</line>


<line>
-Why do you keep making it so difficult?

-I'm making it difficult?

</line>


<line>
I have done nothing,

but be a friend to you.

</line>


<line>
I actually called my mom last night

and told her that I made a friend on set.

</line>


<line>
Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother?

</line>


<line>
-What? Ew. Weird.

-Take off that robe and go to set.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Take off that robe right now.

</line>


<line>
Why can't you act like a professional

and get naked?

</line>


<line>
Because it's dumb!

This whole show is duuuuuuumb!

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
It's confusing, it's overwritten,

and it's poorly lit.

</line>


<line>
The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!

</line>


<line>
And worst of all, it's boring!

</line>


<line>
It has nothing to say,

and it says that nothing badly!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales]</nonVerbComm> Let me tell you

how this is going to be.

</line>


<line>
I am the show creator

and if I want your character to get naked,

he gets naked.

</line>


<line>
If I want him to speak only in <name type="NORP">Korean</name>,

you're learning <name type="NORP">Korean</name>.

</line>


<line>
If I want your character to shit his pants

and walk around with shit in his pants

for the rest of the season,

</line>


<line>
-you will do just that.

-[mystery music]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, come on.

-You signed a contract.

</line>


<line>
And that means I am your god.

</line>


<line>
You will please your god,

and if I don't see your ass on set

then I will see your ass in court.

</line>


<line>
Do you understand?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
That's a good note about the lighting.

I'll take a look at that.

</line>


<line>
Good news! We found a birth mother!

</line>


<line>
Really? A-already?

</line>


<line>
She came in yesterday.

</line>


<line>
She's giving her baby

to a sweet couple in Illinois.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
Did you think we found

a birth mother for you?

</line>


<line>
Conceited much?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Tracy</name>, I’m spending a lot of money

to be here with you

and I'm putting myself

in a very vulnerable position.

</line>


<line>
Is there any way

you can be a little more thoughtful

with the way you manage me as a client?

</line>


<line>
It sounds like what you're looking for

is an adoption manager.

</line>


<line>
This is an adoption agency.

</line>


<line>
-Do you not know the difference?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-[cell phone buzzes]

-What?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, I overplayed my hand.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and I got into a fight.

</line>


<line>
-And he never showed up on set.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-[horn blaring]

-What?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> Princess Carolyyyyyyyn,

I need to talk to youuuuuu.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

-Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.

</line>


<line>
How did you even find me?

</line>


<line>
Duh. Bought a burner phone,

slipped it into your purse,

and then used the Find My Phone app.

</line>


<line>
How thoughtful.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[deep voice]</nonVerbComm> Hello, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
I have a plan and I need your help.

</line>


<line>
-I found out his mom has a fake leg.

-Who's mom?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>. I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg,

and then smack him across the face with it

until he chokes on his own blood.

</line>


<line>
It's subtle,

but I think he'll get the message.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, what are you trying

to accomplish here?

</line>


<line>
I-I don't want to do the show.

</line>


<line>
So you're gonna run away

like you always do?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I never wanted to do this show!

</line>


<line>
-You faked my signature!

-And I told you that,

and you said, "Okay" because you wanted

to be a good friend to me!

</line>


<line>
So, you can't get points for that

and then resent me for it now.

</line>


<line>
-It's not about you! I don't like him!

-Oh, <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>'s not that bad.

</line>


<line>
He's just insecure

and is overcompensating a little.

</line>


<line>
I know that must be

a foreign concept for you.

</line>


<line>
No, not <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>. Philbert.

</line>


<line>
He-he's a drunk.

He's an asshole. I don't want to be him.

</line>


<line>
So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.

</line>


<line>
Maybe this time, you have a good attitude

and you don't drink so much

and you show up at your call time.

</line>


<line>
And then you put on the Philbert costume

and you <ital>pretend </ital>to be this other guy.

</line>


<line>
And then when you're done shooting,

you take off your costume

and you're <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, the star of the show

that everybody likes.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Hey, why are we at an adoption agency?

Are you adopting something?

</line>


<line>
-I'm trying to.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
So, can you keep it together

for the next ten weeks

so I don't need to come to set,

every day, to put out fires?

</line>


<line>
You think you could do that? For me?

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hey, stranger.

</line>


<line>
It sounds like you had an amazing trip.

</line>


<line>
I did. What have you been up to?

</line>


<line>
Well, I did play <name type="PERSON">Julius Caesar</name>

in a pizza commercial

that they're going to... [chuckles]

...get this, show in movie theaters.

</line>


<line>
Wow, look at you. Pizza.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Et Cru-Dités?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-That was my line.

</line>


<line>
I played <name type="PERSON">Little Caesar</name>'s dad, Big Caesar,

in the back story part of the commercial,

which is funny because most commercials

don't even have a back story part.

</line>


<line>
Also, <name type="PERSON">Little Caesar</name>'s

doesn't sell crudités.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, my part's definitely going

to get cut, huh?

</line>


<line>
Just like the real Caesar!

</line>


<line>
Hey, that's right!

</line>


<line>
-Well, here's your place.

-[horns honking]

</line>


<line>
Yep. Here it is.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, I signed the papers.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Great!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, so if it all looks good to you

and your lawyer,

you can sign it too

and then it'll be official.

</line>


<line>
Divorce completed.

</line>


<line>
-Yay.

-We did it.

</line>


<line>
Take that, our marriage!

</line>


<line>
-Well, I guess I'll see you around?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-I was going to--

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
-[both laughing]

-Sorry. Just go all the way.

</line>


<line>
-Well, bye.

-Cool.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> And, cut.

</line>


<line>
-[buzzes]

-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] We got it.

</line>


<line>
What's that for? We've all seen me naked.

</line>


<line>
Can't put the genie

back in the bottle now, baby.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crew laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thanks anyway, <name type="PERSON">Judy</name>.

</line>


<line>
This is great. Any other work environment

<line>
and this would be considered

sexual harassment.

-Ooh, <name type="ORG">Cadbury Creme Eggs</name>.

<line>
Yes, please!

Whoops. <name type="PERSON">Gonna</name> need new yogurt.

about the naked stuff.

-Everything worked out.

how to strike the right tone.

</line>


<line>
No, of course, I'm just trying

Yeah. The main thing

you gotta know about me

is just don't take things so personal,

you know what I mean?
