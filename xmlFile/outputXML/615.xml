<line>
What you got there?

</line>


<line>
I think it's a hydrangea.

</line>


<line>
Does she even like that kind of plant?

</line>


<line>
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

</line>


<line>
Hello, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for having me, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the guest of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor.

<line>
Everyone, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is here.

<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] Hey, buddy! Get in here!

-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> giggles]

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got here just in time, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
A bird flew in through the window

and we're having trouble

getting her out of the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Yeah, call yourself early

and go get a worm!

</line>


<line>
Golly, she's more coy

than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>. <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne for you, Mrs. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, butler.

-Is that <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mean my butler?

-At your service!

</line>


<line>
I actually was friends with <name type="PERSON">Donald</name>

in real life.

</line>


<line>
He's a spectacular man--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Butler</name>!

-Sorry! <name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne call for you.

</line>


<line>
I'll take it in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, make yourself useful for a change

and help, will ya?

</line>


<line>
With the bird?

</line>


<line>
Hello? Oh, it's you.

</line>


<line>
All right. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat does it! [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

<name type="PERSON">Son</name> of a--!

</line>


<line>
With a drop like that,

</line>


<line>
you'd think she was the ratings

for <ital><name type="PERSON">Veronica</name>'s Closet</ital>

</line>


<line>
when it moved to <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ndays.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Comedy poison.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants to laugh on a <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>nday?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BJ</name>! Finally made it

to our little soirée, huh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I kept having this dream

where I was having dinner

</line>


<line>
with all the people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> were gone

and I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught, "I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld do that!"

</line>


<line>
So, here I am.

</line>


<line>
-We've got to flank her from the left.

-[bird] <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
Hello. Cracker<name type="PERSON">jack</name>?

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

</line>


<line>
-[bird giggles]

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
Hey! What's up, man?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>. [sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers] <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d to...

</line>


<line>
Still weirded out because the last time

you saw me I was naked,

</line>


<line>
hanging from my i<name type="ORG">P<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>ne charger,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>lding a lemon, with a very erect penis

</line>


<line>
despite being deceased in my trailer

for over an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur?

</line>


<line>
Yep.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have to get over that, buddy.

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. Mm. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-What are you...? Stop that.

-Oh! Oh, sorry.

</line>


<line>
Forgot where I was for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hink this'll help?

-Kid's got the right idea.

</line>


<line>
We can chuck the c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ker

and spook her with this poker!

</line>


<line>
-S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w her w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s boss!

-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>] Ruffle her feathers!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Get her to the kitchen!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
And that!

</line>


<line>
-All right!

-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] Go!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Cracker<name type="PERSON">jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ha-cha!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> cheers]

-[all w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oping]

</line>


<line>
Yes, yes, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> bullied a bird.

Bully for him.

</line>


<line>
Speaking of useless,

my husband is r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning late,

so we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> start dinner wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut him.

</line>


<line>
He'll be here before the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w starts,

won't he?

</line>


<line>
He'd better be.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime,

let's adjourn to the dining room

</line>


<line>
before our dinners get

as cold as my parenting style.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I think mine would be

the first time someone asked

for my autograph.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Oh, wow!

</line>


<line>
I didn't even know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to write my name!

</line>


<line>
I just drew a squiggle!

</line>


<line>
-Water?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u only get to give

your first autograph once, you know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time it becomes an obli<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tion,

the third time a c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>re.

</line>


<line>
But the first time...

[sighs] <name type="PERSON">T</name>he first time... [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-Hey. What is that?

-Ah, ah, ah.

</line>


<line>
Shh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>] Mm.

-Okay. My turn.

</line>


<line>
Mine was also when I signed

on a dotted line to enlist.

</line>


<line>
Are you ready to sing "<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>llypop <name type="PERSON">Son</name>g"

in the big s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w later?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know I never make it to the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know then that enlisting

would lead to my two worst parts.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have two?

I didn't know we could pick two.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>, it's a conversation,

not an assignment.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>] In that case, I have three.

-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] <name type="PERSON">T</name>hree is way too many.

</line>


<line>
My worst parts were saying goodbye

to my mother

and seeing a bullet go straight

through my general's face,

right before it hit my own.

</line>


<line>
-[all <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sp]

-At least your death was instantaneous.

</line>


<line>
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV

from when I had cancer.

</line>


<line>
-Drip. Drip.

-Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>] What about you, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

-What?

</line>


<line>
Best part, worst part, what about you?

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess my worst part

has to be, um...

</line>


<line>
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

</line>


<line>
I went to <name type="PERSON">Angela</name> <name type="PERSON">Di</name>az's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gulps, spits]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Does anyone else's water

taste like chlorine?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>, can I get

some different water over here?

</line>


<line>
Right away, Mr. <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
Cracker<name type="PERSON">jack</name>, do you think your death

meant something

because it was in the service

of a greater cause?

</line>


<line>
-Aw, shucks.

-Of course it meant something.

</line>


<line>
I think questions like that are too big

for a little soldier like me.

</line>


<line>
My brother <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve the ultimate sacrifice.

</line>


<line>
-Because sometimes I wonder--

-But see, this is where I get h<name type="ORG">un</name>g up,

because when we valorize

the idea of sacrifice,

</line>


<line>
-of loss, of <name type="GPE">suffering--</name>

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, don't start with this a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
When we grow up

in a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use that does that,

we internalize this idea

that being happy is a selfish act,

but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>] Yes, it does.

-Sacrifice?

</line>


<line>
In the service of something greater,

maybe, but just in and of itself?

</line>


<line>
-What's the good in that?

-A lot.

</line>


<line>
Sacrifice is good.

</line>


<line>
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,

and I was freaking awesome.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve everything.

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve my w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u died in a hedonistic bender.

</line>


<line>
I'm not talking about my death.

</line>


<line>
I'm talking about my life.

I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve my w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life.

</line>


<line>
If we get into everyone's w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life,

we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be here all night.

</line>


<line>
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"

not "Everything <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat Ever Happened."

</line>


<line>
Okay, worst part:

the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin <name type="PERSON">T</name>our."

</line>


<line>
My manager leaked nudes

to get more tour dates added,

my mom pointed out every carb I ate,

it was hell.

</line>


<line>
But it <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve millions of fans

a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w they will never forget.

</line>


<line>
And that is worth something.

</line>


<line>
No, that's a high you chase.

</line>


<line>
-It was not.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think you singing songs on stage

is the same thing as this guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> died liberating the camps?

</line>


<line>
We don't need to compare

apples to <name type="ORG">Auschwitzes</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, tell 'em. It means something--

the work we do, the joy we bring.

</line>


<line>
It has to, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>y, I sure t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught so.

I-I used to really believe in it.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport

during a snowstorm

on the eve of the dance championship

guest starring <name type="PERSON">Greg</name>ory Hines" episode

away from an E<name type="PERSON">mm</name>y.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I lost it all.

</line>


<line>
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing

this leak?

</line>


<line>
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he drips are hitting me!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen you'll <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld the bucket.

</line>


<line>
But the f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny thing is,

it wasn't <name type="ORG">un</name>til I got fired

that I actually became myself.

</line>


<line>
I was out of the closet. I was free.

I was authentically me.

</line>


<line>
What does being authentic

have to do with anything?

</line>


<line>
Well, when I wasn't hiding

behind some facade, I could be at peace.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's when I really got

into philanthropy.

</line>


<line>
-Can I ask you something, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

-Why do people say that?

</line>


<line>
If you're asking it, then yes,

you can and you will and you just did.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, why are we anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cing our questions?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?

-[imitates fanfare]

</line>


<line>
Anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cing King and Queen Query

of the Interro<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tive Isle.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>y I ask you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you do?

</line>


<line>
-Very well, thanks.

-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

</line>


<line>
I didn't ask you yet.

I asked if I could ask you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you get pleasure

from your charity work?

</line>


<line>
Like real, deep pleasure?

</line>


<line>
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

</line>


<line>
Doesn't co<name type="ORG">un</name>t then.

If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

</line>


<line>
And it's only good if it's selfless.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> made up that rule? I helped people.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares if it made me feel good, too?

</line>


<line>
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

</line>


<line>
If I'd given myself to Christ,

truly went down the path--

</line>


<line>
I don't care for this talk of religion

in my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
If I wasn't constantly

trying to feel good, get it better,

always looking for maximum pleasure...

[sighs] <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was my worst part.

</line>


<line>
Well, one of the three worst parts.

Wait, actually, can I have four?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>scovering you in your trailer

definitely cracks my top five.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is bullshit!

</line>


<line>
I did a lot for a lot of people!

I was not a bad person.

</line>


<line>
No one is accusing you

of being a bad person, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[yelling]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u all are

with your "being authentic"

and "charity work" and "killing <name type="NORP">Nazi</name>s."

</line>


<line>
I actually never killed a <name type="NORP">Nazi</name>.

All my kills were friendly fire.

</line>


<line>
I also never liberated any camps.

I'm <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly not sure what I did.

</line>


<line>
Here you go.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur husband just pulled up, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s here?

He's never made it to dinner before.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, here's a question.

-Another question has arrived!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d any of you have a song of yours

played in outer space?

</line>


<line>
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught.

</line>


<line>
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"

is making its way to <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rs!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat means something.

I will be remembered.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat has to mean something. I will be--

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
Sorry I'm late. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I miss the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here he is! <name type="PERSON">T</name>here's our guy!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>!

-I...

</line>


<line>
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.

It's not like we have anywhere to be.

</line>


<line>
Why s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't we all bend ourselves

to your schedule?

</line>


<line>
I already apologized. I was r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning.

</line>


<line>
Yes. As always, r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning late,

while I was r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning myself ragged

trying to get dinner on the table.

</line>


<line>
-[clears throat]

-Yes, you helped.

</line>


<line>
And now I'm r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning out of patience

for you r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning your mouth.

</line>


<line>
And I'm r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning out the clock

<name type="ORG">un</name>til we both...

</line>


<line>
Well. Here we are.

</line>


<line>
I'll just squeeze in here.

</line>


<line>
-Get yourself something nice.

-Ooh! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, Mr. <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

</line>


<line>
-What'd I miss?

-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

</line>


<line>
Ooh! I got one! <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>chu Picchu.

</line>


<line>
When I left "<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,"

I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about killing myself.

</line>


<line>
Shit, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>. Really?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But the <name type="PERSON">Knick</name>s

were having a good season

and I wanted to see what happened.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

because the <name type="PERSON">Knick</name>s

were having a good season?

</line>


<line>
What would you have done

if they were having a bad season?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. <name type="PERSON">Gotten</name> into baseball?

</line>


<line>
Oh, for the love...

Where's your follow-through?

</line>


<line>
It's like you didn't even

wanna kill yourself!

</line>


<line>
And I'm so glad I didn't.

</line>


<line>
Because there I was ten years later

at <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>chu Picchu

and I realized there was so much more

I could do in a life.

</line>


<line>
Okay, my turn.

</line>


<line>
August 22nd, 1973,

I was banned from r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning ever a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
And r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning, well, that was the only thing

that ever made sense to me,

</line>


<line>
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.

-[<name type="PERSON">coughin</name>g]

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is your worst part?

-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>.

-What did I say about the <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> talk?

</line>

It was my c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice.

I got to go on my own terms.

-Oh, uh, I don't know.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his past year I took a teaching job.

</line>


<line>
And I had this one student

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was really struggling,

just couldn't get over this hump.

</line>


<line>
And what, you helped him

do good in a scene? For your class?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the best part of your w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> put me

on the spot like this!

</line>


<line>
Come on, buddy.

What was so special about that moment?

</line>


<line>
It felt good to help someone do something.

</line>


<line>
See? Helping someone, like I said!

</line>


<line>
But he liked it because it felt good,

like I said!

</line>


<line>
I liked it because it reminded me

of when I was yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g, just starting out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u and me, screwing aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

hitting up open mics.

</line>
