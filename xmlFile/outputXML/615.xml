</line>


<line>
What you got there?

</line>


<line>
I think it's a hydrangea.

</line>


<line>
Does she even like that kind of plant?

</line>


<line>
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

</line>


<line>
Hello, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thanks for having me, Mom.

</line>


<line>
You're the guest of honor.

</line>


<line>
Everyone, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is here.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] Hey, buddy! Get in here!

-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> giggles]

</line>


<line>
-For you.

-Oh, a plant.

</line>


<line>
-Dirt for inside. Goody.

-[sighs]

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dripping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You got here just in time, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
A bird flew in through the window

and we're having trouble

getting her out of the house.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, call yourself early

and go get a worm!

</line>


<line>
Golly, she's more coy

than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

</line>


<line>
-Phone for you, Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

-[grunting]

</line>


<line>
Thank you, butler.

</line>


<line>
-Is that <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>?

-Who?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>. Actor, independent filmmaker,

real-life friend of <name type="PERSON">Donald</name> Faison?

</line>


<line>
-You mean my butler?

-At your service!

</line>


<line>
I actually was friends with <name type="PERSON">Donald</name>

in real life.

</line>


<line>
He's a spectacular man--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Butler</name>!

-Sorry! Phone call for you.

</line>


<line>
I'll take it in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, make yourself useful for a change

and help, will ya?

</line>


<line>
With the bird?

</line>


<line>
Hello? Oh, it's you.

</line>


<line>
All right. That does it! [grunts]

<name type="PERSON">Son</name> of a--!

</line>


<line>
With a drop like that,

</line>


<line>
you'd think she was the ratings

for <ital><name type="PERSON">Veronica</name>'s Closet</ital>

</line>


<line>
when it moved to Mondays.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Comedy poison.

Who wants to laugh on a Monday?

</line>


<line>
BJ! Finally made it

to our little soirée, huh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I kept having this dream

where I was having dinner

</line>


<line>
with all the people who were gone

and I thought, "I should do that!"

</line>


<line>
So, here I am.

</line>


<line>
-We've got to flank her from the left.

-[bird] Huh?

</line>


<line>
Hello. Crackerjack?

</line>


<line>
-That's what it says on my underpants!

-[giggles]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> The uncle I never met

and yet could never live up to!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

</line>


<line>
-[bird giggles]

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
Hey! What's up, man?

</line>


<line>
Hey, Good to...

</line>


<line>
Still weirded out because the last time

you saw me I was naked,

</line>


<line>
hanging from my iPhone charger,

holding a lemon, with a very erect penis

</line>


<line>
despite being deceased in my trailer

for over an hour?

</line>


<line>
Yep.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Hmm. Mm. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-What are you...? Stop that.

-Oh! Oh, sorry.

</line>


<line>
Forgot where I was for a second.

</line>


<line>
-Think this'll help?

-Kid's got the right idea.

</line>


<line>
We can chuck the choker

and spook her with this poker!

</line>


<line>
-Show her who's boss!

-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>] Ruffle her feathers!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>]</nonVerbComm> Get her to the kitchen!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And that!

</line>


<line>
-All right!

-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] Go!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Crackerjack]</nonVerbComm> Ha-cha!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> cheers]

-[all whooping]

</line>


<line>
Yes, yes, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> bullied a bird.

Bully for him.

</line>


<line>
Speaking of useless,

my husband is running late,

so we're gonna start dinner without him.

</line>


<line>
He'll be here before the show starts,

won't he?

</line>


<line>
He'd better be.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime,

let's adjourn to the dining room

</line>


<line>
before our dinners get

as cold as my parenting style.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>]</nonVerbComm> I think mine would be

the first time someone asked

for my autograph.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Oh, wow!

</line>


<line>
I didn't even know how to write my name!

</line>


<line>
I just drew a squiggle!

</line>


<line>
-Water?

-Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>.

</line>


<line>
You only get to give

your first autograph once, you know.

</line>


<line>
The second time it becomes an obligation,

the third time a chore.

</line>


<line>
But the first time...

[sighs] The first time... [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-Hey. What is that?

-Ah, ah, ah.

</line>


<line>
Shh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] Mm.

-Okay. My turn.

</line>


<line>
Mine was also when I signed

on a dotted line to enlist.

</line>


<line>
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"

in the big show later?

</line>


<line>
No, Mom.

You know I never make it to the show.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know then that enlisting

would lead to my two worst parts.

</line>


<line>
You have two?

I didn't know we could pick two.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>, it's a conversation,

not an assignment.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>] In that case, I have three.

-[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>] Three is way too many.

</line>


<line>
My worst parts were saying goodbye

to my mother

and seeing a bullet go straight

through my general's face,

right before it hit my own.

</line>


<line>
-[all gasp]

-At least your death was instantaneous.

</line>


<line>
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV

from when I had cancer.

</line>


<line>
-Drip. Drip.

-Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>] What about you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

-What?

</line>


<line>
Best part, worst part, what about you?

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess my worst part

has to be, um...

</line>


<line>
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

</line>


<line>
I went to <name type="PERSON">Angela</name> Diaz's house.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulps, spits]</nonVerbComm> Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Does anyone else's water

taste like chlorine?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>, can I get

some different water over here?

</line>


<line>
Right away, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
Crackerjack, do you think your death

meant something

because it was in the service

of a greater cause?

</line>


<line>
-Aw, shucks.

-Of course it meant something.

</line>


<line>
I think questions like that are too big

for a little soldier like me.

</line>


<line>
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.

</line>


<line>
-Because sometimes I wonder--

-But see, this is where I get hung up,

because when we valorize

the idea of sacrifice,

</line>


<line>
-of loss, of suffering--

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, don't start with this again.

</line>


<line>
When we grow up

in a house that does that,

we internalize this idea

that being happy is a selfish act,

but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>] Yes, it does.

-Sacrifice?

</line>


<line>
In the service of something greater,

maybe, but just in and of itself?

</line>


<line>
-What's the good in that?

-A lot.

</line>


<line>
Sacrifice is good.

</line>


<line>
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,

and I was freaking awesome.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

</line>


<line>
I gave everything.

</line>


<line>
I gave my whole life.

</line>


<line>
You died in a hedonistic bender.

</line>


<line>
I'm not talking about my death.

</line>


<line>
I'm talking about my life.

I gave my whole life.

</line>


<line>
If we get into everyone's whole life,

we're gonna be here all night.

</line>


<line>
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"

not "Everything That Ever Happened."

</line>


<line>
Okay, worst part:

the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."

</line>


<line>
My manager leaked nudes

to get more tour dates added,

my mom pointed out every carb I ate,

it was hell.

</line>


<line>
But it gave millions of fans

a show they will never forget.

</line>


<line>
And that is worth something.

</line>


<line>
No, that's a high you chase.

</line>


<line>
-It was not.

-You think you singing songs on stage

is the same thing as this guy

who died liberating the camps?

</line>


<line>
We don't need to compare

apples to <name type="ORG">Auschwitzes</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, tell 'em. It means something--

the work we do, the joy we bring.

</line>


<line>
It has to, right?

</line>


<line>
Boy, I sure thought so.

I-I used to really believe in it.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport

during a snowstorm

on the eve of the dance championship

guest starring Gregory Hines" episode

away from an Emmy.

</line>


<line>
Then I lost it all.

</line>


<line>
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing

this leak?

</line>


<line>
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

</line>


<line>
-The drips are hitting me!

-Then you'll hold the bucket.

</line>


<line>
But the funny thing is,

it wasn't until I got fired

that I actually became myself.

</line>


<line>
I was out of the closet. I was free.

I was authentically me.

</line>


<line>
What does being authentic

have to do with anything?

</line>


<line>
Well, when I wasn't hiding

behind some facade, I could be at peace.

</line>


<line>
That's when I really got

into philanthropy.

</line>


<line>
-Can I ask you something, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

-Why do people say that?

</line>


<line>
If you're asking it, then yes,

you can and you will and you just did.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?

-[imitates fanfare]

</line>


<line>
Announcing King and Queen Query

of the Interrogative Isle.

</line>


<line>
May I ask you how do you do?

</line>


<line>
-Very well, thanks.

-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

</line>


<line>
I didn't ask you yet.

I asked if I could ask you.

</line>


<line>
Did you get pleasure

from your charity work?

</line>


<line>
Like real, deep pleasure?

</line>


<line>
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

</line>


<line>
Doesn't count then.

If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

</line>


<line>
And it's only good if it's selfless.

</line>


<line>
Who made up that rule? I helped people.

</line>


<line>
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?

</line>


<line>
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

</line>


<line>
If I'd given myself to Christ,

truly went down the path--

</line>


<line>
I don't care for this talk of religion

in my house.

</line>


<line>
If I wasn't constantly

trying to feel good, get it better,

always looking for maximum pleasure...

[sighs] That was my worst part.

</line>


<line>
Well, one of the three worst parts.

Wait, actually, can I have four?

</line>


<line>
Discovering you in your trailer

definitely cracks my top five.

</line>


<line>
This is bullshit!

</line>


<line>
I did a lot for a lot of people!

I was not a bad person.

</line>


<line>
No one is accusing you

of being a bad person, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[yelling]</nonVerbComm> You are! You all are

with your "being authentic"

and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."

</line>


<line>
I actually never killed a <name type="NORP">Nazi</name>.

All my kills were friendly fire.

</line>


<line>
I also never liberated any camps.

I'm honestly not sure what I did.

</line>


<line>
Here you go.

Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
Wait, <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s here?

He's never made it to dinner before.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, here's a question.

-Another question has arrived!

</line>


<line>
Did any of you have a song of yours

played in outer space?

</line>


<line>
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

</line>


<line>
That's what I thought.

</line>


<line>
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"

is making its way to <name type="LOC">Mars</name>!

</line>


<line>
That means something.

I will be remembered.

</line>


<line>
-That has to mean something. I will be--

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-There he is! There's our guy!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>!

-I...

</line>


<line>
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.

It's not like we have anywhere to be.

</line>


<line>
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves

to your schedule?

</line>


<line>
I already apologized. I was running.

</line>


<line>
Yes. As always, running late,

while I was running myself ragged

trying to get dinner on the table.

</line>


<line>
-[clears throat]

-Yes, you helped.

</line>


<line>
And now I'm running out of patience

for you running your mouth.

</line>


<line>
And I'm running out the clock

until we both...

</line>


<line>
Well. Here we are.

</line>


<line>
I'll just squeeze in here.

</line>


<line>
-Get yourself something nice.

-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
-What'd I miss?

-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

</line>


<line>
Ooh! I got one! <name type="PERSON">Machu</name> Picchu.

</line>


<line>
When I left "Horsin' Around,"

I honestly thought about killing myself.

</line>


<line>
Shit, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>. Really?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But the <name type="ORG">Knicks</name>

were having a good season

and I wanted to see what happened.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

because the <name type="ORG">Knicks</name>

were having a good season?

</line>


<line>
What would you have done

if they were having a bad season?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. <name type="PERSON">Gotten</name> into baseball?

</line>


<line>
Oh, for the love...

Where's your follow-through?

</line>


<line>
It's like you didn't even

wanna kill yourself!

</line>


<line>
And I'm so glad I didn't.

</line>


<line>
Because there I was ten years later

at <name type="PERSON">Machu</name> Picchu

and I realized there was so much more

I could do in a life.

</line>


<line>
Okay, my turn.

</line>


<line>
August 22nd, 1973,

I was banned from running ever again.

</line>


<line>
And running, well, that was the only thing

that ever made sense to me,

</line>


<line>
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.

-[coughing]

</line>


<line>
-This is your worst part?

-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>.

-What did I say about the <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> talk?

</line>


<line>
It was my choice.

I got to go on my own terms.

</line>


<line>
Not a lot of people can say that.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-That's true.

</line>


<line>
The view from up there.

</line>


<line>
-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.

-[coughs]

</line>


<line>
-[all laughing]

-Oh, my.

</line>


<line>
-It must've been from swimming earlier.

-Oh, you were swimming?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I, um... [clears throat]

</line>


<line>
-When was I swimming?

-Don't think about that.

</line>


<line>
-Do you have a best part?

-Oh, uh, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
This past year I took a teaching job.

</line>


<line>
And I had this one student

who was really struggling,

just couldn't get over this hump.

</line>


<line>
And what, you helped him

do good in a scene? For your class?

</line>


<line>
That's the best part of your whole life?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you were gonna put me

on the spot like this!

</line>


<line>
Come on, buddy.

What was so special about that moment?

</line>


<line>
It felt good to help someone do something.

</line>


<line>
See? Helping someone, like I said!

</line>


<line>
But he liked it because it felt good,

like I said!

</line>


<line>
I liked it because it reminded me

of when I was young, just starting out.

</line>


<line>
You and me, screwing around,

hitting up open mics.

</line>


<line>
Trying to figure it out. I think...

</line>


<line>
-I think that was the best part.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Well, are we ready to start the show?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>] Let's do this!

-Okay, nice seeing you all!

</line>


<line>
You're not coming?

</line>


<line>
This is always the part where I wake up.

You all go to the show.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name> says "Pardon my reach"

even though he can clearly

get my plate from another angle.

</line>


<line>
-Then I wake up.

-Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
-Next time then. [sighs]

-[dripping]

</line>


<line>
Pardon my reach.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbComm> Hello, everyone!

Please take your seats.

</line>


<line>
Tonight's show is in honor

of <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>!

</line>


<line>
What do you say, huh?

Should we get this show started?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! Tonight's opener

needs no introduction,

but I'm gonna give her one anyway.

</line>


<line>
Ladies and gentlemen,

the one, the only, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>!

</line>


<line>
-[audience cheers, applauds]

-Thank you, thank you!

</line>


<line>
I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance

to the man of the hour, <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I'm so sorry

for everything that happened with you.

</line>


<line>
With us. I should have protected you...

</line>


<line>
Ah, ah, ah. <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. This is my time.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

<line>
Okay, performing

an interpretive aerial routine,

your friend and mine,

and a killer hang...

</line>


<line>
-[audience laughs]

-...<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name> <name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>-<name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Where did <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> go?

-Shh.

</line>


<line>
-Try to enjoy the show.

-[grunts] Ha!

</line>


<line>
-Where does this door go?

-Sit down, buddy. You'll get your turn.

</line>


<line>
-No, I need you to tell me-- What?

-Watch out!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> grunts]

-[<name type="ORG">Corduroy</name> grunts]

</line>


<line>
-[drumroll]

-[audience cheers]

</line>


<line>
That's a series wrap

on <name type="ORG">Corduroy</name> <name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>-<name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>!

</line>


<line>
Down in front, please?

</line>


<line>
All right,

let's keep this show going, huh?

</line>


<line>
Next up, you know him, you love him,

please a give a warm, warm,

burning hot welcome to...

</line>


<line>
-Hey. You wanna grab a smoke?

-...<name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Yes. Yeah, let's get out of here.

-[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Zach</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh-ho, whee! I'm honored.

Honored, honored.

</line>


<line>
So, what's on the other side of that door?

</line>


<line>
The nerve of that guy.

With the beard. <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
What, he says he's at peace?

'Cause why, <name type="PERSON">Machu</name> Picchu?

</line>


<line>
-I don't buy it.

-I don't know. I... I believe him.

</line>


<line>
I promise you,

every single person in that room

would go back if we could.

</line>


<line>
Peace? That's someone

trying to convince himself of something.

</line>


<line>
-Of what?

-That life has meaning or purpose, that...

that if you check the right boxes

and do the dance,

then you get a little parting gift

at the end,

a framed certificate that says,

"Congratulations, you've got peace."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I wouldn't mind that.

-But guess what?

</line>


<line>
All the time those people spent,

trying to do good or help people

or be something?

</line>


<line>
I did none of that shit,

and yet here I am, same as them.

</line>


<line>
You were the fastest runner in the world.

You inspired millions.

</line>


<line>
And yet, here I am, same as you.

</line>


<line>
So, if you could go back, do it again,

what would you do different?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> What would I do?

I wouldn't have cared so much.

</line>


<line>
Cared about what? Racing?

</line>


<line>
About everything.

</line>


<line>
I know this part is confusing

because I'm Secretariat

and also your dad for some reason,

but speaking as your dad,

it's important that you know that I cared.

</line>


<line>
No. You never cared.

You cared about your book.

</line>


<line>
You cared about getting drunk

and telling everyone

how miserable you were,

but that's not caring.

</line>


<line>
You think I didn't care

because I put up walls,

but I cared so much, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
About you, about your mother.

</line>


<line>
I wanted you to respect me.

I wanted you to love me.

</line>


<line>
I was so afraid that you would know that.

</line>


<line>
I cared so much.

</line>


<line>
It's a shame that we could never

talk like this in real life.

</line>


<line>
All the good it would have done.

</line>


<line>
Least we got the chance this time,

before I wake up.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wake up?

Oh, you're not getting it, are you?

</line>


<line>
Getting what?

</line>


<line>
Loss is a collaborative art,

between the people who leave us

and those who remain.

</line>


<line>
We dance with the shadows

of their absence.

</line>


<line>
-With that in mind, I present to you...

-[grunts] Stop the show!

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me.

-What's happening?

</line>


<line>
You're being very rude.

I was about to do my roller-dance routine.

</line>


<line>
-Calm down, son.

-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--

</line>


<line>
-No!

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!

</line>


<line>
I'm not ready. I never got to direct

my <ital>Backdraft</ital> remake:

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name>'s Backdraft"!

</line>


<line>
I never finished my memoir:

</line>


<line>
"I Started A <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> Which Started

The Whole World Braffing!"

</line>


<line>
I never got to license

the <name type="PERSON">Zach</name> <name type="PERSON">Braff</name> Short Stack

Breakfast Attack at Shake Shack!

</line>


<line>
Cash-strapped hash brown fans

who hashtag "<name type="PERSON">Zach</name>'s snacks"

get cash back fast

with the <name type="PERSON">Braff</name> Bucks app!

</line>


<line>
I need to wake up. I can't be here.

</line>


<line>
Of course. Everything's always about you.

</line>


<line>
-BJ, buddy...

-<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>! How did I get here?

</line>


<line>
How the hell should I know?

</line>


<line>
I broke into my house.

But it wasn't my house anymore.

</line>


<line>
I was... I was watching

the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more

and I found some pills.

</line>


<line>
And then I went swimming...

</line>


<line>
No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!

I got out of the pool.

</line>


<line>
Yes! And I called <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, we're trying to do a show here.

</line>


<line>
But I called <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't have drowned

if I got out of the pool to call <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>!

</line>


<line>
So, I shouldn't be here.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> If I could just finish

the conversation. Where's a phone?!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[pants]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

we have a real treat for you next.

</line>


<line>
A real treat.

</line>


<line>
Come and see him

before he makes a run for it.

</line>


<line>
-No! Stop!

-It's Secretariat!

</line>


<line>
Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle

won't change a thing.

</line>


<line>
This was gonna happen to you

one of these days.

</line>


<line>
A poem. Original, obviously.

</line>


<line>
It's called "The View from Halfway Down."

[clears throat]

</line>


<line>
"The weak breeze whispers nothing

The water screams sublime

</line>


<line>
His feet shift teeter-totter

Deep breath, stand back, it's time

</line>


<line>
Toes untouch the overpass

Soon he's water bound

</line>


<line>
Eyes locked shut but peek to see

The view from halfway down"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience applauds, cheers]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm not done. Hold on. I'm not done.

I'm not done. [clears throat]

</line>


<line>
"A little wind, a summer sun

A river rich and regal

</line>


<line>
A flood of fond endorphins

Brings a calm that knows no equal

</line>


<line>
You're flying now

</line>


<line>
You see things much more clear

Than from the ground

</line>


<line>
It's all okay, it would be

Were you not now halfway down

</line>


<line>
Thrash to break from gravity

</line>


<line>
What now could slow the drop?

</line>


<line>
All I'd give for toes to touch

The safety back at top"

</line>


<line>
I change my mind. [stammers]

I change my mind. I don't wanna--

</line>


<line>
It's okay.

</line>


<line>
"But this is it, the deed is done

</line>


<line>
Silence drowns the sound

</line>


<line>
Before I leaped I should have seen

The view from halfway down

</line>


<line>
No! I really should have thought

About the view from halfway down"

</line>


<line>
Find your peace, big guy. Find it.

</line>


<line>
"I wish I could have known

About the view from halfway down--"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I need to get out of here!

</line>


<line>
-Wha--

-BJ, where do you think you're going?

</line>


<line>
Nothing you do in here matters, pal.

</line>


<line>
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna

pull your body out of that pool,

</line>


<line>
-so you might as well just--

-Sit down! [echoes]

</line>


<line>
But I...

</line>


<line>
Look, BJ, it's possible that someone

is going to find you and save you,

and it's also possible that someone won't.

</line>


<line>
We don't get to know.

</line>


<line>
Can I ask you a question?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[imitates fanfare]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Has anyone ever come back from this place?

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[mic feedback]

</line>


<line>
BJ, there is no place.

</line>


<line>
It's just your brain going through

what it feels like it has to go through.

</line>


<line>
All you can do right now

is sit back and enjoy the show.

</line>


<line>

Okay. You ready for the headliner?

and a stupid piece of shit.

<line>
It's... <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>!

</line>


<line>
Is it terrifying?

</line>


<line>
No. I don't think so.

</line>


<line>
It's the way it is, you know?

</line>


<line>
Everything must come to an end,

the drip finally stops.

</line>


<line>
See you on the other side.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, no, there is no other side.

This is it.
