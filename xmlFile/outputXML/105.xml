I'm sorry, sir,

I'm actually a huge celebrity

for an important meeting

who wants to publish a book

Sir, whoever you are,

Really? You've never heard

You know very well who I am.

Relax, it's a lighter.

[all gasp]

How much lighter fluid

can I take on the plane?

</line>


<line>
And before you answer,

remember, I'm a celebrity.

I think the <name type="GPE">New York</name> air's

Excuse me.

Hurry back, superstar.

I don't think

What? Why?

Is <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> no good?

She's too good.

I don't know if <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> is

She's so...functional.

Oh, I'm so sorry,

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>,

Why don't I just

get on the phone

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[shouting]</nonVerbComm> What are you talking about?

This is a very bad time,

Sorry I took so long.

Who was that?

The library?

</line>


<line>
Thanking you for never

returning a book late?

</line>


<line>
That was my brother Tommy.

My dad just died.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Did we talk about firming up

the release date?

</line>


<line>
- I was thinking late September.

- I am so sorry.

</line>


<line>
It's fine, he was old

and also the worst.

</line>


<line>
Such a terrible tragedy

</line>


<line>
really puts everything

in perspective.

</line>


<line>
Where does that leave us

as far as the book of it all?

</line>


<line>
Not a problem.

</line>


<line>
I just got to swing by <name type="GPE">Boston</name>

</line>

Hey, so listen,

</line>


<line>
I really want to be here for you

in your time of need,

but I'm not really good

with funerals or death

or families or feelings

or people.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry.

You can wait in the car.

</line>


<line>
It's probably better

you don't meet my brothers.

</line>


<line>
They're narrow-minded,

mean-spirited dirtbags.

</line>


<line>
I wish I had

brothers growing up.

</line>


<line>
Touch football on the weekends,

noogie parades on the reg.

</line>


<line>
Life as an only child

can get pretty lonely.

</line>


<line>
Daddy, do you want to meet

my imaginary friend?

</line>


<line>
Imaginary friends

are freeloaders

invented by communists

to rip-off welfare.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you do

something productive,

like bang your head

against the wall

until your brain

isn't so stupid?

</line>


<line>
Okay, Daddy.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, I

was pretty lonely, too.

</line>


<line>
My family made

my life miserable,

and then they never

forgave me for leaving.

</line>


<line>
So, what,

you're like the black sheep?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Gary</name>'s the black sheep.

He's adopted.

</line>


<line>
I'm just the member of

the family nobody likes.

</line>


<line>
And my dad

was the worst of them all.

</line>


<line>
You told me

that you and your father

used to sit on the roof

and look at the stars together.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, I was just trying

to get you to open up,

so I used an old writer's trick

called "me lying to you."

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah?

Well, I'm using an old me trick

called

"that hurts my feelings."

</line>


<line>
And the truth is,

I used to sit alone

on the hill out by the dump

and dream of waking up

as <name type="PERSON">Chelsea Clinton</name>,

but with my hair.

</line>


<line>
You do have great hair.

</line>


<line>
I know.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[distant sirens]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

for a quick hi and bye.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Ten minutes, swear to <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>

with this kaleidoscope

</line>


<line>
I got you at the airport.

</line>


<line>

<line>
Look, I'm just here

to offer my condolences.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure, in and out,

like a Christmas.

</line>


<line>
Why would you want

to stick around,

be with your family

in their time of need?

Come on, Ma.

</line>


<line>
Don't fight

while the game's on.

For five years

she didn't come home.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you make like A-Rod

and blow.

</line>


<line>
Well, this was clearly

a huge mistake.

</line>


<line>
Ah, don't go.

</line>


<line>
Deedee, please.

</line>


<line>
Why not?

Ma doesn't want me here.

</line>


<line>
Ma don't know

what she wants.

</line>


<line>
She wants you here.

We all do.

</line>


<line>
Ain't that right, <name type="PERSON">Marty</name>?

</line>


<line>
Can't look up from the game.

<line>

- Oh, no way--

- What?

</line>


<line>
A TV star!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name> house.

</line>


<line>
Seventy-five each.

Children and seniors free.

</line>


<line>
Please stay

behind the ropes

and keep your hands and

belongings on your person

at all times.

</line>


<line>
Next we'll head to the kitchen

where-- Is that <name type="PERSON">Mila</name> Kunis?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Ooh!

</line>


<line>
Note the letters B.H.

on all hand towels and linens.

</line>


<line>
That stands for

"<name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name> <name type="ORG">House</name>."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutters clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, do you

pick up bodies?

</line>


<line>
Is that a service you provide?

Corpse removal?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you ever meet

any <name type="GPE">Boston</name> celebrities?

</line>


<line>
Well, one time

at <name type="ORG">Bristol Farms</name>,

</line>


<line>
Ben <name type="PERSON">Affleck</name> and I did reach

for the same bunch of grapes.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he eats grapes

just like us?

</line>


<line>
Hey, Ma,

Ben <name type="PERSON">Affleck</name> eats grapes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ma]</nonVerbComm> He don't eat grapes!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> said

he fed <name type="PERSON">Affleck</name> grapes.

</line>


<line>
He was graping it up

with the Daredevil himself.

</line>


<line>
This is the greatest day

of my life.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, I don't suppose you boys

would have any interest

in maybe playing some

touch football later?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
Touch football

with a star like you?

</line>


<line>
That would be

mad wicked pisser.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, you know what else

we got to do?

</line>


<line>
We got to watch

the Cryane video.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, that sounds good.

What's that?

</line>


<line>
No, we don't need

to revisit that.

</line>


<line>
When Deedee was 16,

we made up a secret pen pal

for her named <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>.

</line>


<line>
Guys, I really would rather

not discuss it.

</line>


<line>
We all took turns

writing her letters,

pretending to be this sensitive

boy from <name type="GPE">Cambridge</name>.

</line>


<line>
It was wicked messed up.

</line>


<line>
"Oh, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, we're

two misunderstood souls.

</line>


<line>
Everyone else is a phony.

</line>


<line>
Yours forever, <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>."

</line>


<line>
What?

That is amazing.

</line>


<line>
After six months of letters,

we hired a homeless guy

to pretend to be <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>

and take her

to the homecoming dance.

</line>


<line>
- Look at her.

- Watch, watch this part.

</line>


<line>
I like your boutonnière.

[laughter]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cries]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Why don't we watch this

every day?

</line>


<line>
- Look at her face.

- Now that's a good prank.

</line>


<line>
I was humiliated.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

</line>


<line>
It's a brothers thing,

right, brothers?

</line>


<line>
Whoo!

That's Cryane for you.

</line>


<line>
What a pussy.

</line>


<line>
You know,

it's nice that years later

we can all laugh about this.

</line>


<line>
Yep, my therapist

thinks the same thing.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go meet

with the funeral director.

</line>


<line>
Any of you boys

want to come?

</line>


<line>
Nah, I ain't so big

on funeral homes, Deedee.

</line>


<line>
All them dead bodies,

they give me the jeebies.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Deedee,

why do we got to go?

</line>


<line>
Fine, none of you

have to go.

</line>


<line>
I'll take care of everything.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

We all really appreciate it.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Why you got to take

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> with you?

</line>


<line>
- Boo!

- [bleats]

</line>


<line>
Boo!

</line>


<line>
Boys, you have

stolen my heart

like <name type="PERSON">Dave Roberts</name>

stole second base.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Hey!

He knows our things!

</line>


<line>
I must go now, but I'll see

you all at the funeral, okay?

</line>


<line>
And when I do,

you're all getting noogies.

</line>


<line>
- Funeral!

- Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Whoo-hoo!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Funeral!

</line>


<line>
Funeral! Funeral!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
And now,

a very special treat

just for

our platinum members.

</line>


<line>
Let's take a peek

at the slumbering

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name> himself.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Get out of my room, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm <name type="PERSON">David</name> <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Ohh!

</line>


<line>
And thus concludes our tour.

</line>


<line>
Have a Boreanderful day.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[somber organ music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Tell me about your father.

</line>


<line>
Well, he was a mean,

sadistic alcoholic,

who never supported

anything I did

and actively delighted

in seeing me fail.

</line>


<line>
Hmm, I see.

</line>


<line>
Sounds like you're looking for

our Piece of Shit <name type="PERSON">Dad</name> Package.

</line>


<line>
That would be too good

for my father.

</line>


<line>
Hmm, I see.

</line>


<line>
Might I then suggest

our Piece of Shit <name type="PERSON">Dad</name> Package

</line>


<line>
Would Be Too Good

For Him Package.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's the one.

</line>


<line>
Excellent choice.

</line>


<line>
Hey, can I suggest

something?

</line>


<line>
You might want to loosen up

a little.

</line>


<line>
I think you could actually

learn a thing or two

from your brothers.

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
If I was like my brothers,

nothing would ever get done.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying,

if you can't find a way

to let off some steam

you're going to explode.

[phone rings]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name> damn it!

Are you god damn kidding me?

</line>


<line>
I keep getting calls

from this unlisted number.

</line>


<line>
Ignore.

Who are these assholes?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you just answer,

and then you'll know?

</line>


<line>
Oh, they'd just love that,

wouldn't they?

</line>


<line>
Ugh, how are we supposed

to blackmail him

if we can't reach him?

</line>


<line>
Maybe we got to get him

where he lives?

</line>


<line>
You mean--?

</line>


<line>
That's right,

his house.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horns honking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What the--</ital>

<ital>Whose house is this?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Is that <name type="PERSON">David</name> <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name>?

</line>


<line>
I could've sworn

<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name> lived here.

</line>


<line>
Hey, let's keep

these lines moving, huh?

</line>


<line>
You want to stop and chat,

you gotta pay for

the extended stay ticket.

</line>


<line>
Ah, so much,

so much, so much.

</line>


<line>
Another five Gs, T-Bag,

and we are in the pink.

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
I ran out of shoeboxes

for the money,

and the books

aren't adding up.

</line>


<line>
Plus the men's lav

needs to be serviced,

and I had to fire Janine

in the gift shop

for stealing <name type="PERSON">Boreabble</name> heads.

</line>


<line>
I mean, how did I end up

with all this responsibility?

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm not screwing around

here, small fry.

</line>


<line>
You better make

those numbers sing.

</line>


<line>
I don't think these

offshore banks we've been using

are 100% legal.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, my mother told me

never to slap an idiot.

</line>


<line>
What?

Ow!

</line>


<line>
Now we're both

breaking the rules.

</line>


<line>
You listen,

and you listen good.

</line>


<line>
I've gotten used

to a certain lifestyle

since <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name> <name type="ORG">House</name>

went public,

and I'm not going back

to the old way.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mommy</name> likes her shoes, see?

</line>


<line>
And her pearls.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm in too deep.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to do.

</line>


<line>
<ital>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] I'll tell you</ital>

<ital>what you should do.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Who said that?

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's me, <name type="PERSON">David</name> <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Is that what

<name type="PERSON">David</name> <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name> sounds like?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Uh, sure.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Let me give you some advice.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>As we say on my show--</ital>

I want to say, <ital>New Girl</ital>?--

</line>


<line>
<ital>just keep doing what you're</ital>

<ital>doing, and you'll be fine.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wow, thanks, <name type="PERSON">Davie</name> B.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Never call me that.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
It's 4:00.

I don't think anyone's coming.

</line>


<line>
Unbe-goddamn-lievable.

</line>


<line>
All those jerk wads

had to do was show up,

and they couldn't

even do that.

</line>


<line>
Where's the body even?

</line>


<line>
Beg your pardon,

minor hiccup.

</line>


<line>
My goons went to pick your

father up, but nobody was home.

</line>


<line>
For a nominal fee,

we can scrounge up

another body for you.

</line>


<line>
Would you care to peruse

our loaner closet?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[upbeat music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, assholes!

Where were you?

</line>


<line>
I planned the whole funeral,

like you asked me to,

and nobody showed.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, we realized dad

wouldn't have wanted

some stuffy funeral.

</line>


<line>
He would've wanted his body

to be chopped up into chum

and thrown

in <name type="PERSON">Derek</name> Jeter's fat face.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

</line>


<line>
Wait, what?

Where is <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>?

</line>


<line>
We got him chummed.

He's in the truck.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horn honks]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You chummed <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>?

</line>


<line>
It's what your father wanted,

honey,

but then you wouldn't know

anything about that, would you?

</line>


<line>
Let me get this straight.

</line>


<line>
So instead of coming

to the funeral

that I paid for

and spent all day organizing,

you had <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s body

ground into chum,

so you could throw his mushy

remains on <name type="PERSON">Derek</name> Jeter?

</line>


<line>
No, not just on <name type="PERSON">Derek</name> Jeter.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna throw it

into his fat face.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, his fat face.

- In his fat face.

</line>


<line>
The Yankees are in town

this week.

</line>


<line>
The planets are aligning,

Deedee.

</line>


<line>
Tommy, you begged me

to stay and help.

</line>


<line>
Why does everything always

got to be about big-shot <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

</line>


<line>
Too good for her home.

</line>


<line>
I don't think

I'm too good for my home.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, guys,

you got it all wrong.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> isn't a big-shot.

She's my ghostwriter.

</line>


<line>
She's writing a book that's not

even gonna have her name on it.

</line>


<line>
You think this

is how she expected

her life would be going at 34?

</line>


<line>
She lives with her rich

boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

</line>


<line>
She's not too good

for anything.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>'s a freeloader?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Here comes Cryane.

</line>


<line>
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, you are making

a public spectacle of yourself.

</line>


<line>
Deedee, what are you doing

with <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s keys?

</line>


<line>
Put those back.

</line>


<line>
Oh, come on,

that's <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s truck.

</line>


<line>
- [screams]

- <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>'s chum is in the back.

</line>


<line>
No!

No, no, no!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> Suck a dick, dumb shits!

</line>


<line>
Well, that crazy clam did it.

She took Pops.

</line>

<ital>[announcer] And it's a one-hopper</ital>

<ital>Easy out at first.</ital>

</line>

is nothing?

</line>


<line>
Sox are on,

and I haven't seen this one.

</line>


<line>
Does anyone know

where she might have gone?

</line>


<line>
Ah, she used to run off

like this all the time

in high school, too.

</line>


<line>
Who knows where crazy goes?

</line>


<line>
I think I know

where she went.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you can't leave.

</line>


<line>
The party's

just getting started.

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> was pretty upset,

and she's got your dad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, don't go, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
You're like the fifth brother

I never had.

</line>


<line>
I-- Really?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, don't leave, bro.

</line>


<line>
After this,

we'll go play touch football

and do a noogie parade.

</line>


<line>
Ah, um...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sirens blaring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What are we gonna do?

</line>


<line>
What do you mean, we?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn

always lands on her feet.

</line>


<line>
Ha!

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Boreanaz</name>, I presume.

</line>


<line>
Um, would you

like a <name type="PERSON">Boreabble</name> head?

</line>


<line>
The amazing thing is,

the house looks

just like <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s house.

</line>


<line>
They must have

the same architect.

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

how are things with you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Not good.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I should've known

it was a waste of time

to come back here.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's awful.

</line>


<line>
Well, when you get back,

</line>


<line>
I'll give you one of

my patented Peanutbutter hugs.

</line>


<line>
Crunchy and creamy.

</line>


<line>
You know

that patent wasn't approved,

but I'll take it.

</line>


<line>
I have to go.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s here.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, well,</ital>

<ital>what's he doing--?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, sorry I said

all that stuff about you.

</line>


<line>
It's all true, isn't it?

</line>


<line>
I found this letter

back at the bar.

</line>


<line>
I think it's for you.

</line>


<line>
Look, just read it.

I think you'll like it.

</line>


<line>
"Dear <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, it's me,

your old pen pal <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>.

</line>


<line>
This definitely isn't

<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name> writing this."

</line>


<line>
Keep reading.

</line>


<line>
"You're a good person,

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

and that's

the most important thing.

</line>


<line>
Even if no one

appreciates you,

it's important that

you don't stop being good.

</line>


<line>
I like how you always

bring your own bags

to the grocery store,

and how you're always

organized to go places.

</line>


<line>
I like how you chew gum on the

airplane so your ears will pop.

</line>


<line>
A lot of people might not

appreciate that about you,

but I do.

</line>


<line>
Yours forever, <name type="PERSON">Leo</name>."

</line>


<line>
That's the best letter

he ever wrote me.

</line>


<line>
Look, take it from someone

with his own shitty parents,

family is a sinkhole,

and you were right to get out

when you had the chance.

</line>


<line>
The stupid thing is,

even now I still just want them

to be proud of me

and think I did good.

</line>


<line>
Is that really stupid?

</line>


<line>
- Yep.

- No, it isn't.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it is.

</line>


<line>
You want those guys

to be proud of you?

</line>


<line>
I guess I was just hoping to

get some modicum of closure.

</line>


<line>
Closure is a made up thing

by Steven Spielberg

to sell movie tickets.

</line>


<line>
It, like true love

and the Munich Olympics,

doesn't exist

in the real world.

</line>


<line>
The only thing to do now

is just to keep living forward.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but every time

I come back here they--

</line>


<line>
So don't come back here.

</line>


<line>
What's great about <name type="GPE">Los</name> Angeles

is nobody cares about where

you're from or who you are.

</line>


<line>
It's a superficial town

where you can worry

about stupid shit

like keeping your pool clean,

and what artisanal nuts

to put on your salad.

</line>


<line>
I do like salad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's the best.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think people keep

moving there?

</line>


<line>
Thanks, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
The good news is, your dad

can't hurt anyone ever again.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh.
