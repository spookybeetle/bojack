<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Hello?

</line>


<line>
How the hell do they expect me to learn

five pages of dialogue in one day?

</line>


<line>
-What am I, <name type="PERSON">Yo</name><name type="ORG">un</name>g Sheldon?

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>--

</line>


<line>
No s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have that much talking.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>V is a visual medium.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Anyway, where the hell are you?</ital>

-<name type="PERSON">Ed</name>en, North <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>ina.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, North <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>ina?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond worst of the <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>inas.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know I'm from here, right?

-Yeah, and you got out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what "from" means?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to be there anymore.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why they call it "from."

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm about to be

<ital>from </ital>this conversation.

</line>


<line>
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

Can we just talk about Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter?

</line>


<line>
Why did you cast him on this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

Everybody loves him.

</line>


<line>
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.

I'm <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-So then I got a food truck for the crew

with a big sign that said,

"From your favorite star,"

but everybody t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

it was from Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey didn't even read the sign.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be back tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Do you think you can handle your shit

<name type="ORG">un</name>til then?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, that so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like me.

What are you doing there anyway?

</line>


<line>
Just... taking care of some family stuff.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[series theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for coming, all this way.

</line>


<line>
-We could've just talked on the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne.

-I wanted to meet you in person.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn difference.

</line>


<line>
Ooh! I've never met a person w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> had

a difference named after them before.

</line>


<line>
Well, this is important.

We're here to talk about your baby.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're thinking;

another dumb teenager,

so liquored up, she forgot to make sure

her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's all true,

but I'm not some backwoods hick.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-I'm 18, I got my w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life ahead of me,

</line>


<line>
and it's not like my boyfriend's begging

me to marry him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>yfriends rarely do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>s name's <name type="GPE">Strib</name>, s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt for <name type="PERSON">Dennis</name>.

-Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
He's not exactly the romantic type,

but he's got t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se eyes

you just can't say no to, you know?

</line>


<line>
I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe you and <name type="GPE">Strib</name> have

many happy child-free years, together.

</line>


<line>
I'm willing to do whatever I can

to help contribute to the child-free part.

</line>


<line>
-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>.

-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne buzzing, meowing]

</line>


<line>
Oh, sorry. It's work.

</line>


<line>
Everyone I work with is such a baby.

</line>


<line>
And I love babies!

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Hello, baby.

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen, I know <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>

just wants me to be "the woman",

</line>


<line>
and keep my mouth shut,

but this s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w makes no sense.

</line>


<line>
In the rooftop motorcycle scene,

<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name> and <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> keep saying,

</line>


<line>
<ital>"<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is so dangerous."</ital>

<ital>"Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."</ital>

</line>


<line>
But then they just get off

the motorcycles.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't they skidding

towards the side of the building,

</line>


<line>
and then they roll off just as their bikes

go careening over the edge?

</line>


<line>
Okay, sure, pitch it to <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>.

</line>


<line>
Everything I pitch, he s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ots down.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just because it's coming

from someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> isn't him.

</line>


<line>
If you want him to like your idea,

just convince him

he t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught of it, himself.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u really think he'll do it

because I say it's his idea?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a great idea, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thanks! I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do it.

</line>


<line>
-So sorry.

-No problem.

</line>


<line>
Um, just so you know, I have met with

some other candidates, mostly couples.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't believe I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d someone

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> grew up in <name type="PERSON">Ed</name>en.

</line>


<line>
-When's the last time you were here?

-Oh, not since my mother died.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I'm sorry.

-It was a long time ago.

</line>


<line>
-She's still dead, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is true.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sipping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Sorry we had to meet at <name type="ORG">Phuzzy</name>'s.

-I love <name type="ORG">Phuzzy</name>'s.

</line>


<line>
I bet you got fancy restaurants

in <name type="GPE">LA</name>, huh?

</line>


<line>
Probably a <name type="GPE">California</name> Pizza Kitchen

on every corner.

</line>


<line>
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"

since you're in <name type="GPE">California</name>?

</line>


<line>
No, we call it "<name type="GPE">California</name> Pizza Kitchen,"

or "CPK."

</line>


<line>
CPK? What kind of city person's too busy

to say "<name type="GPE">California</name> Pizza Kitchen"?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta catch a bus or something?

Stay a while and say the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le name.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.

</line>


<line>
I live in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>s Angeles now,

but you know what they say,

you can take the girl

out of the <name type="GPE">Greensboro</name><name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>gh Point

metropolitan area, but you can't take

the <name type="GPE">Greensboro</name><name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>gh Point

metropolitan area out of the girl.

</line>


<line>
I wish my boyfriend would've taken

his penis out of the girl.

</line>


<line>
-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.

-Yeah, no, I got it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, have I missed this!

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> eat the shit

out of these hush puppies,

and then tomorrow,

I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,

meaning a sausage patty,

not that bullshit link situation

they call "sausage" in <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both laughing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<line>
Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.

I'll be right back.

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn!

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to tell you what a ball

I'm having on this crazy cop s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Glad to hear it.

</line>


<line>
And my favorite star paid

for a food truck.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why <name type="PERSON">Pete</name>r Scolari is buying

me a falafel plate,

but, hey, I'm not complaining.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you have a question?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
So, I know my ex-wife is

in the writers' room.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to make things weird for her

or anybody else, so...

do I have to do all the dialogue,

as scripted,

or can I have a little f<name type="ORG">un</name> with it?

</line>


<line>
-Um--

<ital>-Normally, I wouldn't even ask,</ital>

but because of the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le<ital> ex-wife</ital>

of it all,

</line>


<line>
I figured I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld just double-check

that it's definitely okay

if I change every single word.

</line>


<line>
Knowing <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>,

I would just stick to the script.

</line>


<line>
So, don't flip the script?

</line>


<line>
-Exactly. Don't flip <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>'s script.

-<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a double-flip.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, you're saying I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld flip it?

</line>


<line>
I'm saying the exact opposite.

</line>


<line>
-So, flip it. <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> it good.

-Okay, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're very f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny and talented.

<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye. Sorry. S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w folk.

</line>


<line>
Well, this was a pleasure.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for coming all this way.

</line>


<line>
I do <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe to make a decision soon.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you have to leave already?

-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur booth?

-At the flea market.

</line>


<line>
I sell clothes I bought cheap

and then bedazzled.

</line>


<line>
I'm not saying I'm the Danville <name type="PERSON">T</name>arget

or nothing,

but it's good enough for fleas.

</line>


<line>
Okay, call me if you have

any other questions.

</line>


<line>
I always answer my p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne,

day or night.

<line>
My mom, well, obviously she was planning

on cleaning the floors,

but I asked her if I could do it.

</line>


<line>
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,

so one day,

</line>


<line>
I can be as good a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>usekeeper

as she is.

</line>


<line>
Why do you still live here?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you go live with your dad

down in Raleigh?

</line>


<line>
All my sisters and brothers are gone.

</line>


<line>
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.

</line>


<line>
Besides, if I go,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s going to keep you out of trouble?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you know I'm on the football team?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I do know it.

Are you ever <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> play?

</line>


<line>
Probably not, smart-ass.

</line>


<line>
Not <name type="ORG">un</name>less the first-string quarterback

gets hurt.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you

the first-string quarterback?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not even

first-string <name type="PERSON">ho</name>usekeeper!

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w about I first-string p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch you

in the nose?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Okay, easy, easy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, I think if I just keep my head down

and be patient,

</line>


<line>
Coach will eventually realize

I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be QB one, you know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a terrible approach.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to go after what <ital>you </ital>want.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta fly into that <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>,

like <name type="PERSON">Amelia</name> Earhart did.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, like in the movie.

</line>


<line>
I never knew anybody w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> liked old movies

as much as you do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're 18.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u never knew anybody, period.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
But what if I'm not as good a quarterback

as I think I am?

</line>


<line>
Doesn't matter.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't need to be good enough.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just need to convince your coach

you're good enough.

</line>


<line>
Damn! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what?

</line>


<line>
-I'll talk to him tomorrow.

-Don't leave <name type="ORG">un</name>til you get that yes.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I really want to spend more time

getting to know each other.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his baby, your baby,

means everything to me.

</line>


<line>
I think the more time we spend together,

</line>


<line>
-you'll realize I'm--

-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne meowing]

</line>


<line>
-Do you need to take that?

-No, it's fine. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he perfect candidate.

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you always answered your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne,

day or night.

</line>


<line>
Right. Hello?

</line>


<line>
I just got off the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne with <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>.

</line>


<line>
He's really excited about

this new motorcycle st<name type="ORG">un</name>t he came up with.

</line>


<line>
-He wants to do it tomorrow, but--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>, full of ideas. Gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Well, the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w is already way over budget

and my boss is starting to ask questions.

</line>


<line>
Now, normally, I love questions

because they're good for pondering,

</line>


<line>
<ital>but I guess in the corporate world,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>when people ask questions,</ital>

<ital>they expect someone to answer them.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And, apparently,

"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"

is not the kind of answer

they're looking for.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Wait, one more thing.</ital>

-What?

</line>


<line>
Do you think <name type="LOC">Lake</name> Erie ever gets jealous

of <name type="LOC">Lake</name> <name type="PERSON">Sup</name>erior?

</line>


<line>
Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?

</line>


<line>
We've been through this, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

<name type="LOC">Lake</name>s don't have emotions.

</line>


<line>
What about <name type="PERSON">Rick</name>i <name type="LOC">Lake</name>?

</line>


<line>
As I was saying, I'd love to spend

more time together, if you're up for it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u mentioned the flea market.

I'd love to check it out.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.

-I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught it was today.

</line>


<line>
No, no. I just have to prep for it today.

</line>


<line>
But if you can stay another day,

that would be awesome.

</line>


<line>
But only if you can. I know you're busy.

</line>


<line>
I don't want me, or my baby,

to get in the way of your career.

<line>
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's got a number.

Some are winners, some aren't.

</line>


<line>
It all depends

where the little white ball lands.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he problem is when people

with losing numbers think they're winners.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen what the hell are these?

-College brochures. I--

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think you're going

to some fancy college in <name type="GPE">California</name>,

all the way on the other side

<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> abandon me?

-<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m, it's not about you.

</line>


<line>
UC<name type="GPE">LA</name>?

No, you will not see <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
Even if you get into one of these places,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w're you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> pay for it?

</line>


<line>
I'll get a job or a paid internship.

</line>


<line>
Well, la-di-da, I did not realize

I was in the presence of someone,

</line>


<line>
-w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get a paid internship.

-<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m, you need to go to bed.

between you and me, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

</line>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is my bed.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Where are you?</ital>

-Something came up.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, listen, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter's

doing all his own st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts,

and every time he does

a dumb little somersault,

everybody goes nuts

like he's goddamn <name type="PERSON">Kerri Strug</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kerri Strug</name>?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta update your references.

</line>


<line>
When the world sees

the likes of <name type="PERSON">Kerri Strug</name>, a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

</line>


<line>
I will adjust accordingly.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Anyway, I said I wanted to do</ital>

<ital>my own st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts, too,</ital>

but little did I know

that <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> was writing a new scene,

where a motorcycle falls off

a five-story building.

</line>


<line>
Just say you don't want to do it.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I cannot do that</ital>

<ital>because I already fired my st<name type="ORG">un</name>t double,</ital>

so I also need you to call him

and get him back,

and that might be tricky,

'cause I was really brutal about it.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-Because people were watching.

</line>


<line>
Now I need you to intervene

and forbid me from doing my own st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts,

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh I want to,

because I actually don't want to,

because that would require me to be

in good shape, which we know I'm not,

and also not a coward,

which we both know I am.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>--

-<ital>Also, if you could say</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>it's because I'm too important a star</ital>

<ital>to take the risk on,</ital>

but Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter can keep doing

his st<name type="ORG">un</name>ts

because he is less important;

that would be real cool, thanks.

</line>


<line>
Fine, I'll handle it!

</line>


<line>
Just stop whining like a little bitch!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

that they're not being sold to.

</line>


<line>
Wow!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's pretty manipulative.

</line>


<line>

because your clothing sells itself.
