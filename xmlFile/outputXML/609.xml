Acting is about leaving everything behind,

and... [clicks tongue, sighs]

</line>


<line>
And becoming something completely new.

</line>


<line>
What is acting? Anyone?

</line>


<line>
Acting is about

leaving everything behind, and...

becoming something completely new.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm> Hey-o!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles nervously]</nonVerbComm> Oh...

</line>


<line>
What is acting?

</line>


<line>
Anyone?

Anyone?

</line>

Acting is about leaving everything behind

</line>

Nailed it.

<line>
Good morning,

my name is Professor <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

</line>


<line>
which will remain

on that whiteboard forever,

</line>


<line>
and this is Intermediate Scene Study.

</line>


<line>
What is acting? Anyone?

</line>


<line>
-[all] Ooh!

-Oh! Okay. You.

</line>


<line>
According to <name type="NORP">Stanislothski</name>,

</line>


<line>
acting is the desire

to create inside of oneself

</line>


<line>
another, deeper, more interesting life

</line>


<line>
than the one

that actually surro<name type="ORG">un</name>ds him...

or her.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?

-[girl] Oh!

</line>


<line>
Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving

truthfully <name type="ORG">un</name>der imaginary circumstances."

</line>


<line>
Acting is behaving truthfully

<name type="ORG">un</name>der imaginary circumstances.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.

But what is--?

</line>


<line>
Guys, I'm concerned this class

is getting very theory-qua-theory...

</line>


<line>
 I was about to say that.

</line>


<line>
...when technique should be a means

toward a more engaging art.

</line>


<line>
-Well, quite astute.

-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
Acting is the, um... [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
Acting is...

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I don't know what acting is.

I don't know what I'm doing.

</line>


<line>
I shouldn't be here.

</line>


<line>
-[boy] Wow.

-[girl] Oh!

</line>


<line>
No, I don't want to quit.

I'm acting! That's acting.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
Class dismissed.

</line>


<line>
But we still have

an hour and 20 minutes left.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Again, I was acting.

</line>


<line>
You so<name type="ORG">un</name>ded serious.

</line>


<line>
Instead of judging my acting,

how about you act and I judge you?

</line>


<line>
-For real?

-Yeah. Good point.

</line>


<line>
We could show you the scenes

we were working on last semester.

</line>


<line>
Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."

-Whenever you're ready.

</line>


<line>
Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II

grenade with the pin still in it?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[in <name type="NORP">British</name> accent]</nonVerbComm> Why would you want

an old thing like that?

</line>


<line>
Tonight, I intend to explode myself.

Where are the extra towels?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-Does this play take place in <name type="GPE">England</name>?

-[normal voice] No.

</line>


<line>
So why are you talking

with an English accent?

</line>


<line>
I'm acting.

</line>


<line>
Just as an exercise,

maybe use your normal voice.

</line>


<line>
And Tawnie, when you're telling

your mother you're gonna kill yourself,

the next line is,

"Where are the extra towels," right?

</line>


<line>
And the character's being very casual,

</line>


<line>
so maybe she should also be casual

when she says she's gonna kill herself.

</line>


<line>
Like it's a big deal,

but it's not a big deal for her.

</line>


<line>
-Like that's the irony of the scene.

-Whoa! That's really smart.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's see it again.

</line>


<line>
So, darling, what f<name type="ORG">un</name> and games

shall we play?

</line>


<line>
Shall we play Scattergories?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[raspy voice]</nonVerbComm> I detest Scattergories!

</line>


<line>
Whatever the prompt,

you always answer in vague allusions

to the baby we never had!

</line>


<line>
Stop. You're both talking to the audience.

</line>


<line>
I want you to talk to each other,

you're having a conversation.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Who's you?

-Who's me? Screw you is who's me!

</line>


<line>
I got the leads.

The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.

</line>


<line>
Mm! Them's them good leads.

</line>


<line>
-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!

-Okay, here's my question for you.

</line>


<line>
Does your character

know he's horny for leads,

or is he discovering it?

</line>


<line>
Who's next? Great. What's the scene?

</line>


<line>
The scene is I'm late for my next class.

</line>


<line>
We were supposed to get out

20 minutes ago.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday.

</line>


<line>
Great work today. Way to go, team.

</line>


<line>
We did it. That was great, huh?

How good was I?

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[door closes]

</line>


<line>
Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.

How do you think this is going?

</line>


<line>
-I think I'm crushing it.

-Wow, okay. Well, I admire the confidence.

</line>


<line>
I know you're an acting major.

</line>


<line>
And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure

that you're taking other classes.

</line>


<line>
Like, Economics,

or maybe a plumbing course.

</line>


<line>
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.

</line>


<line>
What would you want to do

if the acting thing doesn't work out?

</line>


<line>
Hold up, do you think

I'm not a good actor?

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
You said "Not a good actor."

But now that you've said it...

</line>


<line>
Some would say there are no bad actors,

only bad teachers.

</line>


<line>
What about Jason Segel?

He was a bad actor in <ital>Bad Teacher.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I am a wonderful actor.

</line>


<line>
You'll see.

</line>


<line>
-[door closes]

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
She knew I was dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k,

but she still let me drive off

with Jonathan.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, oh! I'm a dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k!

</line>


<line>
Jesus, I had no idea, I--

</line>


<line>
Booze has taken everything from me.

</line>


<line>
-My job as an airline pilot, my wife.

-Huh? What the--?

</line>


<line>
Those two things.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Okay. I see what's happening.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, everybody.

This is one of my acting students.

</line>


<line>
-He's trying to, um--

-Who's Whitfield?

</line>


<line>
-Nobody said "Whitfield."

-My name is Whip Whitaker.

</line>


<line>
-Did you follow me here?

-I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

</line>


<line>
Drove the plane upside-downsy.

Yeah, I'm dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k now.

</line>


<line>
-Wow.

-No, don't--

</line>


<line>
We've all been there, man.

</line>


<line>
He hasn't been there.

That's the plot of the movie <ital>Flight.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Glug</name>, <name type="ORG">glug</name>, <name type="ORG">glug</name>.

</line>


<line>
-That wet the ol' whistle.

-So sorry, everyone.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent

blood alcohol level.

</line>


<line>
-I'm in trouble. I am wasted.

-This is very disrespectful.

</line>


<line>
-Hammered...

-We work hard to create a safe space here.

</line>


<line>
-...tanked, blitzed...

-So sorry about that. I recognize that.

</line>


<line>
-...<name type="NORP">Irish</name>, canned, smashed...

-I value this room, just know that.

</line>


<line>
-...annihilated, laced, faded.

-Really sorry about all of this.

</line>


<line>
-So sorry.

-In conclusion, I am a dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

</line>


<line>
The big D.

</line>


<line>
-Fine. Shut up. You're a dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

-Aha! Wrong, I was acting!

</line>


<line>
It appears the student

has become the student-er.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wow, an actor.

</line>


<line>
-Uh... [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

-[crowd cheering]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both gr<name type="ORG">un</name>t]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Foul! That fowl fouled, ref!

Where's the whistle?

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-There are women tossing women everywhere!

</line>


<line>
What is this, the R<name type="ORG">un</name>ning of the Brides

at Filene's Basement?

</line>


<line>
Who's with me?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.

-What? Really?

</line>


<line>
Also, nobody knows

what Filene's Basement is.

</line>


<line>
That's a shame. You definitely paid

too much for that coat.

</line>


<line>
-[whistle trills]

-Oh, is it over? Did we win?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm> Hey, you're really good.

I think.

</line>


<line>
Don't feel like you have to come

to these things if it's not your thing.

</line>


<line>
No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying you have your things

and I have my things. It's okay.

</line>


<line>
-You wanna get something to eat?

-I-I can't.

</line>


<line>
When we win,

we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.

</line>


<line>
-So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds f<name type="ORG">un</name>. Can I join you?

-I don't think you should.

</line>


<line>
It's a bar,

and there will be alcohol there.

</line>


<line>
-That's okay.

-And yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g girls.

</line>


<line>
-What's that have to do with anything?

-Nothing. Just stating a fact.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you.

-Wouldn't wanna be you!

</line>


<line>
But I would. You're cool.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Tawnie,

you're <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>'s best friend...

</line>


<line>
-We're actually in a fight right now.

-Again?

</line>


<line>
Our fights are like Adele songs.

</line>


<line>
All kind of the same one,

but with different specifics.

</line>


<line>
-Well, do you <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand this rugby thing?

-Uh, honestly? No.

</line>


<line>
She came back from winter break

super aggro, but that's <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
Suddenly, she decides,

"This is what I'm all about now,

and everyone else

just has to get on board."

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do with that?

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-I guess... get on board.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whistle trills]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice.

</line>


<line>
Nice r<name type="ORG">un</name>! Very nice!

</line>


<line>
Touchdown! That's my sister!

</line>


<line>
Good try!

</line>


<line>
Try? She did it. She scored.

</line>


<line>
It's called a try.

</line>


<line>
Try to keep up.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Hey!

-[sighing]

</line>


<line>
-Yeah!

-Yes, Cardinals!

</line>


<line>
-All right!

-All right!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both gr<name type="ORG">un</name>t]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
The two teams applaud each other,

and then the referees.

</line>


<line>
As is customary. See footnote.

</line>


<line>
We know.

</line>


<line>
What's up, rugger?

</line>


<line>
Two tries, two conversions,

and a drop goal?

</line>


<line>
Jonah Lomu over here.

</line>


<line>
-Great game, Hock.

-Oh, Hock.

</line>


<line>
I like it.

Can I get a nickname too, Regina?

</line>


<line>
How about, "Professor <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

adult faculty member"?

</line>


<line>
-We have to go.

-Yeah, go.

</line>


<line>
Go. See you.

See you on the scrumming pitch.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whistle trills]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
W-E-S-leyan!

</line>


<line>
We will rock and maul and win!

</line>


<line>
Wait. Where's <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>?

</line>


<line>
You mean <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>

<name type="GPE">Manheim</name>-<name type="GPE">Mannheim</name>-Guerrero...

</line>


<line>
Hey. What the hell? You quit rugby?

</line>


<line>
God. You so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like three of my dads.

</line>


<line>
-The other five were relieved.

-You were good.

</line>


<line>
I need to focus on my studies.

I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but rugby's our thing.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, then I guess we'll just--

We'll find a new thing.

</line>


<line>
How about my thing is reading

<ital>Gender Trouble </ital>by Judith Butler,

and your thing is being a teacher?

</line>


<line>
Are you okay?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I'm just busy with school stuff.

</line>


<line>
You got your showcase in a couple weeks?

</line>


<line>
"An Evening of Modern <name type="GPE">America</name>n Scenes"?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I'll-- I'll go to that.

</line>


<line>
-Great. I'll see you then.

-Yeah, see you then.

</line>


<line>
Not if I see you first--!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone ringing, beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Hey, listen.

</line>


<line>
-It's your very good acco<name type="ORG">un</name>tant, Gaz.

-Hey, Gaz.

</line>


<line>
I just noticed you spent

a lot of money last year.

</line>


<line>
-Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot?

-You just noticed that?

</line>


<line>
I've got a ton of clients, okay?

And this was a big cocaine year for me.

</line>


<line>
But we're fine. Just make another movie,

and you'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
-You're working on a movie?

<ital>-No.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Actually, I'm a college professor now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sputters]</nonVerbComm> What, do you hate money?

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Gaz...</ital>

-Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.

</line>


<line>
Basically, we're fine.

As I told my wife before she left me,

</line>


<line>
I'm not worried,

and you shouldn't be either.

</line>


<line>
We may need to <name type="ORG">un</name>load some assets, though.

</line>


<line>
-You still own that restaurant?

-Elefante?

</line>


<line>
I'd love to dump that money pit,

but what idiot would buy it?

</line>


<line>
-Sold! On this arrangement.

-Of course you're sold. It was your idea.

</line>


<line>
Explain it to me one more time?

</line>


<line>
Okay. You'll spend a lot of time

with international superstar

sex symbol, Joey <name type="ORG">Pogo</name>,

building a close emotional bond.

</line>


<line>
After you've established that connection,

you'll share one magical evening

of intimate sexual <name type="ORG">congress</name>,

after which, we'll finally be even.

</line>


<line>
You'll marry me, and the two of you

will never see each other again.

</line>


<line>
-Well, I guess it's worth a try.

-<ital><music>♪Who's that dog? ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<music>♪ Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> ♪</music></ital>

-Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello? No?

</line>


<line>
Really? Wow, hold on a <name type="ORG">sec</name>.

</line>


<line>
Pickles, should I buy Elefante?

</line>


<line>
Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.

</line>


<line>
Like Ike and Tina Turn-- No.

</line>


<line>
-Well, I'm sure there are good examples.

-There must be.

</line>


<line>
But buying a restaurant's

a big commitment.

</line>


<line>
What if I went in on it with you?

I like food.

</line>


<line>
Great idea, Joey <name type="ORG">Pogo</name>. I'm in!

</line>


<line>
On you being in. On it. With me.

</line>


<line>
I've got big ideas for this place.

</line>


<line>
One word-- lazy <name type="NORP">Susans</name>.

</line>


<line>
Hold on.

</line>


<line>
Before we make any rash decisions,

should we maybe consider the long-term...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> Pickles, this guy on the phone

is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.

</line>


<line>
Sorry. Of course.

Finish your conversation.

</line>


<line>
-Sold!

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
-Now, you were saying?

-...ramifications.

</line>


<line>
Lazy <name type="NORP">Susans</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[raspy voice]</nonVerbComm> Oh, Heidi,

you'll never bag a man

with all your talk of feminism,

and your grandfather in <name type="GPE">Switzerland</name>,

and all your little goat friends--

</line>


<line>
Stop. Terry, this character is 28.

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think

a 28-year-old so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[normal voice]</nonVerbComm> I mean, yes?

</line>


<line>
You do the same old-man voice

for every character.

</line>


<line>
Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it

in the show business.

</line>


<line>
In "the show business,"

when they have old man characters,

they cast real old men.

</line>


<line>
-I'll show you.

-Please don't.

</line>


<line>
You'll see.

</line>


<line>
We still have 20 minutes of class left.

</line>


<line>
I'd driven across that bridge dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

h<name type="ORG">un</name>dreds of times, but never on black ice.

</line>


<line>
-[door opens]

-[Terry in raspy voice] Back in my day,

</line>


<line>
-we called that "the hidden slipperies."

-Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
But we didn't go to meetings

and talk about our problems.

</line>


<line>
-No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.

-Please leave. Now.

</line>


<line>
-Who's Terry?

-Nobody said Terry.

</line>


<line>
Mind if I sit a spell?

These old bones need a rest.

</line>


<line>
Sure, take it easy.

</line>


<line>
Everyone, this is another one

of my students.

</line>


<line>
I'm very sorry, I have no idea

why they think this is gonna impress me.

</line>


<line>
I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.

</line>


<line>
Terry...

</line>


<line>
Here I am, in the twilight of my years,

having dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k it all away.

</line>


<line>
-My job as an airline pilot...

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
-My son...

-You don't have a son.

</line>


<line>
Not anymore I don't,

because I abandoned him.

</line>


<line>
I abandoned my boy!

</line>


<line>
-[Whitfield] Papa?

-My boy!

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God.

-Papa? Is that you?

</line>


<line>
I've gone blind, me has,

from working in the distillery!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my sweet child!

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Todd, why don't you and Ruthie

go for a stroll

while I talk to these acting students?

</line>


<line>
She's just a baby, and I don't want

to expose her to too much desperation.

</line>


<line>
-You got it, boss.

-[Ruthie giggles]

<line>
Today, we have a very special guest.

</line>


<line>
This is my friend, Princess Carolyn,

who was nice enough to come here

to talk about the business of acting.

</line>


<line>
So, please do not embarrass me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
How many months

<name type="ORG">un</name>til people get discovered, usually?

</line>


<line>
One? Two? [gasps] Three?

</line>


<line>
This is more of a comment than a question,

but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.

</line>


<line>
What's the best diner to be discovered in

drinking a milkshake?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What if I want to do nudity?

Do I still have to sign a waiver?

</line>


<line>
Huh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[yawns]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whoo!

</line>


<line>
Hey, who's the kid

that didn't ask a question?

</line>


<line>
-The brooding kid in the back.

-Oh, that's Stan.

</line>


<line>
That kid's got it.

</line>


<line>
The look, the sauce,

the power to make me feel

like a 13-year-old girl,

and to make a 13-year-old girl

feel like a woman.

</line>


<line>
I wanna cast him.

</line>


<line>
-You haven't even seen him act.

-Is he good?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> He's the best actor I got.

</line>


<line>
I had my doubts

when he did the scene from <ital>Proof,</ital>

but when he did the scene from <ital>Doubt,</ital>

I thought, "There's the proof."

</line>


<line>
-I have to sign him.

-No.

</line>


<line>
Stan needs to finish school.

He's a sophomore.

</line>


<line>
Great! A legal adult but he looks yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g.

</line>


<line>
He can play all the roles that other

yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g, impressionable actors can't

because they keep ODing,

or going to prison, or going to rehab,

or killing themselves.

</line>


<line>
-No, he's not ready.

-Why don't we let Stan decide?

</line>


<line>
I want to be your manager.

</line>


<line>
And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy

on "Birthday Dad" right now.

</line>


<line>
Stan, <name type="GPE">LA</name>'s not going anywhere.

</line>


<line>
But you need an education,

something to keep you gro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded.

</line>


<line>
Stan, look at me.

You have an opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity now.

</line>


<line>
What do you need, a piece of paper?

You're done with this place.

</line>


<line>
Stan? Stan. Stan, Stan.

</line>


<line>
One day, you're gonna look back

and realize these days on campus,

they were the last days

you were truly free.

</line>


<line>
You want "free"?

</line>


<line>
Check out the <name type="ORG">Smirnoff</name> Ice gifting suite

at the <ital>Emmy Awards</ital> after-party!

</line>


<line>
My whole career, all I wanted

was to get to a place like this,

and I didn't even know it.

</line>


<line>
Out there, there's nothing to protect you.

</line>


<line>
No, but there's a <name type="GPE">Patagonia</name> jacket

that says "Birthday Dad" on it

that you get from being on "Birthday Dad."

</line>


<line>
We're safe here, Stan.

Please, don't make the mistake I did.

</line>


<line>
Come on, you'll get your own chair

with your name on it!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] Damn it.

-Oh, good boy. Yes, he's a good boy.

</line>


<line>
Okay, first thing,

we're gonna get these teeth fixed.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[air horns blaring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[vocalizing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="LOC">Mars</name>hmallow?

</line>


<line>
Thanks! [m<name type="ORG">un</name>ching]

</line>


<line>
That was for the child.

</line>


<line>
Oh, should've specified.

</line>


<line>
If she can abstain from eating

the marshmallow for 15 minutes,

she'll receive an even bigger reward.

</line>


<line>
An even bigger reward than a marshmallow?

</line>


<line>
Remember these times, Ruthie.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzes, beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Go Todd for Maude!

-You're sitting in front of a marshmallow,

and if you don't eat it,

you get a bigger reward in 15 minutes.

</line>


<line>
-What do you do?

-Don't be a sucker, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Eat the marshmallow.

</line>


<line>
Who knows what the world's gonna be like

in 15 minutes?

</line>


<line>
That's all I needed to hear.

</line>


<line>
-Thanks, Maude.

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ruthie giggles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! What have I done?

We've got to find another marshmallow!

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzes, beeps]

-Hey, Todd. You've got <name type="ORG">the Maude Squad</name>.

</line>


<line>
Just kidding, it's just Maude.

I don't have a squad.

</line>


<line>
Maude? I didn't go to college.

</line>


<line>
-Where can I get a marshmallow?

-The dining hall?

</line>


<line>
Dining hall?

This is <name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name>, not Hogwarts.

</line>


<line>
What's in a marshmallow anyway?

Maybe I can make one.

</line>


<line>
I think they're mostly chemicals.

</line>


<line>
To the chemistry lab!

</line>


<line>
-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts] You! Make me a marshmallow!

-[Ruthie giggles]

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to cure brain cancer.

</line>


<line>
That's not important right now!

</line>


<line>
If I don't get a new marshmallow,

some psychiatrist

is gonna get mad at this baby.

</line>


<line>
A psychiatrist?

</line>


<line>
I am so sick of the soft sciences

wagging the dog

in conversations

of behavioral development.

</line>


<line>
Let's teach them a lesson!

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.

-What? Why?

</line>


<line>
Because you ate the marshmallow.

Good day, sir.

</line>


<line>
Doctor?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You did it!

</line>


<line>
Hello, my name is Willie <name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name>,

and you've won the school, my boy!

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name> University is yours.

</line>


<line>
What? Why?

</line>


<line>
Somebody needs to keep

that stuffy old board of trustees in check

once I've shed this mortal skin.

</line>


<line>
-Oh...

-Sorry about that.

</line>


<line>
We're doing LSD research

in the room next door.

</line>


<line>
-Come on, Mr. Phillips. <name type="ORG">Time</name> to go.

-[laughing]

</line>


<line>
The frozzleberries

taste like banozzleberries!

</line>


<line>
Yes, Mr. Phillips,

everything tastes like something.

</line>


<line>
So this is college.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[drum roll]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[knocks on door]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-You wanted to see me?

-Amy, yeah. Um, have a seat.

</line>


<line>
So we're nearing

the end of the semester here,

and I'm putting together the cast sheet

for the student showcase.

</line>


<line>
-Uh-huh.

-This showcase is a big deal.

</line>


<line>
This might so<name type="ORG">un</name>d crazy coming from

famous television star, BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

but in some ways,

this showcase means even more to me

than the very popular TV shows

that, again, I was the star of.

</line>


<line>
-It means a lot to me, too.

-Does it?

</line>


<line>
'Cause you've been missing

a lot of classes.

</line>


<line>
And forgetting your lines.

You seem tired all the time, and...

</line>


<line>
I can be better. I'll prove it.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
As the water rose, I remember

fumbling through the glove compartment,

just praying

that I could find a pin hammer

so I could shatter the window.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, excuse me, is this...

-No. Nope, no, no, no. Get out of here.

</line>


<line>
-This has to stop.

-What?

</line>


<line>
This is a place for people who are serious

about making a change,

not for desperate acting students

pretending to have problems, Amy.

</line>


<line>
I was just trying to get help!

</line>


<line>
-Oof!

-[crying]

</line>


<line>
Oh! Oops! That was...

</line>


<line>
Oops.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, do you know what this show's about?

-I think it's about to start.

</line>


<line>
So keep your rugby voice

on the field, okay?

</line>


<line>
It turns out my hypothesis was correct.

Kids love marshmallows.

</line>


<line>
You don't say.

</line>


<line>
You still working on that memoir?

</line>


<line>
Well, f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny story about that...

</line>


<line>
Oh, I love when stories start like that!

Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

</line>


<line>
Where the hell is she?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Horse</name> professor, we're ready when you are.

</line>


<line>
Lights.

</line>


<line>
-[applause]

-Hello.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. Oh, wow, thank you.

That's very nice, thank you.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to

"An Evening of Modern <name type="GPE">America</name>n Scenes."

</line>


<line>
The students are very excited

to perform for you tonight.

</line>


<line>
They've come such a long way

over the course of the semester.

</line>


<line>
Like, a really-- a really long way.

They were very bad before.

</line>


<line>
But now...

</line>


<line>
Well, I mean,

you'll see for yourself, uh...

</line>


<line>
But, um, I'm proud of them.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, first up is a scene

from Sam <name type="NORP">German</name>-Shepherd's "Real <name type="GPE">America</name>."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crowd whooping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You think real <name type="GPE">America</name>'s

all about cowboys?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[line ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, I say real <name type="GPE">America</name>'s about business!

And capitalism!

</line>


<line>
-[voicemail] <ital>Hey, it's <name type="ORG">Hollyhock</name>.</ital>

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Leave a message, if you're a h<name type="ORG">un</name>dred.</ital>

-God damn it.

</line>


<line>
I'm starting to think the real <name type="GPE">America</name>

is me kicking your ass!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase!

</line>


<line>
Tawnie's gonna be so pissed!

</line>


<line>
Forget Tawnie. I'm pissed!

And it's happening right now.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I forgot.

</line>


<line>
I know your students just have to do

a scene, but I have multiple final papers.

</line>


<line>
If you're implying

acting is a bullshit major, you're right.

</line>


<line>
But people came all the way

from <name type="GPE">California</name> to see my showcase.

</line>


<line>
From <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>.

You can't even walk across campus?

</line>


<line>
Okay, let me put some pants on.

</line>


<line>
-You've been avoiding me all semester.

-I just have a lot going on.

</line>


<line>
I go to school here.

I'm a college student.

</line>


<line>
-I thought I'd see you more.

-This was mine before you got here.

</line>


<line>
This was my life, my world,

and you just, like, live here now.

</line>


<line>
And you could have asked me, by the way.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm sorry.

I guess I thought my sister...

</line>


<line>
No, don't say that.

Like it means something.

</line>


<line>
-It does mean something.

-We don't know each other, really.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-No, I'm just saying it's fine.

</line>


<line>
I had a life before I met you,

and you had a life before you met me.

</line>


<line>
I don't want that life.

</line>


<line>
That life, that person?

That's not who I am, I...

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I came here

without asking you first.

</line>


<line>
That was selfish.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
If this is too weird for you,

I don't have to come back next semester.

</line>


<line>
I can get a job somewhere else.

</line>


<line>
Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.

</line>


<line>
She did? Huh.

I thought you were in a fight.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but I still love her.

</line>


<line>
Are we in a fight?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I should get back to the show.

</line>


<line>
If you want to come back in the fall,

that could be cool.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-Just...

</line>


<line>
We need to take things slow, you know?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Terry in raspy voice]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And in that moment,</ital>

<ital>I knew this was my home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And as long as I was here,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'd be safe.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-But then again, what do I know?

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
I'm just a 15-year-old boy

living in Brighton Beach.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering, applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> Yeah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Horse</name> professor.

</line>


<line>
-Come on. Get up here.

-No, no, no.

</line>


<line>
-Get up here.

-No, no, no. Come on.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Thank you so much.

<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uh... Hello?

</line>


<line>
-You need to stop this.

-What?

</line>


<line>
The reporters who keep trying

to get <name type="ORG">Penn</name>y to tell her story.

</line>


<line>
What-- What reporters?

</line>


<line>
Whatever they're doing,

I don't want to be included, okay?

</line>


<line>
I don't want my daughter to be included.

</line>


<line>
Charlotte, I swear, I don't know

what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
-Well, you better figure it out.
