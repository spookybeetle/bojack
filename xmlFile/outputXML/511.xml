</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Now I see

why they call you "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
-Hello, old friend.

-<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name>! But you're dead!

</line>


<line>
Dead serious... about haunting you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I haven't had sex that good

since my wife died.

</line>


<line>
To be clear, the sex was pre-death.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>, I don't want to be

one of those girls,

but did you murder your wife?

</line>


<line>
How many people are dead because of you?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hose were bad guys!

They stole the mayor's submarine.

</line>


<line>
Tell me what happened.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to the chief!

The whole world's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> know what you did.

</line>


<line>
-You can't do that, Marjorie.

-<name type="PERSON">John</name>, it's over. [gasps]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name>, you maniac! What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
-What you're too chickenshit to do.

-[gasping] <name type="PERSON">John</name>! Help!

</line>


<line>
-Oh-hh!

You shot your partner?

</line>


<line>
He was strangling my wife!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kiss</name> me, you smart, handsome renegade.

</line>

There's no time for that now.

The nuclear missiles are coming.

<ital>The air is thick</ital>

Hey, partner. Looks like you're getting

soft... serve frozen yogurt.

<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Now I continue to see

why they call you "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[narrating]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's also been six months</ital>

<ital>About <name type="PERSON">Fritz</name>. My wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And <name type="ORG">Sassy</name> hasn't turned me in.</ital>

<ital>I think she likes me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[bell rings]

-[spits] Ugh!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I told you

not to eat the prop food.

</line>


<line>
That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup!

</line>


<line>
Why?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's been two months since</ital>

<ital>the first season of <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> came out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And it's a hit. Which is great for me,</ital>

<ital>but even better for <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutters clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know, I've done so many TV shows,

</line>


<line>
but this is the first one

that's kind of turned me into a star.

</line>


<line>
It's a big step up from just recurring

on<ital> The Cops are Coming,</ital>

<ital>Whee-oo, Whee-oo.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And the weird part is</ital>

<ital>I'm not secretly bitter and jealous.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I like seeing her happy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But I still have this little rancid itch</ital>

<ital>saying something isn't right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's like there's always something</ital>

<ital>lurking just beyond the horizon.</ital>

I see. Thank you.

<line>
Why do you still use a landline?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>What am I supposed to tell her,</ital>

<ital>I'm just an old-fashioned guy?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Or maybe I like things</ital>

<ital>that are plugged to the wall?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Something to grab onto</ital>

<ital>if I start floating away.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That was my wife's landline.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name> grunting]

</line>


<line>
-I'm so sorry.

-Never mind that.

</line>


<line>
The chief's been murdered.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>, that's awful.

I know you didn't want him to be murdered.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>, put on some pants.

You've got a sweet bottom,

</line>


<line>
but the only bottom

I'm interested in right now

</line>


<line>
is the bottom of this case,

and getting to it.

</line>


<line>
Because this time, it's personnel.

</line>


<line>
-Cut!

-[bell rings]

</line>


<line>
Did you want me to say,

"This time it's <ital>personal"?</ital>

</line>


<line>
No, that's a cliché.

You're saying it's an inside job.

</line>


<line>
Someone on the force.

"This time, it's <ital>personnel."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Ah, okay.

-The strangling looks fake.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier...

[wailing] if I talked like this--

</line>


<line>
I already told you. No spooky voice!

</line>


<line>
I can roll my eyes back

and stick my tongue out.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gagging]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Eh...?

-Yeah, let's try that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, you noticed anything funky

about these new scripts?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Without <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> around to police

<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>'s use of the word "literally,"

</line>


<line>
you'd think "the literally store"

was going out of business. Figuratively.

</line>


<line>
What? No. I mean the story with the chief.

I think it's stolen from my life.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I also had a male boss w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> died.

<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> Kazazz.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a coincidence.

</line>


<line>
The chief is named <name type="PERSON">Basil</name>.

Like basil, which is an herb! Like <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
I don't think anyone would use a story

from your life without telling you.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> would.

-She's not writing on the show anymore.

</line>


<line>
You think <name type="PERSON">Flip</name> read her book?

Wait a minute. "Her book." "<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>... <ital>ook."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What's going on with you?

-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get to the bottom of this

because this time, it's business.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Personal </ital>business.

</line>


<line>
Hey, friend.

Where'd you get your ideas from?

</line>


<line>
I'm just-- I'm so interested

in your process.

</line>


<line>
Do you make them up,

or get inspired

by other things or people's... lives?

</line>


<line>
What are you accusing me of?

</line>


<line>
You think I can't come up

with my own ideas?

<ital>I must be singing a song called "Crazy"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>because everyone's treating me</ital>

<ital>like a patsy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>All I know for sure</ital>

<ital>is <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>'s hiding something.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Something about "popsicle guys."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, buddy. Is everything okay in here?

-Yeah, fine.

</line>


<line>
Really? Because this trailer belongs

to <name type="PERSON">Stingray Liotta</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gurgling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, I guess I've been

a little distracted.

</line>


<line>
Are you sure you're okay?

Because you're my friend,

and I would never forgive myself

if something happened to you

that affected our ability

to stay on schedule.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I care about you,

and also the 218 other people

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> will be out of a job

if you spin out like you usually do.

Now are you keeping things together?

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> screw up

this professional opportunity for you.

</line>


<line>
Your concern is very touching.

</line>


<line>
-What's in those pills you keep taking?

-If you really cared,

you should've been there

the day I fell off a building?

</line>


<line>
But no. You had other important business

to attend to.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>--

-You're doing a great job,

making me feel like you give a shit.

You're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be an awesome mom.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I think you're overworked.

</line>


<line>
Oh, for real?

With a side order of,

</line>


<line>
"Ya think?"

And <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>dry retorts of that fashion.

</line>


<line>
Here's what's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> happen.

</line>


<line>
You're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> take

the rest of the night off.

</line>


<line>
You're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get some sleep.

</line>


<line>
And when you come back,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be professional,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be courteous,

and you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have your shit together.

</line>


<line>
Fine! And... I'm sorry,

about the mom thing.

</line>


<line>
Get some sleep.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I can't sleep.

-Ugh. Yeah, you mentioned.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Flip</name> was acting very suspicious.

-He sure was. Eight hours ago.

</line>


<line>
But we're home now,

and it's 4:00 in the morning.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn's getting

all up in my business!

</line>


<line>
She told me that I seem "not okay,"

and was "spinning out,"

</line>


<line>
-and "would make a great mom."

-Not sure you'd be the best mom.

</line>


<line>
-I'd be a wonderful mother!

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> level with you.

I'm in a real situation here

because I did not realize I was supposed

to sell ads for this show.

</line>


<line>
Nobody specifically told me

that was under the purview

of the president of ad sales!

</line>


<line>
So, if anyone wants to buy

30 million dollars'-worth of ad time,

or work out

some sort of licensing arrangement,

basically, what you need to know about me

is I am desperate

and will say yes to anything.

</line>


<line>
Let the negotiations begin!

Did the<ital> <name type="GPE">L.A.</name> Gazette</ital> come today?

</line>

Uh, no, nothing came today!

I wasn't looking at anything.

Why are you so insistent

<ital>-All right.</ital>

I've got time for a survey.

about what little old <name type="PERSON">Kyle</name> thinks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[speaking with mock Scottish accent]</nonVerbComm>

On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate your cable service?

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.

Let's see.

</line>


<line>
Don't take this personally,

but I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> say eight.

</line>


<line>
And on a scale of one to ten,

how is your marriage?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's a little personal,

don't ya think?

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay. Uh...

</line>


<line>
But I guess if it helps your survey--

my wife and I had some rough patches,

but we're stronger

now we've got through them.

</line>


<line>
-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give us an eight.

-Okay, so it sounds like your wife

isn't obsessed with a desire

to exact revenge on a former friend?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

</line>


<line>
-I don't think so.

-Okay, wonderful.

</line>


<line>
On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate

your daughter's sexual maturity?

</line>


<line>
-Boy, that's a sticky one.

-I'm just reading what's in front of me.

<name type="PERSON">Pfft</name>. I don't even know how to judge that.

that one is, "Horribly scarred

by an older man she trusted

and is now dedicated to getting

the word out about the bad thing he did,"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[normal voice]</nonVerbComm>

and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

in a healthy way on her own timetable

and is now completely emotionally

well-adjusted?"

</line>


<line>
I don't know, maybe eight?

</line>


<line>
I feel like I'm kind of defaulting

to eights.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, thanks, bye!

<ital>-Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Question number one.

What channel is Netflix?

</line>


<line>
Gotta get back to <name type="GPE">Scotland</name>.

You're the man now, dawg.

</line>


<line>
Well, that didn't pan out.

</line>


<line>
We got no leads,

and the <name type="PERSON">Olive</name> Garden won't deliver.

</line>


<line>
Sure, when you're there, you're "family."

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be something we're not

seeing. All these victims, strangled.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, this case just gets

strangler and strangler.

</line>


<line>
You made puns!

</line>


<line>
You could laugh after two murders.

</line>


<line>
But now we're talking about eight

innocent people killed in five days!

</line>


<line>
This guy's really going full throttle.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I guess it's just funnier

when I do it.

</line>


<line>
-The point is, we have to stop him.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
So many people could have sent that note.

Why do so many people hate me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, put up a picture of <name type="PERSON">Crispin Glover</name>.

</line>


<line>
Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt

in a dream he had.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure production assistants

are supposed to help make lists

of enemies.

</line>


<line>
Hey, if you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> whine like that,

put your own picture on the wall too.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, what time is it?

I gotta get to set.

</line>


<line>
We <ital>are</ital> on set.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[buzzing, popping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> I'm telling you, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s onto us!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, he's not onto anything.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>]</nonVerbComm> I think he knows

about the popsicle guys!

</line>


<line>
-Wha--?

-<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, about dinner tonight,

am I any network with a show

starring <name type="PERSON">Kyle</name> Bornheimer?

</line>


<line>
-Because I have to cancel.

-Shh, shh, shh!

</line>


<line>
Nothing's wrong.

Just another heavy night of shooting.

</line>


<line>
-Sha-sha-shh!

-Gotta go! Love you!

</line>


<line>
-Shh! Shh!

-Love being monogamous!

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-[sighs] Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
Look at you, skulking behind doors

with a malevolent aura.

</line>


<line>
-Someone is hiding something.

-How did you know?

</line>


<line>
-Did you talk to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

-Yes. I did talk to <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I promise it was a one-time thing.

</line>


<line>
The worst thing that could happen is

if I lost your respect over this.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't live with myself

if your respect for me fell any lower

than the current level of respect

you have for me,

which as we both know is very high.

</line>


<line>
Can we pretend

this whole thing never happened?

</line>


<line>
-What whole thing?

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be a simple explanation.

</line>


<line>
No. I'm telling you,

this whole thing is rotten, <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] You said "<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>" again!

-What?

</line>


<line>
You called her "<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>."

The character's name is "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
Right. Um, no.

This whole thing is rotten, <name type="ORG">Sassy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

we'll figure it out together, okay?

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-In the morning.

We're not so different, you and I.

In fact, in many ways,

you might even say we're the same.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Samie</name>, <name type="GPE">samie</name>, <name type="GPE">samie</name>-same,

you might say.

</line>


<line>
Twinsies, even.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Fritz</name>, you're not real.

-Does this feel real enough for ya?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> You don't have to do this.

You can trust me.

</line>


<line>
I do trust you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
But I don't trust <ital>her.</ital>

</line>


<line>

<line>
And that's why I still have a landline.

</line>

What's going on? I'm a heavy sleeper.

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> thinking]</nonVerbComm> <ital>He's got a secret</ital>

<ital>he won't tell me. And he's not alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's why she keeps checking on me--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>to make sure that I'm not getting</ital>

<ital>too close to the truth.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> else is in on it?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Mr. Peanutbutter. He's up to something.</ital>

<ital>Something involving... <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But what do they all have in...</ital>

<ital>Common?</ital>

</line>


<line>
They all made <ital><name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
This whole show is designed

to reveal my secrets and destroy me.

</line>


<line>
And poor <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> is caught up in the madness.

I have to find a way protect her! Get it?

</line>


<line>
Everyone's evil.

It's a conspiracy to destroy you.

</line>


<line>
Protect <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>. Got it.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Fascinating Mysteries</ital>

<ital>of Detective <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> Is Great...</ital>

will continue after this.

</line>


<line>
What...?

</line>


<line>
I really think we should get to set.

</line>


<line>
-Aren't we on set?

-You're at home.

</line>


<line>
I came to get you

because you didn't show up at call time.

</line>


<line>
Why didn't you come earlier? [gasps]

Are you trying to take me down, too?

</line>


<line>
Down... to set.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name> groaning]

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> gasping]

</line>


<line>
Hey, everyone!

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s here, ready to shoot!

</line>


<line>
-What are we waiting for? Come on.

-All right, set it up!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, what's going on with you?

</line>


<line>
I can't tell her the truth.

She's safer knowing nothing.

</line>


<line>
-You realize you just said that out loud?

-Oh. Sorry. Too many night shoots.

</line>


<line>
It's so hard to lie to her.

</line>


<line>
You just said that out loud, too.

You do know this is real, right?

</line>


<line>
More real than you even know, dollface.

</line>


<line>
Face. Clocks have faces.

</line>


<line>
That's it! [gasping]

</line>


<line>
Where the hell is he going?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[muttering]</nonVerbComm> Gotta get 'em...

Gotta go. Gotta catch up.

</line>


<line>
-[yelps]

-Todd <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>. The man in charge.

</line>


<line>
The guy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has a face,

which is what clocks have,

and also hands, which clocks have, too.

</line>


<line>
I should have known his clocky-handy face

was behind this.

</line>


<line>
-Hi, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

-The gif is up, bozzo.

</line>


<line>
-Spill the beefs.

-Okay, you got me.

</line>


<line>
In order to offset the costs

of video hosting,

</line>


<line>
I needed to sign a licensing deal

with a pharmaceutical company,

but I think this still maintains

the dignity of <name type="PERSON">Flip</name>'s original vision.

</line>


<line>
"Oopsie, gotta poopsie"?

</line>


<line>
That sounds like a thing

<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name> would say, right?

</line>


<line>
We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox,

and a campaign with a national taco chain.

</line>


<line>
The "Philburrito." So zesty,

you'll forget your murdered wife.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> So, you wrote the note!

</line>


<line>
-Uh, no, that's--

-Tell me the truth, <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>!

</line>


<line>
Have you always been

secretly jealous of me?

</line>


<line>
Did you hate that you were a nothing

and I was a successful cop?

</line>


<line>
Did you create this entire

television show to destroy me?

</line>


<line>
That's a lotta questions,

but, generally, no.

</line>


<line>
-This ends now.

-Hey, whoa, whoa, careful!

take the show down.

So, what, you solve this little mystery,

fix this little hole,

I'm doing this for you.

You don't want that.

in the toilet paper rolls.

Then I looked around the house

and found all your other

I didn't want to tell you this,

I don't know how. Maybe the nuclear blast

resurrected him somehow.

You're my partner. We need to find him.

I'm with <name type="ORG">Internal Affairs</name>, you moron.

there's no record of him ever existing.

You killed your wife. And the chief.
