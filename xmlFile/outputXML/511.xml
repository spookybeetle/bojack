<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Previously on</ital> Philbert...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Now I see

why they call you "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
-Hello, old friend.

-Fritz! But you're dead!

</line>


<line>
Dead serious... about ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ting you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I haven't had sex that good

since my wife died.

</line>


<line>
To be clear, the sex was pre-death.

</line>


<line>
Philbert, I don't want to be

one of those girls,

but did you murder your wife?

</line>


<line>
How many people are dead because of you?

</line>


<line>
Those were bad guys!

They stole the mayor's submarine.

</line>


<line>
Tell me what happened.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to the chief!

The whole world's gonna know what you did.

</line>


<line>
-You can't do that, Marjorie.

-John, it's over. [gasps]

</line>


<line>
Fritz, you maniac! What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
-What you're too chickenshit to do.

-[gasping] John! Help!

</line>


<line>
-Oh-hh!

-[moaning]

<nonVerbComm>[Fritz gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You shot your partner?

</line>


<line>
He was strangling my wife!

</line>


<line>
Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.

</line>


<line>
There's no time for that now.

The nuclear missiles are coming.

<nonVerbComm>[Philbert narrating]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's been six months</ital>

<ital>since the missiles hit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The air is thick</ital>

<ital>with the stench of death,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and the hospitals are delivering</ital>

<ital>some very wacky babies.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But, finally, they reopened</ital>

<ital>the <name type="LOC">Yogurtland</name> near me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sometimes, even mushroom clouds</ital>

<ital>have a silver lining.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, partner. Looks like you're getting

soft... serve frozen yogurt.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Now I continue to see

why they call you "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[narrating]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's also been six months</ital>

<ital>since I told <name type="ORG">Sassy</name> the truth.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>About Fritz. My wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And <name type="ORG">Sassy</name> hasn't turned me in.</ital>

<ital>I think she likes me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="ORG">Sassy</name> sighs]

-[Flip] Cut!

</line>


<line>
-[bell rings]

-[spits] Ugh!

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I told you

not to eat the prop food.

</line>


<line>
That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup!

</line>


<line>
Why?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's been two months since</ital>

<ital>the first season of Philbert came out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And it's a hit. Which is great for me,</ital>

<ital>but even better for Gina.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[camera shutters clicking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know, I've done so many TV shows,

</line>


<line>
but this is the first one

that's kind of turned me into a star.

</line>


<line>
It's a big step up from just recurring

on<ital> The Cops are Coming,</ital>

<ital>Whee-oo, Whee-oo.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And the weird part is</ital>

<ital>I'm not <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly bitter and jealous.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I like seeing her happy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But I still have this little rancid itch</ital>

<ital>saying something isn't right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's like there's always something</ital>

<ital>lurking just beyond the horizon.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Philbert the Troubled Detective.

</line>


<line>
I see. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Why do you still use a landline?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Philbert]</nonVerbComm> <ital>What am I supposed to tell her,</ital>

<ital>I'm just an old-fashioned guy?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Or maybe I like things</ital>

<ital>that are plugged to the wall?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Something to grab onto</ital>

<ital>if I start floating away.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That was my wife's landline.

</line>


<line>
-[Fritz gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting]

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
-I'm so sorry.

-Never mind that.

</line>


<line>
The chief's been murdered.

</line>


<line>
Oh, Philbert, that's awful.

I know you didn't want him to be murdered.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>, put on some pants.

You've got a sweet bottom,

</line>


<line>
but the only bottom

I'm interested in right now

</line>


<line>
is the bottom of this case,

and getting to it.

</line>


<line>
Because this time, it's personnel.

</line>


<line>
-Cut!

-[bell rings]

</line>


<line>
Did you want me to say,

"This time it's <ital>personal"?</ital>

</line>


<line>
No, that's a cliché.

You're saying it's an inside job.

</line>


<line>
Someone on the force.

"This time, it's <ital>personnel."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Ah, okay.

-The strangling looks fake.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier...

[wailing] if I talked like this--

</line>


<line>
I already told you. No spooky voice!

</line>


<line>
I can roll my eyes back

and stick my tongue out.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gagging]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Eh...?

-Yeah, let's try that.

</line>


<line>
Gina, you noticed anything f<name type="ORG">un</name>ky

about these new scripts?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Without Diane aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d to police

Flip's use of the word "literally,"

</line>


<line>
you'd think "the literally store"

was going out of business. Figuratively.

</line>


<line>
What? No. I mean the story with the chief.

I think it's stolen from my life.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I also had a male boss who died.

Herb <name type="GPE">Kazaz</name>z.

</line>


<line>
Seems like a coincidence.

</line>


<line>
The chief is named Basil.

Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.

</line>


<line>
I don't think anyone would use a story

from your life without telling you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-Diane</name> would.

-She's not writing on the show anymore.

</line>


<line>
You think Flip read her book?

Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb... <ital>ook."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What's going on with you?

-I'm gonna get to the bottom of this

because this time, it's business.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Personal </ital>business.

</line>


<line>
-[typing]

-[knocking on door]

</line>


<line>
Hey, friend.

Where'd you get your ideas from?

</line>


<line>
I'm just-- I'm so interested

in your process.

</line>


<line>
Do you make them up,

or get inspired

by other things or people's... lives?

</line>


<line>
What are you accusing me of?

</line>


<line>
You think I can't come up

with my own ideas?

</line>


<line>
Those popsicle guys signed a release.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Popsicle</name> guys?

</line>


<line>
-What are you talking about?

-What are <ital>you </ital>talking about?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Something's going on.</ital>

<ital>I must be singing a song called "Crazy"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>because everyone's treating me</ital>

<ital>like a patsy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>All I know for sure</ital>

<ital>is Flip's hiding something.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Something about "popsicle guys."</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, buddy. Is everything okay in here?

-Yeah, fine.

</line>


<line>
Really? Because this trailer belongs

to Stingray Liotta.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gurgling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, I guess I've been

a little distracted.

</line>


<line>
Are you sure you're okay?

Because you're my friend,

and I would never forgive myself

if something happened to you

that affected our ability

to stay on schedule.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-BoJack, I care about you,

and also the 218 other people

who will be out of a job

if you spin out like you usually do.

Now are you keeping things together?

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna screw up

this professional opport<name type="ORG">un</name>ity for you.

</line>


<line>
Your concern is very touching.

</line>


<line>
-What's in those pills you keep taking?

-If you really cared,

you should've been there

the day I fell off a building?

</line>


<line>
But no. You had other important business

to attend to.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">BoJack--</name>

-You're doing a great job,

making me feel like you give a shit.

You're gonna be an awesome mom.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I think you're overworked.

</line>


<line>
Oh, for real?

With a side order of,

</line>


<line>
"Ya think?"

And s<name type="ORG">un</name>dry retorts of that fashion.

</line>


<line>
Here's what's gonna happen.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna take

the rest of the night off.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna get some sleep.

</line>


<line>
And when you come back,

you're gonna be professional,

you're gonna be courteous,

and you're gonna have your shit together.

</line>


<line>
Fine! And... I'm sorry,

about the mom thing.

</line>


<line>
Get some sleep.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I can't sleep.

-Ugh. Yeah, you mentioned.

</line>


<line>
-Flip was acting very suspicious.

-He sure was. Eight hours ago.

</line>


<line>
But we're home now,

and it's 4:00 in the morning.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn's getting

all up in my business!

</line>


<line>
She told me that I seem "not okay,"

and was "spinning out,"

</line>


<line>
-and "would make a great mom."

-Not sure you'd be the best mom.

</line>


<line>
-I'd be a wonderful mother!

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thinking]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Watch it, BoJack.</ital>

<ital>You're losing it. Gotta be cool for Gina.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What's something a cool person would say?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh, hey, Daddy-O.

</line>


<line>
Gotta splitsville to the lavatory

if you catch my drift. Hang ten!

</line>

Is everyone having a good time?

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

I'm in a real situation here

because I did not realize I was supposed

to sell ads for this show.

</line>


<line>
Nobody specifically told me

that was <name type="ORG">un</name>der the purview

of the president of ad sales!

</line>


<line>
So, if anyone wants to buy

30 million dollars'-worth of ad time,

or work out

some sort of licensing arrangement,

basically, what you need to know about me

is I am desperate

and will say yes to anything.

</line>


<line>
Let the negotiations begin!

</line>


<line>
-[music resumes]

-And now, back to the show.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack thinking]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Who sent this? What do they know?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do they know things? Let's find out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, BoJack!

Did the<ital> L.A. Gazette</ital> come today?

</line>


<line>
Apparently, I'm on their

"35 Over 35 but Under 40" list.

</line>


<line>
Uh, no, nothing came today!

I wasn't looking at anything.

</line>


<line>
Why are you so insistent

that something came today?

</line>


<line>
Obsessed with things coming much?

This case is like the movie,

<ital>Love Actually.</ital> No leads.

</line>


<line>
-Hope the coroner can help us out.

-She will.

</line>


<line>
We got a lot of history,

me and the coroner.

Here's a picture.

-What note?

-What <ital>note?</ital>

</line>


<line>
The one you slipped <name type="ORG">un</name>der my door.

</line>


<line>
See, great actors embody their roles,

so I've picked up some detective skills.

</line>


<line>
That letter "I" is in a nerd font.

I'd say it's from<ital> The Believer.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And you're the only person

who reads<ital> The Believer.</ital>

</line>


<line>
First of all, <ital>The Believer</ital>

is a very popular $12 magazine.

</line>


<line>
And I didn't send this dumb note.

</line>


<line>
You love revealing my <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets.

And not sharing your cobbler!

</line>

If it's the same killer,

he's a real pain in the neck.

Hey, there's being sassy,

and there's going over the line

with humor. Literally.

</line>

All right, enough chokes.

All right, you get another <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond here.

What's going on?

</line>


<line>
-I'm doing a survey for the cable company.

<ital>-All right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I've got time for a survey.

Kinda f<name type="ORG">un</name> to think

big-time corporations care

about what little old Kyle thinks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[speaking with mock <name type="NORP">Scottish</name> accent]</nonVerbComm>

On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate your cable service?

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.

Let's see.

</line>


<line>
Don't take this personally,

but I'm gonna say eight.

</line>


<line>
And on a scale of one to ten,

how is your marriage?

</line>


<line>
Well, that's a little personal,

don't ya think?

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay. Uh...

</line>


<line>
But I guess if it helps your survey--

my wife and I had some rough patches,

but we're stronger

now we've got through them.

</line>


<line>
-I'm gonna give us an eight.

-Okay, so it so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like your wife

isn't obsessed with a desire

to exact revenge on a former friend?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

</line>


<line>
-I don't think so.

-Okay, wonderful.

</line>


<line>
On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate

your daughter's sexual maturity?

</line>


<line>
-Boy, that's a sticky one.

-I'm just reading what's in front of me.

</line>


<line>
Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.

</line>


<line>
Uh, let's say

that one is, "Horribly scarred

by an older man she trusted

and is now dedicated to getting

the word out about the bad thing he did,"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[normal voice]</nonVerbComm>

and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

in a healthy way on her own timetable

and is now completely emotionally

well-adjusted?"

</line>


<line>
I don't know, maybe eight?

</line>


<line>
I feel like I'm kind of defaulting

to eights.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, thanks, bye!

<ital>-Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Question number one.

What channel is Netflix?

</line>


<line>
Gotta get back to <name type="GPE">Scotland</name>.

You're the man now, dawg.

</line>


<line>
Well, that didn't pan out.

</line>


<line>
We got no leads,

and <name type="FAC">the Olive Garden</name> won't deliver.

</line>


<line>
Sure, when you're there, you're "family."

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be something we're not

seeing. All these victims, strangled.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, this case just gets

strangler and strangler.

</line>


<line>
You made p<name type="ORG">un</name>s!

</line>


<line>
You could laugh after two murders.

</line>


<line>
But now we're talking about eight

innocent people killed in five days!

</line>


<line>
This guy's really going full throttle.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I guess it's just f<name type="ORG">un</name>nier

when I do it.

</line>


<line>
-The point is, we have to stop him.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
So many people could have sent that note.

Why do so many people hate me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.

</line>


<line>

in a dream he had.

I'm not sure production assistants

are supposed to help make lists

of enemies.

Hey, if you're gonna whine like that,

put your own picture on the wall too.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, what time is it?

I gotta get to set.

We <ital>are</ital> on set.

Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.

<nonVerbComm>[Flip]</nonVerbComm> I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us!

<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, he's not onto anything.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Flip]</nonVerbComm> I think he knows

about the popsicle guys!

</line>


<line>
-Wha--?

-Pickles, about dinner tonight,

am I any network with a show

starring Kyle Bornheimer?

</line>


<line>
-Because I have to cancel.

-Shh, shh, shh!

</line>


<line>
Nothing's wrong.

Just another heavy night of shooting.

</line>


<line>
-Sha-sha-shh!

-Gotta go! Love you!

</line>


<line>
-Shh! Shh!

-Love being monogamous!

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-[sighs] Hey, BoJack!

</line>


<line>
Look at you, skulking behind doors

with a malevolent aura.

</line>


<line>
-Someone is hiding something.

-How did you know?

</line>


<line>
-Did you talk to Diane?

-Yes. I did talk to Diane.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I promise it was a one-time thing.

</line>


<line>
The worst thing that could happen is

if I lost your respect over this.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't live with myself

if your respect for me fell any lower

than the current level of respect

you have for me,

which as we both know is very high.

</line>


<line>
Can we pretend

this whole thing never happened?

</line>


<line>
-What whole thing?

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be a simple explanation.

</line>


<line>
No. I'm telling you,

this whole thing is rotten, Gina.

</line>


<line>
-[Flip] You said "Gina" again!

-What?

</line>


<line>
You called her "Gina."

The character's name is "<name type="ORG">Sassy</name>."

</line>


<line>
Right. Um, no.

This whole thing is rotten, <name type="ORG">Sassy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

we'll figure it out together, okay?

This whole show is designed

And poor Gina is caught up in the madness.

I have to find a way protect her! Get it?

Everyone's evil.

It's a conspiracy to destroy you.

Protect Gina. Got it.

<ital>The Fascinating Mysteries</ital>

What...?

</line>


<line>
I really think we should get to set.

</line>


<line>
-Aren't we on set?

-You're at home.

</line>


<line>
I came to get you

because you didn't show up at call time.

</line>


<line>
Why didn't you come earlier? [gasps]

Are you trying to take me down, too?

</line>


<line>
Down... to set.

</line>


<line>
-[Flip groaning]

-[BoJack gasping]

</line>

Hey, everyone!

BoJack's here, ready to shoot!

</line>


<line>
-What are we waiting for? Come on.

-All right, set it up!

</line>


<line>
BoJack, what's going on with you?

</line>


<line>
I can't tell her the truth.

She's safer knowing nothing.

</line>


<line>
-You realize you just said that out loud?

-Oh. Sorry. Too many night shoots.

</line>


<line>
It's so hard to lie to her.

</line>


<line>
You just said that out loud, too.

You do know this is real, right?

</line>


<line>
More real than you even know, dollface.

</line>

Face. Clocks have faces.

-Todd Chavez. The man in charge.

</line>


<line>
The guy who has a face,

which is what clocks have,

and also hands, which clocks have, too.

</line>


<line>
I should have known his clocky-handy face

was behind this.

</line>


<line>
-Hi, BoJack!

-The gif is up, bozzo.

</line>


<line>
-Spill the beefs.

-Okay, you got me.

</line>


<line>
In order to offset the costs

of video hosting,

</line>


<line>
I needed to sign a licensing deal

with a pharmaceutical company,

but I think this still maintains

the dignity of Flip's original vision.

Philbert would say, right?

We're also doing a board game, a l<name type="ORG">un</name>chbox,

and a campaign with a national taco chain.

</line>


<line>
The "Philburrito." So zesty,

you'll forget your murdered wife.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> So, you wrote the note!

</line>


<line>
-Uh, no, that's--

-Tell me the truth, Chavez!

</line>


<line>
Have you always been

<name type="ORG">sec</name>retly jealous of me?

</line>


<line>
Did you hate that you were a nothing

and I was a successful cop?

</line>


<line>
Did you create this entire

That's a lotta questions,

but, generally, no.
