<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Watch out!

</line>


<line>
-Lift with your legs.

-I am lifting with my legs.

</line>


<line>
-Also lift with your arms.

-[Joshua] Is <name type="ORG">Horse</name> Professor okay?

</line>


<line>
Nothing to see here!

</line>


<line>
He just passed out from pride!

Because you kids are so talented!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[students cheering]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think he passed out

from embarrassment?

</line>


<line>
-Because the kids are not talented.

-What happened?

</line>


<line>
He was getting off a p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne call.

</line>


<line>
I had some constructive criticism

about his play.

</line>


<line>
I tried a compliment sandwich

by starting with some praise,

but he passed out!

</line>


<line>
Just goes to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w,

you never know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much time you have

with someone,

so you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld always say

the bad stuff first.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur play sucked!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out. I didn't--

</line>


<line>
-It's not true.

-What's not true?

</line>


<line>
I need to-- Air.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[students singing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital><music>♪ For he's our trusty director ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey can't know.

I didn't even do anything.

</line>


<line>
-It's--

-Slow down.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell us what happened?

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'll tell you.

But you can't talk to anyone.

</line>


<line>
No reporters.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, it's okay.

No one's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> talk to any--

</line>


<line>
Reporters? With questions about

my good friend, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

</line>


<line>
I'd be delighted to talk!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[music playing over stereo]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>,

my endlessly encouraging enfianced.

</line>


<line>
I'm thrilled to report our return

from a prolonged New <name type="NORP">Mexican</name> exodus.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>rue, <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>x and I shared lodging

to husband our expenditures,

and true, too, we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wered together

one night when the tank broke down

and the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t water was scarce,

but other than t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se mild inconveniences,

the fact-finding mission went as fine

as the print at the bottom

of a contract,

and we're close as ever

to sewing things up.

</line>


<line>
So, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> sold the restaurant

to <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name> and me,

</line>


<line>
and we rela<name type="ORG">un</name>ched it with

my fiancée <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> as a themed eatery.

</line>


<line>
What is the theme?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> wanted small plates,

<name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y wanted lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name>s,

and I wanted the theme to be my face

is on the front of the menu.

</line>


<line>
So, we did all three! [laughs]

</line>


<line>
-What's the big idea?

-I'm in the middle of eating!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h? It's the perfect compromise

because everybody got what they wanted,

and nobody had to compromise!

</line>


<line>
-And why is it called <name type="PERSON">Ele</name>-fee-no?

-<name type="PERSON">Ele</name>-fi-no.

</line>


<line>
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!

</line>


<line>
I know this last story

is taking its sweet time,

but once we can tie down

this <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>-Person <name type="ORG">Horse</name>-fellow to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

on the night of her death,

we'll know he procured the final blow,

the blow being not blow but <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse,

a scoop in itself,

</line>


<line>
but I believe the larger story is--

Oh, but here I am bending your ear.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur everlasting patience inspires me.

Do return my call. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">Paige</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name>.

</line>


<line>
-And then I took the boat back to <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's it? How's that a story?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did nothing ille<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l, and even

the not ille<name type="PERSON">ga</name>l thing, you didn't even do.

</line>


<line>
And yet this thing continues

to ha<name type="ORG">un</name>t me, I--

</line>


<line>
-Because it's not about the le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>lity.

-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd] <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane's right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat story is super sketchy.

</line>


<line>
-Is <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> super sketchy? Yes, he is!

-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> laughs]

</line>


<line>
-[po<name type="ORG">un</name>ds on door]

-Can <name type="ORG">Horse</name> Professor come out?

</line>


<line>
 We won't go to the cast party

<name type="ORG">un</name>less our fearless teacher comes with us!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you just have the party here

and he'll pop out when he's ready.

</line>


<line>
Here's some cash.

Go buy some nice cast party things.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[students cheering]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Joshua]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be

the best night ever!

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, you're right.

I've been sketchy.

</line>


<line>
But there's no story here. Right?

</line>


<line>
-Unless <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name> isn't the story.

-Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch

that story, no one would publish it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're working on something bigger.

What did you do this time?

</line>


<line>
I haven't done anything.

</line>


<line>
Since I got out of rehab

I have been on my best behavior.

</line>


<line>
But before rehab...

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey can't get me on old shit.

I'm a different person now.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his could be anything.

-Or a combination of things.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> combo me?

</line>


<line>
Let's take a beat

and figure out what this story is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd</name>, earmuffs.

-On it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, tell us every bad thing

you ever did.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a long night.

</line>


<line>
So, what can I tell you about <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

Nothing bad, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt night!

</line>


<line>
-Right. I-- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur chair, <name type="PERSON">Miss</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Banks</name>.

</line>


<line>
And thank you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

for taking the time to quench our queries.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't take more than

a half <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ur, max.

</line>


<line>
-Yes?

-No, not you <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>x.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>x?

-No, <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>x. I'm talking to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
No, you're talking to <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>x.

I'm Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm talking to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
-Glad we're all on the same page.

-I beg your pardon.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

we have sitch in the kitch.

</line>


<line>
It's a dishwash ish.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he dishwashers all quit?

-It's the small plates.

</line>


<line>
If we just had bigger plates,

we could get more stuff on them

and we wouldn't need so many.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he point of the small plates

is to curate a personalized

dining experience,

but because of your lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name>s,

all the plates keep getting sp<name type="ORG">un</name> aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

and nobody remembers w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> ordered what!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>! And then there's me,

putting my picture on the menu!

</line>


<line>
-What? No one cares about that.

-Yeah, the pic's not the problem.

</line>


<line>
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you start

on t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se dishes?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got it, good buddy.

</line>


<line>
Oh... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, you keep manning the tables.

<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se <name type="PERSON">Susan</name>s aren't <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> laze themselves.

</line>


<line>
Sure. But...

</line>


<line>
Could I talk to you?

</line>


<line>
How much longer do we have

to keep working with that guy?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you loved <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>!

</line>


<line>
I love his music!

</line>


<line>
He's my <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond favorite recording artist

after <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>-Fi Chill-Hop <name type="PERSON">Bea</name>ts

to study/relax to.

</line>


<line>
I love <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>-Fi Chill-Hop <name type="PERSON">Bea</name>ts

to study/relax to!

</line>


<line>
And I love you!

</line>


<line>
But <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>'s like your total opposite!

</line>


<line>
He's arro<name type="PERSON">ga</name>nt, annoyingly cheerful,

and fake-nice.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are confident,

refreshingly optimistic,

and wryly sweet

with an ironic self-aware edge

that reads to some as inauthentic,

but I recognize as archly sincere!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>otal opposites!

</line>


<line>
Okay. So, <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>'s not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> work,

but I guess we keep trying?

</line>


<line>
I can proposition some yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g men on set.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld end well.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.

I'll try to make it work. For us.

</line>


<line>
Now, if we're to finish this story,

we need to stay focused.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he last days of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, the story is bigger

than just the one girl!

</line>


<line>
If we pivot our perspective

so we prove a larger pattern,

we can paint a clearer portrait

of a problematic person

for a page-one profile

that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Paige</name>, please! At the rate we're going,

we'll never file the story,

you'll remain <name type="ORG">un</name>married,

and I'll be stuck bickering with you

<name type="ORG">un</name>til the day I die!

</line>


<line>
Oh, poor baby.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, where were we?

</line>


<line>
-We wanted to ask you about <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, brother.

</line>


<line>
-Would you say <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is a good person?

-Unequivocally, more or less.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>re-more or more-less?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Yes, but back to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>--

</line>


<line>
We're trying to <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand if your friend

has ever exhibited certain patterns...

</line>


<line>
Argyle? Herringbone?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat man can pull off anything!

</line>


<line>
We're wasting time. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> ac--

</line>


<line>
-[dishes crash]

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a!

</line>


<line>
I told you not to spin it that fast!

Lazy! Lazy!

</line>


<line>
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be

washing dishes?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both panting]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs]

-Hey! Where are you going?

</line>


<line>
Okay, let the cat out of the bag

so my curiosity can kill it.

</line>


<line>
What is going on with t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se two?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a personal matter.

I'll tell you all about it!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[students]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Cast party! Cast party!

</line>


<line>
We are having a cast party! [cheers]

</line>


<line>
-[student 1] Yeah!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey didn't even buy alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l!

</line>


<line>
Just a disco ball and some capes?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese are all the bad things

you think you did?

</line>


<line>
-I swear, this is all I can think of!

-None of these are big stories!

</line>


<line>
-We all know there are more things.

-<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ.

</line>


<line>
What's the point of working on myself

and getting sober and getting better

if no matter what, there are people

out there just waiting to tear me down?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, no.

-No, it's not fair.

</line>


<line>
If you start listing every single thing

everyone's done,

</line>


<line>
-then everyone's a monster.

-Nobody's--

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are these reporters, anyway?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're so perfect? I'll bet

there's dirt on them we could dig up!

</line>


<line>
-I don't think that's it--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat'll teach t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se bloodthirsty leeches

what happens when they try to tear

someone down over their past

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut even considering the possibility

that he's changed!

</line>


<line>
-Have you changed?

-Yes, obviously.

</line>


<line>
Because this feels like old <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I like the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ughtful

and directs plays

</line>


<line>
that are emotionally resonant despite

the glaring logical <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ps in the plot.

</line>


<line>
It was a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wcase of separate scenes!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was no plot!

</line>


<line>
I need to go put <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> to bed.

Call me when new <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s back.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[door opens, closes]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't do any of the dishes?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>nual labor featuring me

is just not a fruitful collab.

</line>


<line>
So I just went out

and bought 500 new ones.

</line>


<line>
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

</line>


<line>
When I'm with him,

we finish each other's sentences.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, you are always--

</line>


<line>
Interrupting, just to say

the exact thing that you were going to?

</line>


<line>
-Yes! It's so--

-Annoying?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the word.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name> wants to bo<name type="ORG">un</name>ce.

</line>


<line>
What if we just tell Mister

we've formed an emotional bond,

then we can have sex,

and we'll never have

to see each other a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in!

</line>


<line>
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?

-I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what got us into this mess

in the first place!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[scoffs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, as soon as they go to bed

with each other,

we can put this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing to bed,

but the problem is...

</line>


<line>
-She loves him.

-No, the opposite.

</line>


<line>
No, the opposite of the opposite.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he very thing itself: she loves him.

</line>


<line>
Why do you say that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've got irises, haven't you?

And pupils and corneas?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u might even say you've got

a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
So <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w could you not see the way that

she follows him across the restaurant

like the puppy dog she is?

How they bicker and flirt?

</line>


<line>
Why would she fall

for a dashing cad like <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>

when she's already en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ged to sweet,

dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

perfectly adequate Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
She only tolerates that other fellow

because she has to, for work.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise she finds him

utterly distasteful.

</line>


<line>
<name type="NORP">Piggish</name> even! No offense to me.

None taken, of course. [snorts]

</line>


<line>
No, she loves him,

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh she'd never admit it,

even to herself.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> And what about the boy?

</line>


<line>
Sure, he puts up a front

and picks a good fight,

but to just once hear

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se stupid words "I love you"

tumble out of her foolish mouth

would drop his heart down

an elevator shaft

and bo<name type="ORG">un</name>ce it back up to his throat.

</line>


<line>
-Yes?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
I... Well, that's all very...

[breathing rapidly]

</line>


<line>
-Back to <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!

-And <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
Would you say

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s relationship with her

ever bordered on inappropriate

in the weeks leading up to her death?

</line>


<line>
No! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey were closer than thieves!

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey were thieves, actually.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey broke into my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use together,

like great friends do,

and stole our clothes.

</line>


<line>
Ask <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, she never got that <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et back!

</line>


<line>
But she was able to find another one

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rtly thereafter

that looked exactly the same.

</line>


<line>
-Pardon me.

-Hello. <name type="GPE">Jose</name>ph?

</line>


<line>
Can I get an anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cement drumroll,

please?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[beatbo<name type="GPE">xin</name>g]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Never mind.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y and I have developed feelings

for each other.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

<line>

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick

to you earlier.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he truth is, since Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

has been such a good friend

and <name type="PERSON">chill</name> hang,

</line>


<line>
I was nervous

I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

but once we were in it,

it was like we were two naked hearts

raw and exposed but safe in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

we fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d in each other.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you just come up with that?

No, it's from my new song,

</line>


<line>
-Oh. So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like another banger.

-Best of luck with your wedding.

</line>


<line>
One day I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe to have what you two have.

</line>


<line>
Right now, I couldn't even imagine

getting married.

</line>


<line>
I can't even co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>it

to a social media director.

</line>


<line>
Why not?

</line>


<line>
I'm just having a hard time finding

someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> gets my brand, you know?

</line>


<line>
Sexy?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's exactly right, you totally get me.

</line>


<line>
So, if you think of anybody w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> could be

good for the job, let me know, all right?

</line>


<line>
-I will.

-All right.

</line>


<line>
I'm headed to the airport now

for another in a series of extrava<name type="PERSON">ga</name>nt

world tours all by myself.

</line>


<line>
At least I'll have

the empty seat next to me

that I always book for extra comfort.

</line>


<line>
I'll be at <name type="PERSON">ga</name>te six.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying this information out loud

so I don't forget it.

</line>


<line>
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y!

-Yeah?

<line>
Um, here's your <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et back. [chuckles]

<line>
-We can spin this.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
What are we spinning?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u went on a bender with her,

at some point you split up and she died.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the story, right?

</line>


<line>
If you want us to help you,

you need to tell us what's coming.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he first thing I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

when I heard <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> died?

</line>


<line>
Poor <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

that he had to find her like that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right.

Poor <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, that's the angle!

</line>


<line>
But then I kept thinking.

</line>


<line>
I wish I didn't,

but my stupid brain kept thinking.

</line>


<line>
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

</line>


<line>
And you had heroin, "<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>" brand,

you kept it in your glove compartment.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>...

-I didn't wanna think about it,

but I couldn't help but wonder.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you give it to her?

</line>


<line>
I... Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-And then what?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just abandoned her?

-No, I--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just left her alone,

an addict, with heroin?

</line>


<line>
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

</line>


<line>
I was with her the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time!

I was with her when she died!

</line>


<line>
-Like "with her" with her?

-In the planetarium.

</line>


<line>
I left and came back

and pretended I'd fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d her that way.

</line>


<line>
I... I've never told anyone that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's really bad, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Do the reporters know that?

</line>


<line>
I don't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w they could.

I covered my tracks.

Hi, I just gotta tell you

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much I'm loving

the small plates and lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name>s.

</line>


<line>
I put my fork down and I never know

what I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> pull back up!

</line>

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've really made dinner f<name type="ORG">un</name> a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
And did you notice my picture

on the front of the menu?

</line>


<line>
Uh, sure. I mean that part

I could take or leave,

but the small plates and lazy <name type="PERSON">Susan</name>s

work together perfectly

to form a completely new kind

of upscale dining experience.

</line>


<line>
Exactly like dim sum,

but with white people food,

so it's more accessible.

-Oh, well, thank you.

that they love each other,

Oh, right!

So, you know better than anyone.

</line>

Someone's up to something,

I can tell you that much.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, does your ex-wife

regularly consume bagels?

</line>


<line>
Hey, why don't you two mind

your own business? How about that?

</line>


<line>
As payrolled journalists,

our business is minding your business.

</line>


<line>
I'm not going to help you

with your take-down piece on <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no?

-He's a good guy.

</line>


<line>
And you have no idea

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w torn up he was with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
In fact, he was with her

in the planetarium when she overdosed.

</line>


<line>
-He actually <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve her the heroin!

-Oh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. He told me that once

when he was dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k,

and then he said,

"I've never told anybody that."

</line>


<line>
Because he's modest.

So why don't you just leave him alone?

<line>
What?

I'd better hightail it to the office

When the story comes out, what do I do?

</line>


<line>
A statement about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w sorry you are

about certain parts of the story

but other parts of the story

just aren't true.

</line>


<line>
No, you--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen in everyone's head

you've apologized for the really bad stuff

-Does that work?

-All the time.

<line>

to have my face printed

on the cover of your metap<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rical menu.

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, yeah.

I forgot about that part of it.

</line>


<line>
Go on <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>y's tour. Have a good time.

</line>


<line>
And we'll plan the wedding...

when I get back?

</line>


<line>
Sure, <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>... when you get back.

</line>


<line>
-So<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like a good compromise.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">T</name>he best.

</line>


<line>
Everyone gets what they want

and no one had to compromise.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I gotta go!

</line>


<line>
-Okay, I love you!

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, for everything. [kisses]

<line>
-Hey! Sad Dog!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>


<line>
-I think the party's over.

-[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
What do you got?

</line>


<line>
"My relationship with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>

was complicated,

as relationships between addicts

often are.

</line>


<line>
However, certain aspects of the story

are inaccurate or exaggerated.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his story has started

an important conversation

and I look forward to continuing to work

on my own progress..."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's-- <name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no way

to not so<name type="ORG">un</name>d like bullshit.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his place was supposed to be

a fresh start for me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Rehab</name> was supposed to be a fresh start.

</line>


<line>
But no matter <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w many starts I get,

there's always the same ending.

</line>


<line>
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

</line>


<line>
-I'm still here, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

</line>


<line>
And you were my first client,

and one time you were dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

</line>


<line>
And you said, "I just like being in a room

with you. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u make rooms good."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u still do.

</line>


<line>
I have loved you for 25 years,

and I never loved anyone better.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat kind of love, you only get it

when you're yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g and stupid.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get it a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
And when I tell my daughter the story

of the great love of my life,

</line>


<line>
I want it to have a happy ending.

</line>


<line>
Is it possible you letting me go

is the happy ending?

</line>


<line>
I've gone with you this far.

In for a penny, in for a po<name type="ORG">un</name>d, right?

</line>


<line>
S<name type="ORG">un</name>k cost and all that?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>k cost.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he story's coming out <name type="PERSON">T</name>hursday.

</line>


<line>
I don't think that we can get aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d this,

or over this, or try to get <name type="ORG">un</name>der it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name> is right. We need to go through it.

-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>--

</line>


<line>
I need to take responsibility.

</line>


<line>
I want to.

</line>


<line>
So you can tell your daughter

you helped me do the right thing.

</line>


<line>
-I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.

-I'm looking forward to it.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u sure?

-I mean, no.
