  <title><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Judge - <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
So I send in the form,

and if my mom wants to meet me too,

</line>


<line>
-then we meet?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

then I get to feel that <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t sting

of rejection all over a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
What a f<name type="ORG">un</name> adventure this all is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what <ital>is </ital>f<name type="ORG">un</name>? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u coming with me

to my first day on my new s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

in <ital>F.H.B.A. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>s Angeles,</ital>

starring <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

as 'the Judge.'"

</line>


<line>
What is <ital>F.H.B.A.</ital>?

</line>


<line>
I think it's one of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ws

about <name type="ORG">Navy</name> sex crimes that have gone cold?

</line>


<line>
And there may be numbers or something?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen, they call "the Judge."

</line>


<line>
I'm just excited to get out of the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
I've been getting really fidgety

cooped up on that hill.

</line>


<line>
Like I got tiny little bumps

crawling aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

on the inside of my skin, you know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>otally. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at this guy,

texting in the middle of the inter<name type="ORG">sec</name>tion.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have been judged

to be a shitty driver.

</line>


<line>
I'm the Judge.

I sentence you to kiss my ass.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>om!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got "judged."

</line>


<line>
It feels good

to be a dramatic actor a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o make someone laugh

is a craft, to be sure,

but to make someone cry, on purpose,

that is a precious gift.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm <name type="PERSON">Miles</name>, the production intern.

Can I get you anything? Water?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's so sweet of you.

</line>


<line>
Actually, that's so his job of him.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, <name type="GPE">PA</name>, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se name I already forgot.

-It's <name type="PERSON">Miles</name>, and I'm an intern.

</line>


<line>
Still not interested. Can you take

my daughter to "video village"?

</line>


<line>
I wanna make sure she sees me

at my most awesome,

which is with a slightly high angle

to avoid appearance of a double chin.

</line>


<line>
Note to director.

-Right this way.

-Okay.

I tell kids in the cancer ward.

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, do you have anything

you'd like to say to the contestants

before we give our verdict?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm good.

</line>


<line>
Very well.

Calliope, you are "ready for this jelly."

Cover up your bottom and go.

No!

It was supposed to be

<ital>Felicity <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>ffman's</ital>

<ital>Future Leaders of <name type="GPE">America</name>,</ital>

but it got retooled a little

by the network.

</line>


<line>
So are we judging w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> has the best booty?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, no.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is so degrading.

</line>


<line>
So if it's not about their butts,

then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>t?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm an <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest and impartial judge.

</line>


<line>
And if there's one thing I'm famous for,

it's that I cannot lie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.

</line>


<line>
Hey, can we go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me now?

</line>


<line>
Being aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d all these skinny L.A. ladies

makes me feel like a blob.

</line>


<line>
Well, I gotta s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot

for, like, ten more <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

</line>


<line>
Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
Apparently, it takes three <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs to set up

the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."

</line>


<line>
So making <name type="PERSON">T</name>V is like a full-time job?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen why is it so bad?

</line>


<line>
I just assumed people weren't trying.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,

but s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't your daughter be in sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol?

<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't you be

"Sir Minding-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur-Own-Business-A-<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>t"?

I graduated early and took a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>p year.

<line>
My friend <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ryssa is backpacking

through <name type="LOC">Europe</name>,

but lucky me, I get to hang out

in this butt-infested ware<name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Oh. All right.

</line>


<line>
Someone better be checking

the pH levels of that Jacuzzi

because these bitches are basic.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey got a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le area that was built

you are going to love <name type="PERSON">Stilton</name> Acres.

</line>


<line>
We have a sa<name type="ORG">un</name>a and a tennis court

and a giant hedge maze.

</line>


<line>
And if you make it all the way through

the maze, you get some su<name type="PERSON">ga</name>r water.

</line>


<line>
And you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> love

the Feast of Saint Squeaky.

</line>


<line>
It's the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>liest of all mouse <name type="PERSON">ho</name>lidays.

</line>


<line>
We prepare a feast of <name type="NORP">Swiss</name>--

</line>


<line>
Because it's the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>liest of all cheeses?

</line>


<line>
Because it was all our ancestors

could carry

when they were trying to escape

for their lives.

</line>


<line>
Oh-- because it has <ital><name type="PERSON">ho</name>les!</ital>

to tell them about, you know, <name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.

-I'm dropping out of the race.

-What?!

<name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>'s a better leader

than I'll ever be.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his election is about bigger things

than just you and <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>.

</line>


<line>
What is it about then?

</line>


<line>
It's about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe, and freedom,

and powerful lobbyists

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> pay me to elect

a governor I can control

so we can get legislation passed

that allows them to build private prisons

on what are now protected wetlands.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pefully t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se evil lobbyists

can find some other puppet

Why would you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe that?

I'm done r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning for governor,

so you're fired.

-Oh. No, thank you.

<line>
-Wine?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's all right.

</line>


<line>
I will consider it a personal affront

if you won't at least have a beer.

</line>


<line>
-I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't.

-What about a very caffeinated coffee?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Raw shellfish?

<line>
-Not tonight.

-Ci<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rette?

</line>


<line>
-I don't smoke.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's okay.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can just stand aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d me

while I smoke.

</line>


<line>
No, I don't want to.

</line>


<line>
Cocaine, then?

</line>


<line>
I so appreciate that,

and I hate to be rude,

but I really don't think it's a good idea.

</line>


<line>
Would you like me to p<name type="ORG">un</name>ch you

in the belly real quick

so you remember

what it's like to be alive?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a rich person thing.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know.

I grew up aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d rich people.

</line>


<line>
But I'm actually good,

as far as belly-p<name type="ORG">un</name>chings go.

</line>


<line>
Well, can I at least offer you a ride

on our private rollercoaster?

</line>


<line>
Surely, there's no reason

you wouldn't want to do that.

</line>


<line>
-So if you decline, I will be offended.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Also, not that it's relevant,

but the rollercoaster

is specifically discouraged

for children <name type="ORG">un</name>der five

and pregnant women.

</line>


<line>
But since you are neither of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se,

obviously, there's no reason

you will not want to ride

on our family's really f<name type="ORG">un</name> rollercoaster.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, look, the truth is--

-Hey, <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn

one of your great golf stories?

</line>


<line>
-Say, there's an idea.

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">California</name>ns, this is an endorsement!

</line>


<line>
My message is simple.

</line>


<line>
If you want to vote <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

vote <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>

because a vote for <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>

is a vote for <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Uh--

</line>


<line>
Since <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter

likes <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>.

</line>


<line>
So if you like <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>,

vote like Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter...

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me--

-...for <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name> <name type="ORG">Coodchuck-Berkowitz</name>.

</line>


<line>
So if we want to vote for <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>,

we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld vote for you?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-By voting for <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
I look forward to moving past

the political divisiveness

of this campaign

and <ital>finally </ital>focusing on the issues.

<line>
What's with the gorilla feet?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<line>
As I've explained before,

my hands were crushed

during the fracking incident.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here were no hand transplants

readily available,

but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.

</line>


<line>
So I am using them temporarily

while my doctors

find me more suitable replacements.

<line>

for dropping out of the race.

<line>
Rest assured, <name type="ORG">un</name>der my stewardship,

the state will be in good--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> say "hands," weren't you?

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
So, what's next for us two amigos?

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

we don't need your help on the campaign.

</line>


<line>
We are r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning virtually <name type="ORG">un</name>opposed.

I think our team can handle it from here.

</line>


<line>
Wha-wha-wha-what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he best way you can help us

is to go back to your regular life

and stay out of politics forever.

</line>


<line>
So this chapter of my life is over?

<name type="PERSON">Doggy</name>, doggy. What now?

</line>


<line>
Coochy-coochy-coochy...

any gentleman callers today?

from <name type="PERSON">Corbin</name> <name type="ORG">Creamerman</name>.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what? I'll check.

-S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't you be doing pushups?

Nope, can't. Impossible.

to get <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd to stop coming up

with awful ideas.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a pretense

to get you to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w up.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It was <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's idea.

</line>


<line>
What else you got, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

</line>


<line>
Well, I got this one thing.

I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u bite your tongue.

-Yes, bite it all the way off!

</line>


<line>
All your ideas are beyond terrible.

"terrible" business instincts.

<line>
Okay, so you know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard it is

</line>


<line>
-to get your kids to go to the dentist?

-I don't.

</line>


<line>
But what if dentists

had a friendlier face?

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
What if you could take your kids

to a dentist's office

where all the dentists were clowns?

</line>


<line>
-What?!

-Kids love clowns!

</line>


<line>
-Do kids love clowns?

-Actually--

</line>


<line>
Don't they?

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> else would clowns be for?

</line>


<line>
Because adults don't love clowns.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is true.

Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

</line>


<line>
So kids <ital>must </ital>love clowns,

because otherwise,

why would there be clowns?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is so<name type="ORG">un</name>d logic. Okay.

</line>


<line>
I want these clown dentists

laughing maniacally

as they drill into the teeth

of <name type="GPE">America</name>'s children, starting yesterday!

</line>


<line>
As someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> <ital>does </ital>have children,

I have to say,

a lot of kids

are actually <ital>terrified </ital>of clowns!

</line>


<line>
Are they? Hm.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat would have been helpful information

before I co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>itted.

</line>


<line>
But my word is my bond

and I already said yes, didn't I?

</line>


<line>
Okay, so do we find dentists

and train them to be clowns,

or do we get clowns

and train them to be dentists?

</line>


<line>
Why don't we get clowns and dentists

and they can train each other?

Well, you're the one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> said you were a blob.

-Do you think I'm a blob?

-No.

</line>


<line>
What kind of person

calls his own daughter a blob?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said "blob."

And that's the kind of person

that I want to spend my time with.

</line>


<line>
I get it! It's my weight!

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey don't hate cats.

to tell your family about the baby.

But they'll come aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're my family.

<line>
Can't believe she's still pissed.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't have called her a "blob."

</line>


<line>
I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

</line>


<line>
How about just as a general rule,

don't ever call a woman a blob?

</line>


<line>
Never! What if I meet a woman

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se name is Barbara <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>b?

</line>


<line>
And I call her "B" for s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt. "B. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>b."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe instead of figuring out

the woman blob workaro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,

you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld just tell <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck

you're sorry.

</line>


<line>
I still think <name type="PERSON">Miles</name> is up to something.

</line>


<line>
Why is it so hard for you to believe

someone could genuinely

like your daughter?

</line>


<line>
Because she's like me!

</line>


<line>
Okay. Do you think maybe this could be

more about <ital>you </ital>than it is about her?

</line>


<line>
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work

to do on myself. Everyone knows that.

</line>


<line>
But the important thing right now

is <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w I can fix things with <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ry to stay on topic, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Well, an open conversation

about your concerns with--

</line>


<line>
No, that's too <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane-y.

She'd never buy it was coming from me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen why do you want my advice?

</line>


<line>
I got it. If I can some<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w prove to her

what a jerk <name type="PERSON">Miles</name> is,

then she'll have to like me more

by default.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> way.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, no--!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goldie</name>, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w would you like

to advance to the final ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

</line>


<line>
I would do anything, and I mean, anything.

</line>


<line>
-So I did it. I had sex with the <name type="GPE">PA</name>.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with him?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what you wanted, right?

</line>


<line>
I just said "seduce" the <name type="GPE">PA</name>.

</line>


<line>
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?

</line>


<line>
No, I just wanted you to,

like, get him all <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t and bothered.

</line>


<line>
-Eh...?

-And <ital>ready </ital>to sleep with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen once you get him on audiotape

</line>


<line>
-saying that he would sleep with you...

-What?

</line>


<line>
...come up with some excuse to get

out of there with virtue intact.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a lot of specifics

you just assumed I would know.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, the important thing is,

we got him now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell <name type="PERSON">Miles</name> what you told me.

</line>


<line>
-I had sex with the <name type="GPE">PA</name>.

-What <name type="GPE">PA</name>?

</line>


<line>
I think his name was "Eggberg"?

</line>


<line>
-What? Not him?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the intern.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said "<name type="GPE">PA</name>."

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you think I was a <name type="GPE">PA</name>? Nice!

</line>


<line>
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?

</line>


<line>
Not sleep with.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told a contestant

you would advance her to the final ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

if she slept with a <name type="GPE">PA</name>?

</line>


<line>
I said "seduce." <name type="PERSON">T</name>here is a distinction.

</line>


<line>
We make a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w about empowering women

and lifting them up,

and you cheapen it

with this coarse vul<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rity.

</line>


<line>
I cannot lie. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u disgust me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his was all a big mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstanding.

you could have told me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe we could've worked out

some sort of deal.

</line>


<line>
What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
All right, so I got this screenplay,

and I think it's a really fresh area.

</line>


<line>
It's about a production intern

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wants to be a writer.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow.

</line>


<line>
I think it could go somewhere

if it got in front of the right person.

</line>


<line>
So if you have like an agent

or a manager you could give it to,

that would be awesome,

and I would never talk to <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

<line>

</line>


<line>
So you were right. He <ital>was </ital>a dirtbag.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I was kinda <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping

I was wrong for once.

</line>


<line>
If it makes you feel any better,

you were wrong

about all the other parts of this.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, you are so bad

at making people feel better.

</line>


<line>
Are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck?

</line>


<line>
She's a smart girl.

She'll figure it out eventually.

</line>


<line>
But for now, if she believes someone

can love her for w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> she really is,

then why would I take that

away from her?

Half of them are clown dentists.

Just try to ignore them

and go about your business.

-Okay.

-So, this is the incisor.

<name type="PERSON">Doc</name>, if this is what's incisor,

Of course,

Well, there's no way

they could beat <name type="PERSON">Woodchuck</name>, right?

No? Because I almost beat him

and I don't even know

what a governor does.

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, you've got to help.

He's right. <name type="GPE">California</name> loves making

No.

I was just jealous because you were
