<line>
And he says-- he says,

"Why the long face?"

</line>


<line>
And I say, "Hey, buddy,

I can't help it."

</line>


<line>
You get that? Long face.

Horses have long faces.

</line>


<line>
I am a horse, my face is long.

You get it, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dispassionate murmur]</nonVerbComm>

Good, good.

</line>


<line>
What about

the Rock Hudson stuff?

</line>


<line>
Felt like that flew

over your heads.

</line>


<line>
Did you get that?

</line>


<line>
Keep this up, and the only

thing we're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get

is our money back!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay,

it wasn't that funny.

</line>

Maybe you didn't get it.

Hey, let me

buy you a drink.

Get cancer, jerk wad.

</line>

You've got some good material,

you really do.

</line>


<line>
The <name type="PERSON">Gorbachev</name> stuff,

it's killer.

</line>


<line>
But you gotta stop asking people

if they get things.

</line>


<line>
But then w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> do I know

if they got it?

</line>


<line>
They'll laugh.

</line>


<line>
Why are you giving me

advice?

</line>


<line>
Look, I've been doing stand-up

for a year now,

and it's the responsibility

of big shots like me

to always be looking out

for the little guy.

</line>


<line>
Let me buy you a drink.

Oh, I don't drink.

<line>
Goddamn it, Todd,

clean up your shit.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do,

okay?

</line>


<line>
You don't give me

any closet space.

</line>


<line>
Not my problem.

A better man than you

Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

settle a bet.

</line>


<line>
Are you a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name> or a Zelda?

</line>


<line>
Don't know what that means.

</line>


<line>
Well, I was talking

to <name type="PERSON">Wayne</name>.

</line>


<line>
- W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Wayne</name>?

<ital><name type="ORG">BuzzFeed</name>?</ital>

What'll they think of next?

</line>

F<name type="ORG">un</name> fact: <name type="PERSON">Wayne</name> is also

my ex-boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
Ha! You're funny.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> Pretty cool, eh, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>'s writing a book

about you,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wayne</name>'s writing

an article about me.

</line>


<line>
We're the same!

</line>


<line>
How could you think that

that's the same?

</line>


<line>
My book will be in libraries

for hundreds of years.

</line>


<line>
Your <ital><name type="ORG">BuzzFeed</name></ital> article

will be crammed

</line>


<line>
between an animated <name type="PERSON">GIF</name>

of a cat falling asleep

</line>


<line>
and a list of f<name type="ORG">un</name> facts

about <ital>Legally Blonde.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ha! Classic <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

</line>


<line>
I still don't know

what that means.

</line>


<line>
Well, are you familiar

with <ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's <name type="ORG">House</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do you mean his sitcom

that coincidentally

</line>


<line>
had the exact same premise

as my sitcom?

</line>


<line>
Not the exact same.

<ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's <name type="ORG">House</name> </ital>

featured a pair of twins,

<name type="PERSON">Zoe</name> and Zelda.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Zelda was the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>ny,</ital>

<ital>f<name type="ORG">un</name>-loving extrovert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Look at my pumpkin,

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Pretty smile, <name type="PERSON">Zelly</name>-belly.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience]</nonVerbComm> Aww...

</line>


<line>
<ital>Whereas <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name> was the smart,</ital>

<ital>cynical introvert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
My pumpkin's throwing up

because Halloween

encourages excessive consumption

of refined sugar

at a time when obesity rates

are sky high.

</line>


<line>
Plus, Halloween costumes are

a gateway to casual racism.

</line>


<line>
Why don't I keep the knife,

Zo-bo?

<line>
Now, was the show's acting

ham-fisted

and the writing moronic?

</line>


<line>
N-n-no?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but the <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>/Zelda

paradigm rang true.

</line>


<line>
I believe everyone's

either a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name> or a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
For example, <name type="PERSON">Nixon</name> was a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>

and <name type="PERSON">Kennedy</name>, a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Al Gore</name>, <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

<name type="PERSON">George W. Bush</name>, total Zelda.

</line>


<line>
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,

<name type="PERSON">Zooey</name> and <name type="PERSON">Emily</name> Deschanel.

</line>


<line>
So <name type="PERSON">Zooey</name>'s a <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Zooey</name>'s a Zelda.

<name type="PERSON">Emily</name>'s the <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

</line>


<line>
What a crazy world.

</line>


<line>
So which one are you,

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
I think I'm...

above this.

</line>


<line>
Said the <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe you're

the third kind of person,

</line>


<line>
whose only function is to drain

the energy and life force

from his host organism.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Nah, he's right.

I'm pretty much worthless.

</line>


<line>
See? You say something

to someone enough times,

</line>


<line>
and eventually,

he internalizes it.

</line>


<line>
The system works.

</line>


<line>
I don't have a job,

I don't have any prospects.

</line>


<line>
I probably won't ever finish

the rock opera I'm working on.

</line>


<line>
What?

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Since when are you

working on a rock opera?

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

Why'd I ask that?

</line>


<line>
Basically, it's <ital>Tommy</ital>

by way of <ital>Cirque du Soleil</ital>

set in space,

with heavy erotic overtones,

and the gripping psychodrama

of a thriller

with plenty of heart

and more than a little humor.

</line>


<line>
I call it

<ital><name type="ORG">Newtopia</name> Rising, Book I:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Search for a New Utopia.</ital>

Book I?

You've got me

thinking sequel here.

Ugh.

I don't know

<line>
Well, guess I'll give up

forever.

</line>


<line>
That's the spirit.

</line>


<line>
Now, you have to understand

that as a port city,

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Liverpool</name> had unique access to

all aspects of American culture,

especially Blues music and its

unruly nephew, <name type="ORG">Rock and Roll</name>.

</line>


<line>
I thought this story was about

running into Paul <name type="PERSON">McCartney</name>

in the bathroom

at the Golden Globes.

</line>


<line>
It is. I thought you would

appreciate some context.

</line>


<line>
Let's skip that one

for a minute.

</line>


<line>
Tell me about Todd.

</line>


<line>
Todd?

What's to tell?

</line>


<line>
Five years ago, he found his way

into one of my house parties

and never left.

</line>


<line>
And you've never asked him

anything about himself?

</line>


<line>
I've asked him to get a job,

I've asked him to move out.

</line>


<line>
With a little encouragement,

</line>


<line>
I'll bet he could

really flourish.

</line>


<line>
I mean, didn't you have anyone

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> helped you

when you were just

starting out?

</line>


<line>
Um, actually, no.

</line>


<line>
Todd clearly thinks

the world of you.

</line>


<line>
Todd thinks the world

of <name type="ORG">Pop-Tarts</name>.

</line>


<line>
Look, I get that helping other

people is not your thing, but--

</line>


<line>
What? I let Todd live

rent-free in my stately manse.

</line>


<line>
I am his own personal

Mother Teresa.

</line>


<line>
But do you let him stay here

because you're kind

or just because you're terrified

of being alone?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

That is insane!

</line>


<line>
I would love to be alone.

That is all I want.

</line>


<line>
Mmm...if that were

really true,

</line>


<line>
I don't think you'd be clipping

Todd's wings all the time.

</line>


<line>
What? That's unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
Todd!

</line>


<line>
What?

Clean up my shit?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but also,

I would like to...

help you with your

dumb-ass rock opera.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- I am... supporting you.

</line>


<line>
I-I don't understand.

Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, are you dying?

</line>


<line>
No. I... think you have great

depth of untapped potential

and I wish to mentor you

in your... art.

</line>


<line>
- Really?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is this going to be

like that time

you promised to take me

ice skating,

and I got really excited

about the ice skating,

but then instead of ice skating,

you left me at home

so you could go

to the strip club

and then you took the strippers

ice skating?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- Then hooray!

</line>


<line>
Let's dig in.

Where to start?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, the headline is,

I hate it.

</line>


<line>
I hate everything about it.

</line>


<line>
The premise is bad

and the execution is also bad.

</line>


<line>
It's an irredeemable jumble

of shit.

</line>


<line>
Tough but fair.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>.

</line>


<line>
That said,

I don't see why

we can't make something

really great here.

</line>


<line>
Okay, thank you.

I'll work on that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

Are you close?

</line>


<line>
No!

</line>


<line>

- No!

</line>


<line>
Now?

</line>


<line>
You're not even

inside of me.

<nonVerbComm>[door opening]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you know

in the second act closer

when the seekers of <name type="ORG">Newtopia</name>

are in the Turbidians' dungeon

and they learn their ship

</line>


<line>
- has been destroyed?

- No.

</line>


<line>
Well, what if we move that

to the fourth act?

</line>


<line>
I have no idea

what you're talking about,

but that idea is terrible.

</line>


<line>
I hear the note.

Let me see what I can do.

</line>


<line>
I would rather that happened

than your rock opera.

</line>


<line>
That's not really a note.

</line>


<line>
In fact, none of your notes

have been notes.

</line>


<line>
I feel like you're

not even listening.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, you know what?

Maybe I would listen

if the Turbidians

had some reason

to enter

the Cave of Swollen Dreams

that didn't break the pact

they made in act one

with Queen <name type="PERSON">Darneesa</name>.

</line>


<line>
You have been listening.

</line>


<line>
Just doesn't make sense.

</line>


<line>
The Turbidians

are a loyal people.

</line>


<line>
They-- they wouldn't

betray their queen.

</line>


<line>
Unless...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> They were working

for Queen <name type="PERSON">Darneesa</name>,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> gave them a potion

that would counteract

the effects of

<name type="ORG">the Elixir of Failed Remembrance</name>

so they could bring

the secret knowledge

from the cave back to her,

and then establish <name type="ORG">Newtopia</name>

as a vassal state

to the Craterman kingdom!

Wait, you want

to get lunch with me?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's right.

</line>


<line>
Is this like the time

you invited me to lunch,

but then, when I got

to the restaurant,

you texted me to tell me

you weren't coming

because you were at a strip club

"eating stripper" for lunch,

and also,

it was my birthday?

</line>


<line>
No.

<line>

I worked with <name type="PERSON">David</name> O. Russell.

<line>
So how long have you been

dating Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Is it serious?

I'm only asking for the article.

Better question:

How long does it take

It's "burritos as big as your head" day

</line>


<line>

I thought we were going to see

the <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> <name type="ORG">Arbus</name> show

at LACMA today.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

Her name is <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>,

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I've actually been meaning

to go myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, you guys

are perfect for each other.

</line>


<line>
Why did you ever break up?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[nervous laugh]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
Okay, less yakking,

more snacking.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Here's your steak.

</line>


<line>
- Uh, sorry.

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
You mean to tell me

that for a full year

you were on the r<name type="ORG">un</name>

from the Russian mafia?

</line>


<line>
Well,<ital> </ital>a Russian mafia.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe you never

told me any of this stuff.

</line>


<line>
I just thought you were

a dumb freeloader

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> ate all my food

and played video games all day.

</line>


<line>
You should have seen me

in high school.

</line>


<line>
There was this one game,

Decapathon.

</line>


<line>
I remember that game.

</line>


<line>
I was up for Dr. <name type="PERSON">Decapitator</name>

in the movie version.

</line>


<line>
They said they wanted

someone hipper,

going to <name type="PERSON">Ro<name type="PERSON">bert</name> Downey</name>.

<line>
- Junior?

- If it was Junior,

</line>


<line>
I would have said, "Junior."

</line>


<line>
That game basically

destroyed my life.

</line>


<line>
I flunked out of school,

my girlfriend left me.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

I didn't stop playing

until my mom

threw me out of the house.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's when

I first realized, you know,

</line>


<line>
I'm a total screw-up.

</line>


<line>
You're not a screw-up

anymore, Todd.

</line>


<line>
You're about to have

a hit rock opera on your hands.

</line>


<line>
I'm really glad

you think that.

</line>


<line>
I got Princess Carolyn

to invite

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Virgil</name> <name type="PERSON">Van Cleef</name>

to our next rehearsal.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> in the what Van?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Virgil</name> <name type="PERSON">Van Cleef</name> is

the biggest name in rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Okay, think of all

the great rock operas

from the last 20 years.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
He had a piece of all of them.

</line>


<line>
Wow, Todd, are you sure

we're ready for that?

</line>


<line>
Hey, you said yourself

the train is moving,

but if you think

we're not ready,

</line>


<line>
I mean, I'll listen to you.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you've done

enough listening, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's about time

I start listening.

</line>


<line>
Well, I feel like--

[phone ringing]

</line>


<line>
Gotta take this.

Hello?

</line>

Hello?

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> <name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>?

We have some very delicate

<line>
I am very happy

with my current

long distance provider,

thank you.

<line>
Now, if you'll excuse me,

I'm having lunch with my friend.

<ital>But if you just listen--</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right, gang, when <name type="PERSON">Virgil</name> Van

Cleef gets here, look alive.

</line>


<line>
This could be Todd's big break,

so clap really hard

and laugh at all the jokes,

even if they're not funny,

but also, be careful,

because a lot of things

you might think are jokes

are not jokes,

so, you know, look out.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
- That was not a joke.

- That was not a real laugh.

What you're about to see

is rough, very rough.

It's a vomit pass at what

might become a rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Right now, it's set

mostly in space,

but we're not married

to that.

</line>


<line>
Todd is neither a singer

nor a trained musician.

</line>


<line>
In fact, he never even

graduated high school,

he told me in confidence.

</line>


<line>
Keep all that in mind

as you give it up for Todd.

Six weeks? Uh, damn.

Yeah, I guess so.

Marvelous! We'll schedule

an investor showcase posthaste.

In the meantime, libations!

</line>


<line>
Ah!

[laughter]

</line>


<line>
- Popping, what?

- This is great.

</line>


<line>
You know, just when you think

you have a person pegged,

he can still find ways

to surprise you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Todd really rose

to the occasion, didn't he?

</line>


<line>
I was talking about you.

</line>


<line>
Ah, well,

it was nothing.

</line>


<line>
Maybe the <name type="PERSON">Zoe</name> has

a little Zelda in him after all.

</line>


<line>
I appreciate the sentiment,

but I still think

that game is stupid.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, do you realize

what this means?

</line>


<line>
I mean, if this thing's a hit,

I could finally move out.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh,

you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> move out?

</line>


<line>
You won't have to yell,

"Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"

</line>


<line>
Or, "Todd, why haven't you

cleaned up your shit yet?"

</line>


<line>
Or, "Todd, what was the name of

that guy from <ital>Perfect Strangers?</ital>

</line>


<line>
This is all just

happening so fast.

<line>
I don't-- I don't think

Todd is ready for this.

</line>


<line>
Todd's not ready

or you're not ready?

</line>


<line>
Don't make this about me.

I've seen what happens

when baby birds get pushed

out of the nest too soon.

</line>


<line>
It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
I thought he was ready.

He seemed ready.

</line>


<line>
It's not... your... fault.

</line>


<line>
You're right.

In these heady times,

what Todd needs is an agent.

Ha! Ha!

</line>


<line>
- I just need you to deliver...

- Hoo! Ha!

</line>


<line>
- That third act showstopper...

- Ha!

</line>


<line>
...and then we'll be

fully financed!

</line>

Todd can do it!

Todd can do anything!

And another autograph,

here, and here.

might be a big anthem that--

Is this really

only a dime?

</line>


<line>
If it's in there,

that's the price.

</line>


<line>
Todd, this is no time

for a relapse.

</line>


<line>
Look, okay, I'll buy it now,

but I won't play it

till after I've written

the new song.

</line>


<line>
Todd, this is a bad idea!

</line>


<line>
- Whoa!

- All sales are final.

Okay, let's see here.

or the larger world

but you know what?

He's a good friend.

</line>


<line>
I don't see

how that's relevant.

</line>


<line>
No, of course you don't.

Maybe Todd's worse off today,

but you're worse off
