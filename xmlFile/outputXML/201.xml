<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Dick</name> on TV]</nonVerbComm> <ital>This is from <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> H.</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is nine years old.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"When I grow up, I want to be like you.</ital>

<ital>I'm on the right track.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Get it? Track? Because horses</ital>

<ital>run on tracks and you are a horse.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I am a horse. Do you get it?</ital>

<ital>Do you get my joke about the track?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>- There's a whole page of this.</ital>

<ital>- Should I write him, tell him I get it?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Dick</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>He goes on. "My question for you is:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I am a good kid and I like to play,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and I like to go to school,</ital>

<ital>but sometimes I get sad.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What do you do when you get sad?</ital>

<ital>How do you not be sad?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mother]</nonVerbComm> Oh, big stud, running off

to gallivant with your fillies.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[plate smashes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[father]</nonVerbComm> Is that to impress me?

I can smash a dinner plate, too.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mother]</nonVerbComm> That's a salad plate.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[father]</nonVerbComm>

I thought these were salad plates.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mother]</nonVerbComm> Those are saucers.

[father] Why do we even have saucers?

</line>


<line>
We don't drink tea.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mother]</nonVerbComm>

Those saucers are for entertaining!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[father]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, yeah? Well, I'm exit-taining.

</line>


<line>
Do you get it?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[door slams]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But, uh, seriously, folks.</ital>

<ital>[chuckles] Right?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mother groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Don't sit so close to the TV,

it'll make you cruel.

</line>


<line>
You know, I was beautiful

</line>


<line>
- before I got pregnant.

- I know.

</line>


<line>
- You ruined me, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

- I know.

</line>


<line>
You better grow up to be something great

to make up for all the damage you've done.

</line>


<line>
I will.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on TV]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>...and I just kept running. <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>...</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay, enough me being a great mom.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go hide

your father's heart medication.

</line>


<line>
Enjoy your dumb little TV show.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on recording]</nonVerbComm><ital> The first thing is,</ital>

<ital>you gotta believe that change is possible.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You have to tell yourself every day:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"I can change and I will change."</ital>

</line>


<line>
- I can change and I will change.

- [man on recording]<ital> Louder.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I can change and I will change.

</line>


<line>
- [man on recording] <ital>Still can't hear you.</ital>

- You're an audiobook.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on recording]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>"I've got a new attitude."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's what your face should be saying</ital>

<ital>to everyone you pass on the street.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>We call that the PANTS approach.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>P-A-N-T-S.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>People all need to see.</ital>

</line>


<line>
People all need to see.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, a little to the right.

No, house right.

</line>


<line>
That's an acting term.

It means left. I'm an actor.

<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, why did I wake up in an alley?

- I had to get rid of the old couch, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

</line>


<line>
While I was sleeping on it?

</line>


<line>
The couch was a metaphor

for my old attitude.

</line>


<line>
My audiobook told me I had to let go

of the burdens of my life sofa.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know what?

Maybe it was "my life so far."

</line>


<line>
I feel like

you could've woken me up first.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, no one can wake anybody else up.

You need to wake yourself up.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I trust this new guy.

I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

</line>


<line>
- Uh-oh. I think someone needs a FAB.

- A FAB?

</line>


<line>
FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

</line>


<line>
- BNA?

- Brand-new attitude. Try to keep up.

</line>


<line>
ATTITUDE stands for attention to--

</line>


<line>
Did you also get rid of my stuff?

Where's my duffel bag?

</line>


<line>
I value you.

Hashtag "thank you for being a friend."

</line>


<line>
Hashtag "PANTS."

<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on recording]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>You got to conquer that hill.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The hill is a metaphor.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Everything is a metaphor.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>- You are literally a metaphor.</ital>

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, this is the worst.

</line>


<line>
This feels awful.

</line>


<line>
Why does anybody run?

</line>


<line>
On your right.

</line>


<line>
And she had no idea

that her boyfriend was the strangler.

</line>


<line>
I guess some people just see what

they wanna see, right, <name type="PERSON">Vincent</name>?

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
- Yeah.

- Hey, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
I gotta go.

One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

</line>


<line>
Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.

I jog now.

</line>


<line>
You jogged here from <name type="PERSON">Laurel</name> Canyon?

</line>


<line>
I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch,

so the <name type="ORG">Fitbit</name> counted the miles.

</line>


<line>
Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman

is here?

</line>


<line>
- Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>.

- Also, your coffee is coming late.

</line>


<line>
- Just like you ordered.

- I said "latte."

</line>


<line>
Ah. Well, I wrote down "late,"

so that's what it's gonna be.

</line>


<line>
- What happened to <name type="PERSON">Laura</name>?

- Assistants are like <name type="PERSON">Belushi</name> brothers.

</line>


<line>
Good ones leave too soon,

bad ones never go away.

</line>


<line>
It's a beautiful day, though, right?

Every morning is a miracle.

</line>


<line>
Hashtag "miracle."

Hashtag "every morning."

</line>


<line>
Hashtag "every morning is a miracle."

Hashtag "<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> thoughts."

</line>


<line>
I'm glad you found your bliss, but are you

ready for your first day on set tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
You mean, am I amped?

Because I am so pumped.

</line>


<line>
This <ital>Secretariat </ital>movie is a big deal.

</line>


<line>
Please do not blow it.

</line>


<line>
Why would I blow it?

I have a brand-new attitude.

</line>


<line>
You know, when I won that Golden <name type="ORG">Globe</name>

last month, I went to a very dark place.

</line>


<line>
I was in a hole.

</line>


<line>
And I realized, "I can wallow

in this hole or I can change."

</line>


<line>
While I was tempted to go with the former,

sometimes the only way out of a hole

is a latter.

</line>


<line>
- No pun intended.

- You clearly intended that pun.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
- Uh-uh. I'm not asking.

- The awesome healing power--

</line>


<line>
- I am not asking.

- --of total positive energy.

</line>


<line>
You should leave because

I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.

</line>


<line>
Hello? [chuckles]

No, he's still here.

</line>


<line>
- No, he's not taking the hint somehow.

- Mm-hm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm>

Honey, where's my bandana?

</line>


<line>
You chewed it up,

we had to throw it away, remember?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> No, not that one.

</line>


<line>
The one with the bones on it.

</line>


<line>
With the meat juice stains?

The one I wore to the Emmys.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I gotta go.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s gonna be here any minute.

</line>


<line>
Did you check the hall closet?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm>

I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

</line>


<line>
I know, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
But you gotta keep it on

for one more week.

</line>


<line>
- [thudding]

- [Mr. Peanutbutter grunting]

</line>


<line>
I look like an idiot.

</line>


<line>
You look very responsible.

</line>


<line>
Is the bandana doing anything?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, work buddy,

first day on the job, huh?

</line>


<line>
Hashtag "great day to start fresh

at a new job, sincerely, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>."

</line>


<line>
- @<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

- Can't believe you wanted to carpool.

</line>


<line>
- Gotta save the planet, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

- Hey, is that <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>?

</line>


<line>
I don't know because I have no peripheral

vision. Going off of smell here.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

</line>


<line>
- Loving it, buddy. Loving life.

- Brother, I am right there with you.

</line>


<line>
I got a brand-new attitude

and I am also loving life.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, look at us.

A couple life-lovers over here.

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

</line>


<line>
It is a new cone.

Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?

</line>


<line>
Didn't notice.

You've got the smile of a winner.

</line>


<line>
- What's going on?

- I have to wear the cone

so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had

to get when I punched a mirror last week.

</line>


<line>
I got drunk and thought my reflection

was another dog. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I was so mad at that other dog.

</line>


<line>
He was wearing my clothes.

</line>


<line>
- We've all been there.

- I don't understand what's happening.

</line>


<line>
Did someone say something to the left?

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, is that you?

</line>


<line>
Hey, why don't we just us two schedj

a hang for this 'kend?

</line>


<line>
"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix

to the 'Stones show this 'kend.

</line>


<line>
- Wanna go?

- The Rolling Stones?

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, no, no, no.

<name type="ORG">The Mighty Mighty Bosstones</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not really familiar with that outfit,

but I do love trying new things.

</line>


<line>
- Who are you?

- Anyway, we gotta get to work.

</line>


<line>
It was really great talking to you,

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
All right, break a leg, good buddy.

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s ready to go.

</line>


<line>
Where are you, sweetheart?

Are you ready?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on recording]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>The house is a metaphor for a home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Happiness is a metaphor for change.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Happiness is a metaphor--

</line>


<line>
- Where are we going?

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, this is <name type="ORG">Corduroy</name>

<name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>-<name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>, your costar.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, man.

- <name type="ORG">Corduroy</name> <name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>-<name type="PERSON">Jackson</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right, the underwear guy.

</line>


<line>
Underwear model/actor/dancer/dreamer.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Also, you know, I'm a huge fan.

I'm so excited/amped/pumped

to be working with you.

[chuckles] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Hey, man, that's

fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

</line>


<line>
- Hi. <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> Jannings?

- That depends.

</line>


<line>
- Are you my ex-wife's lawyer?

- I'm <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm here to be a character consultant.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- I got a call from the studio.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Why don't you stand over there and

make sure no one trips over that cable?

</line>


<line>
- This cable?

- Do you have a thousand dollars?

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Because each minute

</line>


<line>
I spend talking to you,

that's how much money I'm wasting.

</line>


<line>
- Oh. Sorry.

- Hey, who's this guy?

</line>


<line>
- Who let this guy in?

- I just--

</line>


<line>
He's got a funny face. I like your face.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- What a cute funny face. Cookie?

</line>


<line>
Can someone get this guy a cookie?

</line>


<line>
He's got a soothing face

and I like looking at it.

</line>


<line>
- Like a <name type="PERSON">Matisse</name> painting.

- Whoa.

</line>


<line>
Guys, could I get

everyone's attention, please?

</line>


<line>
Oh, watch out for the cable.

Don't trip over the cable.

</line>


<line>
I just want everyone to know

what an honor it is to be here.

</line>


<line>
Secretariat has always been

a personal hero of mine.

</line>


<line>
A complex role that requires

a precise touch and a deft hand

and I just can't wait to tackle it

head-on.

</line>


<line>
It's truly an honor.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Namaste.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Neat. So, in this scene,

Secretariat's at his lowest.

</line>


<line>
He just lost his first race,

his father was sent to the glue factory.

</line>


<line>
It's a dark moment.

</line>


<line>
- You got it.

- Scene 22 alpha, take one.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales, then exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>] Action!

- Hey, Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[campy]</nonVerbComm> What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[mumbles, then chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>!

</line>


<line>
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

you're not here with me

in Northern <name type="PERSON">Cordovia</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

</line>


<line>
I didn't think I could do it,

but I did it.

</line>


<line>
I'm amazing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name>,

I know you're doing important work.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't just drop everything

and fly to the Third World.

</line>


<line>
- I just got married, and--

- [<name type="PERSON">Sebastian</name>]<ital> <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

</line>


<line>
And I need people

to witness me witnessing it.

</line>


<line>
I know, and I'll be there in three months,

as soon as I'm done on the movie.

</line>


<line>
This is also important.

</line>


<line>
In a way.

</line>


<line>
Well, lucky for you,

there'll still be just as much famine

and war and devastation

in three months.

</line>


<line>
I'm not dead yet.

</line>


<line>
- Yep. Lucky me.

- [man] We're still rolling, people.

</line>


<line>
So, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, in this scene,

Secretariat is sad, right?

</line>


<line>
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Okay, here we go. Action.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[campy]</nonVerbComm> What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
That was bad. I know that was bad.

Let's keep it rolling.

</line>


<line>
- I'll say when to keep rolling.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
What are you doing here? Did we get it?

I can tell by your face that we didn't.

</line>


<line>
All right, let me try again.

What are you doing--?

</line>


<line>
I am having trouble with the words.

Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

</line>


<line>
When did you get here?

Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

</line>


<line>
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

</line>


<line>
Can we kill these lights at all?

Is that a--?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- Okay, I'm sad.

</line>


<line>
I'm sad. Acting sad.

</line>


<line>
Secretariat is sad.

</line>


<line>
Okay, here we go.

</line>


<line>
I'm sad!

</line>


<line>
Sorry, what was the line?

</line>


<line>
I don't know if this helps or not,

but when Secretariat was a kid

</line>


<line>
- he actually--

- Aah!

</line>


<line>
- My face!

- [man 1] Hey, hey.

</line>


<line>
- Whoa, whoa!

- [man 2] Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 3]</nonVerbComm> Watch out!

[man 4] Hey.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 5 gasps]</nonVerbComm>

[man 6] Whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[PA]</nonVerbComm> Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. My face.

</line>


<line>
My beautiful face.

</line>


<line>
Why didn't someone tell me

not to trip over that cable?

</line>


<line>
It was such an important job,

but no one was there to do it

and now my face is in ruins.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna need a couple of days

to rebuild this set.

</line>


<line>
So, let's all just use this time

to regroup

and really figure out what we're doing

and why we're here.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So, let me get this straight.

Bad means good?

</line>


<line>
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk

to me. <name type="PERSON">Jeezy Kableezy</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, it wasn't <name type="PERSON">Ibsen</name>.

</line>


<line>
That's your takeaway?

That your son's TV show wasn't <name type="PERSON">Ibsen</name>?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I loved the part where you got

your head caught in the banister.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah--

- And what's this letter I have?

</line>


<line>
It's from the government saying,

"I'm proud of you."

</line>


<line>
- Are you--?

- No, what I'm holding is nothing.

</line>


<line>
Can you check on our drinks?

I would love some gin.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open

container. This town is full of AIDS.

</line>


<line>
- That's not--

- You're a clown, you know that?

</line>


<line>
You've always been a pillar of support.

</line>


<line>
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

</line>


<line>
I'm here, aren't I?

I suffered through that ordeal.

</line>


<line>
You know, the man sitting next to me

was wearing a T-shirt?

</line>


<line>
A T-shirt, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, in the theater.

</line>


<line>
Yes, a T-shirt.

</line>


<line>
Worst thing that's happened to anyone

in a theater.

</line>


<line>
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."

- Here we go.

</line>


<line>
I don't know to what "it"

the T-shirt referred

but I won't be spoken to in that tone

by an article of clothing.

</line>


<line>
Vodka? Triple sec?

Looking for any alcohol.

</line>


<line>
You don't know how lucky you are.

</line>


<line>
I hope you die before I do so you never

know what it's like to lose a mother.

</line>


<line>
As long as one of us dies,

that's good enough.

</line>


<line>
Can we please get some alcohol

into my mouth?

</line>

</line>


<line>
- Hey, do you wanna talk?

- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

</line>


<line>
So you can put everything

in a book and sell a million copies?

</line>


<line>
Wow. Uh...

</line>


<line>
That's what the old me would have said.

The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- No.

- I gotta say,

the new you seems a little on edge.

</line>


<line>
What? Me?

I'm as cool as The <name type="PERSON">Fonz</name> in a meat locker.

</line>


<line>
That's a metaphor, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
- It's a simile.

- Goddamn it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay. Hello?

</line>


<line>
Small talk, small talk, small talk.

Are you blowing it?

</line>


<line>
- I heard you're blowing it.

- What? Who told you that? Was it <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

</line>


<line>
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.

If you don't--

</line>


<line>
Hey, can you hold on a second?

I'm getting another call.

</line>


<line>
Well, if it isn't my friend, <name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name>,

the boy prince of the 26th floor.

</line>


<line>
Carolyn.

How are things all the way up on 27?

</line>


<line>
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

</line>


<line>
Killing...

</line>


<line>
Give me some gossip.

</line>


<line>
My wife is making me go

to the opera tonight.

</line>


<line>
I need something to distract me

from the thought of D-bags

singing songs in <name type="NORP">German</name>

about their boners.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you gotta

keep this close to the vest

but I am inches

from getting <name type="PERSON">Emily</name> VanCamp

the lead in Goose <name type="PERSON">Van Sant</name>'s

new movie about Jackie O.

</line>


<line>
My clients would f-l-ip

if I got them parts like that.

</line>


<line>
You're killing it

in the department of kicking ass

in regards to you being an agent

and being good at it, crushing it.

</line>


<line>
You're not so bad yourself, <name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name>,

for a 26er. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
You're the only one in this building

who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

</line>


<line>
Yes, <name type="PERSON">Natasha</name>, I'm talking about you.

I know you're listening.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. I gotta go. I made <name type="PERSON">Natasha</name> cry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't think she's coming back.

</line>


<line>
Could we keep it down

in the front, please?

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- What am I gonna do?

</line>


<line>
Well, you were an actor for nine years

on <ital>Horsin' Around. </ital>How did you do that?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

- Of course, buddy.

</line>


<line>
I always have time for you,

my good friend <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

in this, the year 1988.

</line>


<line>
Have a seat.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stomping overhead]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

</line>


<line>
- Am I-- Am I a clown?

- Oh, brother.

</line>


<line>
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom

to the taping?

</line>


<line>
As Headroom would say,

"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
But I am a good actor, right?

</line>


<line>
BJ, I don't know. Look--

You know what you're good at?

</line>


<line>
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,

loudly with good diction.

</line>


<line>
Should I be doing more?

To capture the character

</line>


<line>
- and make the audience connect?

- This is a situation comedy.

</line>


<line>
No one watches this show to feel feelings.

Life is depressing enough already.

</line>


<line>
You bring joy to millions of people.

</line>


<line>
Maybe someday later,

you'll need to learn how to act for real.

</line>


<line>
But for now,

[chuckles] don't worry about it.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

</line>


<line>
All this time, I assumed there was more

to me than everyone thought

but maybe there isn't.

</line>


<line>
That's the part where you're supposed

to disagree with me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, you got the part, didn't you?

What did you do in the audition?

</line>


<line>
Well, how should I know?

That was the old me.

</line>


<line>
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>. Okay. Okay.

What should I do?

</line>


<line>
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

</line>


<line>
Start a new life there?

Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

</line>


<line>
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

</line>


<line>
Work my way up until I own the place?

</line>


<line>
What am I talking about?

I can't run a textile plant.

</line>


<line>
Too much responsibility. What am I

gonna do? The walls are closing in!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, breathe. You can do this.

</line>


<line>
You have two days.

Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Plus, you can watch old

Secretariat videos.

</line>


<line>
I've got a hard drive full of research.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

You're right. I can do this.

</line>


<line>
I've got two whole days.

</line>


<line>
And when the pressure's on,

that's when I shine.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Two days.

I can do all those things.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

</line>


<line>
- What are you doing here?

- Ah!

</line>


<line>
That was it. Say that again.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[campy]</nonVerbComm> What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- No?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, before we get started

</line>


<line>
- I wanted to show you this.

- What?

</line>


<line>
This is the machine

that's gonna make you a good actor.

</line>


<line>
- Really?

- No. We need to make a scan of your face

so that if you die,

we can finish the movie.

</line>


<line>
Standard procedure. When a star

is assessed to be of a certain liability,

like if there was a whole book written

about what a reckless jackass he is,

you make a digital replica so you're

not screwed if he goes all <name type="PERSON">Belushi</name> on you.

</line>


<line>
- Wait, which <name type="PERSON">Belushi</name>?

- Hold still, please.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whirring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Terrific. We got it.

- One day, that's gonna be the job.

</line>


<line>
Sit for five seconds

while a machine scans his face.

</line>


<line>
Six months later,

plugging a movie on <ital>Kimmel.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I gotta go on <ital>Kimmel </ital>now?

What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

</line>


<line>
I'm not emotionally prepared.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry so much.

If you can't do this part

we'll just fire you and get someone else

who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
- [groans]

- What do you need, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,

but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

</line>


<line>
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?

- I don't make mistakes, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
I do the crossword in <name type="ORG">Sharpie</name>,

I never learned the shortcut for undo.

</line>


<line>
- Command-Z.

- Don't need it, won't use it.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to have this new attitude,

be this better, more positive guy.

</line>


<line>
I keep thinking about how this movie

is my last shot at happiness.

</line>


<line>
Well, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I hope this helps:

</line>


<line>
I don't care if you are happy or not.

</line>


<line>
You have a job to do.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>

Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

</line>


<line>
Can you write on a sign

"watch out for cable"?

</line>


<line>
You were telling people,

but it's a really important job

and a sign is less likely

to get distracted.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

</line>


<line>
What are <ital>you</ital> doing here?

</line>


<line>
What are you doing <ital>here?</ital>

</line>


<line>
What <ital>are</ital> you doing here?

</line>


<line>
- What are you doing here?

- So, I went a little overboard

and I made you two mixes.

</line>


<line>
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.

</line>


<line>
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'

side projects and solo singles.

</line>


<line>
Listen to it and imagine the band

never took that hiatus

in the mid-aughts

when <name type="GPE">America</name> briefly lost interest in ska.

</line>


<line>
I don't have time.

I don't wanna listen to your music.

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna hang out.

Get out of here.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right. You don't wanna listen

to Bosstones together.

</line>


<line>
That's the impression that I get.

</line>


<line>
- Is it the impression that I get?

- Yes. That's the impression that you get.

- Yeah, but--

</line>


<line>
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?

So what if the new couch is weird?

</line>


<line>
- Or lumpy?

- Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
What are you gonna do?

Just sleep in <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s car forever?

</line>


<line>
- Are you talking to me, or you--?

- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

</line>


<line>
It's time to go home

and sleep on <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s couch. Hurray!

Oh, yeah. Uh...

Well, we got some new screen tests

and, uh, Goose decided to go

in a different direction.

</line>

Are you saying the <name type="PERSON">Van Sant</name> camp

wants to recant on VanCamp?

</line>


<line>
Because they can't.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Charley</name>, you better get your client

to change his mind

</line>


<line>
- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--

- Just kidding.

</line>


<line>
- I can't get to the phone right now.

- What?

</line>


<line>
This is one of those answering machines

that sounds like it's <name type="PERSON">Charley</name> talking

but it's actually

just an answering machine.

</line>

<line>
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

for the past few days

thinking about that Jackie O movie.

</line>


<line>
I know it's your baby,

but I did make a few calls

and got my <name type="PERSON">Rooney</name> a screen test.

</line>


<line>
I put that movie together for my client.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, don't freak out.

It's just a screen test.

But, honestly,

how fantaj would my <name type="PERSON">Rooney</name> be

as a young Jackie Bouv?

Stomp once for so fantaj,
