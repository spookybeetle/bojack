Well, the photographer's here.

Where is Crackerjack?

He was aware that we're posing

for a family photo portrait.

can't you ration work?

Oh, that would be a dream,

but who else but I will make sure

the numbers add up

</line>


<line>
we'll sit in a beer garden

and enjoy a pint.

</line>


<line>
All right, Crackerjack, time's a-tickin'.

</line>


<line>
We need to take this portrait

before you and I both take a powder.

</line>


<line>
Sally, why don't you get yourself

some freezy pops,

</line>


<line>
-and keep the change.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Aww, I want a freezy pop.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="ORG">Beatrice</name>, you know

iced cream is for boys.

</line>


<line>
You can sprinkle some sugar on a lemon.

That's a good healthy girl snack.

</line>


<line>
Oh, all right.

Honey Sugarman, how did such a sweet face

end up with such a smart mouth?

I don't know, but I've got half a mind

</line>

-to kiss you with that smart mouth.

-Well, that half you can keep.

</line>


<line>
Oh! I almost forgot.

<line>
Say, if it isn't

my old baby blanket, Blinky.

</line>

I thought you could take it with you.

I'll fight better if I know

Blinky's safe with you.

All right, folks, this is for posterity,

so don't forget to look far away sad.

-No! We are both equally not fat.

You know who looks like BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

Phil the stock boy.

Are you kidding me?

So you were with Sarah Lynn

when she died, right?

-No.

<name type="ORG">-TMZ</name> said you took her to the hospital.

</line>


<line>
-And you held her hand.

-Did you cry?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not--

-Did she totally poop her pants?

</line>


<line>
I heard people poop their pants

when they die.

</line>


<line>
-Listen to me--

-God, is that true?

Because I just read<ital> Romeo and Juliet</ital>

Why would you get Paul Giamatti

to play me... meaty roles like that one?

Hey, buddy, is any of that

to fix the door?

</line>

-What do you care?

-I don't.

And if it were up to me, that old house

would've been torn down years ago.

It's a blight on the neighborhood.

I will let you help me.

-I don't fly.

</line>


<line>
You don't have to fly the plane.

</line>

They got this new thing now,

it's called being a passenger.

</line>


<line>
I have to ask, are you...

</line>


<line>
-BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man? No.

-What? Who's BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

</line>


<line>
Who's BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man?

He's a very famous TV and film star.

</line>


<line>
Or he was, yeah, before he gave it all up

for a life of quiet anonymity.

</line>


<line>
Where is he? Nobody knows.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps a small town just like this one.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps he's even...

in this very room.

</line>


<line>
But he's not,

'cause I'm not BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
What I was going to ask was

if you were related to <name type="GPE">Jose</name>ph Sugarman,

or if you were just <name type="ORG">squattin</name>'

in his house?

</line>


<line>
My grandfather. I used to come here

in the summers when I was a kid.

</line>


<line>
Hasn't got much use in the last 25 years,

except for the termites.

</line>


<line>
Get on out of here, Bobby and Susan!

I saw you gnawin'!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, there isn't any more of us.

</line>


<line>
I'm the last of my line.

</line>


<line>
Once my mother dies and I die

that'll be it,

which is probably for the best.

</line>


<line>
No more of you? [chuckles]

-That'll be great.

-Oh, thank you.

we'll spend here without him.

<nonVerbComm>[gulping]</nonVerbComm> Ahh!

</line>

Sal! Oh, Sally!

</line>


<line>
-Oh! Mrs. Sugarman.

-What happened when he got shot?

</line>


<line>
Was it quick? Did he suffer?

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Eddie, come on. Eddie, let's go!

-[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
-Hey! That's not yours!

-Yeah! We stole that fair and square.

</line>


<line>
-Mrs. S.

-Please, please tell me.

</line>


<line>
Please.

</line>


<line>
Mrs. Sugarman, control yourself.

</line>


<line>

<line>
-Hey, gimme that!

</line>


<line>

Why did everybody stop, huh?

What's the gag?

I want to dance. I want to fly!

<nonVerbComm>[sobbing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Listen, you're sloshed

and making a scene.

</line>


<line>
Do the responsible thing:

have one more drink to steady your nerves

and then drive yourself

and your yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g daughter home.

</line>


<line>
Don't make me go back

to that quiet house, please.

</line>


<line>
-Mother, let's go.

-Eddie, let's go!

</line>


<line>
-Are you all right?

-It's okay. I'm okay.

</line>


<line>
My hands are doing the wiggly doozle

in three-four time, but--

</line>


<line>
Say, I got a swell idea.

Why don't you drive?

</line>


<line>
But I don't know how.

</line>


<line>
Why, it's only as easy

as finding a hobo in a barrel of beans.

</line>


<line>
It'll be grand.

Everything will be just grand.

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack laughing]

-[Eddie] Whoo!

</line>


<line>
-[shouting]

-Get back here!

</line>


<line>
Aaah! [gasps]

</line>


<line>
-Jeepers!

-[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
Yeah! We're hooligans!

</line>


<line>
Faster. I want to feel alive again.

</line>


<line>
I'd do anything to feel alive.

<nonVerbComm>[Eddie laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I gotta say, you really knew

how to handle those salad tongs

for someone who appears

to have never eaten a salad.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.

</line>


<line>
You're like a Josh Groban

who doesn't also think he's f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, now, the house

is absolutely, totally finished.

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
I wish I could somehow

pay you back for all your help.

</line>


<line>
Don't sweat it.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Eddie.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!

-[crashing]

</line>


<line>
-Ow! [groans]

-What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
What the hell'd you do that for?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, I thought

you would fly to save me

and by making you fly I would,

in a sense, be saving you!

</line>


<line>
How many times do I have to tell you?

I don't fly!

</line>


<line>
You're flying right now, asshole!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps, groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Why'd you make me do that?

-[groans] You're welcome.

</line>


<line>
I haven't flown since Lorraine died,

and now you ruined it.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Obviously, this was not

the preferred outcome for either of us.

</line>


<line>
You want to fly?

All right, let's fly. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit. No, I'm fine, actually.

-You want to go higher?

</line>


<line>
You want to see how high we can go?

</line>


<line>
Clearly, this is a sore subject. I was

wrong to bring it up. Let's go back down.

</line>


<line>
The night Lorraine died

she wanted to go back,

but I wanted to see

how high we could go.

</line>


<line>
Whoa! Plane! Look out!

</line>


<line>
You want to know how Lorraine felt

when she got sucked into that engine?

</line>


<line>
-We're all just tiny bugs, right?

-[groaning]

</line>


<line>
Aaaah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, God. No, no, come on.

</line>


<line>
-Come on.

-[coughing]

</line>


<line>
Are you insane?!

</line>


<line>
I don't want to live!

</line>


<line>
Why did you save me?

[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
I don't want to live!

hoofing aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the dance floor

like a motorized freckle?

</line>


<line>
-Did you snap your cap?

-You mustn't despise me, darling.

</line>


<line>
-Please.

-That's before mentioning poor <name type="ORG">Beatrice</name>.

</line>


<line>
You aiming to get her killed as well?

She's all we got.

</line>


<line>
Oh, don't be cross with Mother!

</line>


<line>
I don't know what's wrong with me.

</line>


<line>
How am I supposed to sell sugar <ital>and</ital>

keep my <name type="ORG">sec</name>retary's self-esteem afloat

when you're having

honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria?

</line>


<line>
-Don't yell, Father.

-I just can't anymore.

</line>


<line>
I can't stop thinking about him.

</line>


<line>
I can't be with people

and I can't be alone.

</line>


<line>
I don't know how to be better, <name type="GPE">Jose</name>ph.

Are you okay?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm> I don't know. I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
It's okay. Talk to me.

What's going on?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's <name type="GPE">Michigan</name>,</ital>

<ital>and it's beautiful here,</ital>

</line>


<line>
-and everything sucks.

<ital>-<name type="GPE">Michigan</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, come home.

<ital>-I can't.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't belong there,

I don't belong anywhere.

</line>


<line>
But that's the thing,

everybody belongs in <name type="GPE">Los Angeles</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-There's, like, no barrier for entry.</ital>

-Oh, God, that's true. [sighs]

</line>


<line>
They do let in just anybody.

</line>


<line>
I was at a coffee shop yesterday,

I heard a guy trying to impress someone

by soft-pitching a web series

he crowdf<name type="ORG">un</name>ded.

</line>


<line>
Let me guess: the web series is about

how f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny he and his friends are,

</line>


<line>
-just, like, hanging out.

-He described it as <name type="ORG">HBO</name>'s <ital>Girls</ital>

</line>


<line>
-but, like, from a guy's perspective.

<ital>-What?!</ital>

</line>


<line>
And he's just giving this away for free

in a coffee shop?

</line>


<line>
Somebody get this guy an overall!

</line>


<line>
Well, the important thing

is that barista's

definitely going to have sex

with him later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I've missed you, Diane.

</line>


<line>
I've missed you, too.

</line>


<line>
Mmm. [slurping]

</line>


<line>
-Is Mother okay?

-She is now.

</line>


<line>
She just let her womanly emotions

get the better of her, that's all.

</line>


<line>
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.

</line>


<line>
Operation?

</line>


<line>
What's broken in the heart

can never be repaired,

but the brain, well, we have

all sorts of science for the brain.

</line>


<line>
She's a brand new woman now,

and she'd like to meet you very much.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[note plays]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Mother?

-Oh, hello.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="ORG">Beatrice</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yes, that's right.

What a pretty girl.

</line>


<line>
-What did they do to you? [sobs]

-Oh, hush.

</line>


<line>
It's okay. I'm better now.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

</line>


<line>
Love does things to a person,

terrible things.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffles, sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Beatrice</name>, promise me

you'll never love anyone

</line>


<line>
-as much as I loved Crackerjack.

-I promise. I won't.

</line>


<line>
Why, I have half a mind...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[truck advancing, beeping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

There we go, big boy.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's going on out here?

</line>


<line>
Probably should have warned you,

when these guys tear the house down

it might make some noise.

</line>


<line>
Tear the <ital>house </ital>down?!

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah. You think I just want

to mope aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d in a shrine to the past,

getting off on my own guilt

while the rest of my life passes me by?

</line>


<line>
Pathetic, much?

</line>


<line>
But we spent the last eight months

restoring this place.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

</line>


<line>
That's usually a series wrap

on a friendship.

</line>


<line>
-What is a series wrap?

-Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, what am I doing

in this backwash of a town?

</line>


<line>
Do you even get <name type="ORG">Showtime</name> here?

</line>


<line>
-So what was all this for?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Guess it was just a big waste of time.

<line>
But you can't change the past.

<name type="ORG">Time</name>'s arrow marches on, right?

I don't believe this.
