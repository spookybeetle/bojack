<ital>I'm not kidding. The pills. Now!</ital>

<ital>I told you, I'm on a system now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm not doing drugs. I'm not like you.</ital>

<ital>I don't fetishize my own sadness.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>No, my hands are so slippery.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Damn it, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>. Clean up your shit.</ital>

<ital>You know I had sex with <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Turns out there's a brand of heroin</ital>

<ital>called <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Please don't make me go back to LA.</ital>

<ital>You can count on me, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm><ital> You are all the things</ital>

<ital>that are wrong with you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>]</nonVerbComm><ital> You haven't changed.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Yes, you are the last person</ital>

<ital>to get that. I'm not gonna change.</ital>

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>]</nonVerbComm> Ow! You're hurting me.

Let me go! [grunting]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> got into vodka.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is she okay?

-<name type="PERSON">Danny</name> knows she got it from you.

</line>


<line>
-It was yours.

-Mine, yours.

</line>


<line>
What difference does it make

who brought this particular vodka?

</line>


<line>
If I take the fall for this,

this whole show is over.

</line>


<line>
And that means everything I did

was for nothing.

</line>


<line>
-What you did?

-To <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>, I mean.

</line>


<line>
What I did to save the show,

do you understand?

</line>


<line>
-All that's pointless if it goes away now.

-So, what am I supposed to do?

</line>


<line>
I have friends on <ital>Coach</ital>

who owe me a favor.

</line>


<line>
-It could be a fresh start for you.

-There's no such thing as a fresh start.

</line>


<line>
It's an easy job.

Craig T. Nelson's balder by the day.

</line>


<line>
What if I say n-- no?

</line>


<line>
Nobody is asking you, <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>,

would you like to share? I...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[stammers]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry.

I don't know who you are.

</line>


<line>
This is anonymous.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>? Who's that?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Um, yeah. Um...

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and, uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name>, this feels so dumb.

</line>


<line>
And I'm an alcoholic.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Hi, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
Look, I can't go to the <name type="LOC">Galapagos</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>, you have to.

This is an important job.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> It's the National Geographic

Swimsuit Edition.

</line>


<line>
They want me shooting behind-the-scenes

video of turtles in bikinis.

</line>


<line>
Seems unimportant in light

of what you've been dealing with.

</line>


<line>
What I'm dealing with?

</line>


<line>
Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.

</line>


<line>
Okay, yeah, I've been a little depressed.

But I'm not like <ital>depressed.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't have depression.

</line>


<line>
You're smoking three packs a day,

</line>


<line>
you've been wearing the same

pajama bottoms for weeks...

</line>


<line>
This is all part of my writing process.

</line>


<line>
My best stuff comes out

when I hate myself.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

What stuff? No stuff is coming out.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'd feel better if you just tried

the medication your doctor prescribed.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'd feel worse.

</line>


<line>
They put me on <name type="ORG">Prozac</name> in college

and I was so calm and boring,

</line>


<line>
I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.

</line>


<line>
And then <ital>Dawson's Creek </ital>got bad because

there was no one to speak truth to power.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Dawson's Creek</ital> did not get bad.

</line>


<line>
You just started taking antidepressants,

which you should also do now.

</line>


<line>
It sucks. It made me break out.

I gained weight.

</line>


<line>
What if you leave and come back

to this person you don't even recognize?

</line>


<line>
I don't even recognize you now.

</line>


<line>
You're making this a bigger thing

than it is. I'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
Don't fall for one of those models.

</line>


<line>
I'm a one-woman man.

</line>


<line>
If that woman happens

to be a turtle in a two-piece,

</line>


<line>
-that's just destiny.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[knocks on door]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> You're the most beautiful person

in the world to me. You know that, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
These strike negotiations

have lasted so long,

it's like <ital>Reds</ital> in this boardroom.

</line>


<line>
Remember <ital>Reds?</ital> Two VHS tapes.

</line>


<line>
That's too many tapes, I said,

but no one listens to <name type="PERSON">Lenny</name>.

</line>


<line>
How's this look?

</line>


<line>
Generous, but you're making up

the projected loss

by excising office birthday cakes.

That's unacceptable.

</line>


<line>
Everybody hates office parties.

</line>


<line>
Everyone hates the mysterious

dried fruit cubes in trail mix

but we still eat them after the other nuts

and seeds are gone

because in our undervalued,

overworked existence,

we're desperate

for any morsel of satisfaction,

whether that be cake,

unidentifiable orange fruit shards

or the occasional kind word from our boss.

</line>


<line>
I like cake.

They can print those pictures on them now.

</line>


<line>
What's the issue here?

</line>


<line>
Fine. But we're grouping birthdays

so they only happen once a month.

</line>


<line>
We accept those terms.

We're left with one final issue.

</line>


<line>
Your insistence assistants

be not treated like garbage?

</line>


<line>
From this day forth, all assistants

will be treated like recycling.

</line>


<line>
Right next to the garbage,

but with an understanding that one day,

they may be up-cycled to a higher status.

</line>


<line>
Like a bunch of seatbelts

that got turned into a purse.

</line>


<line>
Or a license plate that gets turned

into a purse. Right, <name type="PERSON">Lenny</name>?

</line>


<line>
Sure, sure. I'm green.

</line>


<line>
-We're amenable to these terms.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Judah</name>. I meant to reach out--

-There's no need to explain,

</line>


<line>
I know you're very busy

with work and <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> You have no idea.

</line>


<line>
I have some idea.

</line>


<line>
You talked about it quite often

during the negotiations.

</line>


<line>
This strike has been the most time I've

been able to spend with <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> since...

</line>


<line>
-[coos]

-...ever.

</line>


<line>
I also feel an ambivalence

about the strike ending.

</line>


<line>
The negotiations have been

quite invigorating.

</line>


<line>
And now you're just gonna ride off

into the sunset?

</line>


<line>
No, the sun sets in the west.

</line>


<line>
I'm riding east to my <name type="LOC">Atwater</name> cottage.

[grunts] Goodbye.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Judah</name>!

-Yes?

</line>


<line>
You're the best assistant I ever had.

</line>


<line>
You don't need <ital>ever</ital> in that sentence.

It's implied.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[indistinct chattering]

-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Oh, uh...

-Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for meeting me here.

I can't be at my house.

</line>


<line>
Just reminds me

of what an asshole I've been.

</line>


<line>
Makes sense. Your house reminds me

of what an asshole you've been, too.

</line>


<line>
-[camera shutter clicking]

-Uh... what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
I'm updating my asexual dating profile

with some fresh pics.

</line>


<line>
There's still no one else on the app,

but when they join, I wanna be ready.

</line>


<line>
Look at this busted photo.

It's from over a year ago.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you gotta stay current.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.

Oh, I actually have a job!

</line>


<line>
Hype man for babies.

</line>


<line>
You've really taken to this

nanny thing, huh?

</line>


<line>
I love it. It's so amazing

to hold a baby and look at it sleep

and think, "This is a perfect thing."

</line>


<line>
-I can't imagine.

-It's weird to think that at one point,

someone held me in their hands

and thought,

</line>


<line>
"I'm going to love this kid forever,"

you know? What happened?

</line>


<line>
What happened to what?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Moms are weird, right?

</line>


<line>
Um... Yeah, moms are weird.

</line>


<line>
So, what are you gonna do now?

Just keep getting lunch with your friends?

</line>


<line>
There was a stewardess in the meeting.

</line>


<line>
She was talking about how every day,

she wakes up in a different place.

</line>


<line>
I thought, "That sounds perfect."

</line>


<line>
Every city a clean slate?

</line>


<line>
Stewardess?

</line>


<line>
I think the preferred term

is flight servant.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[soft music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
To us! And depression!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Yes, but before I drink to that

and then depart with you

on a cross-country tour

of speaking engagements

as the quote-unquote "Face of Depression,"

there is something I feel

I must get off my chest.

</line>


<line>
As it says on the cover of my last single

"You Can Tell Me Anything,"

you can tell me anything.

</line>


<line>
-I am not depressed.

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Wait. How can you know that?

</line>


<line>
Well, I feel very happy.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Just as I suspected, half-full!

</line>


<line>
Hmm. That is a troubling development.

</line>


<line>
And right before our tour!

</line>


<line>
I would be quite upset by this

if I were at all prone to depression,

which, as we've just established,

I am not.

</line>


<line>
But isn't it possible that

you are depressed and just don't know it?

</line>


<line>
Well, I do frequently not know things.

</line>


<line>
According to the literature for this tour

that I did not read

but had my mom peruse

and then paraphrase for me,

people who seem happy can actually

be the most depressed.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! I seem very happy!

</line>


<line>
-I know.

-But wait! You seem happy, too!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.

-We gotta get the word out.

</line>


<line>
-A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.

-3.25.

</line>


<line>
Four and five.

</line>


<line>
As <name type="PERSON">Gandhi</name> says, "Make the change you wish

to see in the world."

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, change. Good luck out there.

I'll miss you.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what?

-It's for the best. Go.

</line>


<line>
Just go, please.

Don't make it harder than it has to be.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[birds chirping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thunder rumbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What is depression?

-Depression.

</line>


<line>
-Who is depression?

-You or someone you love.

</line>


<line>
-Where is depression?

-A grassy field, perhaps.

</line>


<line>
If any of these words describe you

or your feelings, you may suffer from...

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Depression.</ital>

<ital>-...depression.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

-Surprise!

</line>


<line>
-Uh, is this a bad time or...?

-No.

</line>


<line>
It's just...

</line>


<line>
Heat's broken. Let's go for a walk.

</line>


<line>
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

-I didn't know.

</line>


<line>
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so...

</line>


<line>
-I'm glad you're here.

-You doing okay?

</line>


<line>
I'm doing great.

I have this wonderful boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
I got an advance

on a book of personal essays.

</line>


<line>
Me, personal essays.

</line>


<line>
I mean, who am I? <name type="ORG">Sloane</name> Crosley?

</line>


<line>
-Who's <name type="ORG">Sloane</name> Crosley?

-Good point. Who's <name type="ORG">Sloane</name> Crosley?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, who is <name type="ORG">Sloane</name> Crosley?

</line>


<line>
Exactly.

</line>


<line>
But the headline is you're doing great?

</line>


<line>
So great.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[slurps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Can I crash at your apartment?

-No!

</line>


<line>
-I think I'm depressed.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
It started when I was having trouble

with my book,

and then it kind of snowballed

into my boyfriend saying

I should take antidepressants.

</line>


<line>
-Are you going to?

-What's the point?

</line>


<line>
Of antidepressants? I believe the point

is to be antidepressed.

</line>


<line>
Sure. Or you just flip over the nothing

and underneath there's more nothing.

</line>


<line>
Then you flip over that nothing

and there's more nothing underneath that.

</line>


<line>
So, you just keep flipping over nothings,

all your life,

because you keep thinking

under all that nothing,

there's gotta be something,

but all you find is nothing.

</line>


<line>
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box,

uh, and look, a couch!

</line>


<line>
We're gonna break up soon anyway.

</line>


<line>
There's only so long before he gets tired

of the real me.

</line>


<line>
The real you being...?

</line>


<line>
Ta-da!

</line>


<line>
You know, someone got really mad

at me recently...

</line>


<line>
Mad? At you?

</line>


<line>
I know, shocking.

</line>


<line>
And he said, "<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you ruin everything.

</line>


<line>
-That's what you are."

-Oof.

</line>


<line>
And it actually took him saying it

out loud

for me to realize how stupid that is,

even though I believed it for so long.

</line>


<line>
I bought into this idea that I was a thing

that couldn't be changed.

</line>


<line>
So, the reason I came to <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> is...

</line>


<line>
I wanted to thank you

for believing in me when I didn't,

and for encouraging me

to accept the help I needed.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[melancholic music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales, groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
-[wind howling]

-[shudders]

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
-[groans] Mm?

-[yelps]

</line>


<line>
So, I'm really glad you're here,

but a little notice next time?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, sorry.

</line>


<line>
I already made plans with Tawnie.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-[screams]

</line>


<line>
Hi, Tawnie. Why are you in the backseat?

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.

It's both minute and massive.

</line>


<line>
How can it be minute and massive?

</line>


<line>
It's a paradox.

It's <name type="PERSON">Sylvia Plath</name> wearing <name type="GPE">Saint Laurent</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> <name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name>.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, we're going to a show.

You're welcome to join us.

</line>


<line>
Great. A music show? I love music.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[discordant sounds playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, is this what music sounds like

when you're sober?

</line>


<line>
-Do I hate music?

-No, this sucks.

</line>


<line>
I'm just here because

I wanted to cheer up Tawnie.

</line>


<line>
I thought you were in a fight.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but I still don't want her

to feel bad.

</line>


<line>
She's my best friend.

They cancelled all the drama classes.

</line>


<line>
What? Why?

</line>


<line>
The acting professor quit.

He got cast in a regional commercial.

</line>


<line>
And he quit? Wow.

</line>


<line>
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gotta

change her major,

which I get why that sucks,

but don't take it out on me.

</line>


<line>
I'll bet a lot of actors would love

to teach at a place like this.

</line>


<line>
They're not looking for a replacement?

</line>


<line>
Maybe they are. I don't know.

What do I look like, the <name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name> Argus?

</line>


<line>
Okay, I don't wanna be fighting anymore,

so can we just drop it?

</line>


<line>
-You always do this.

-I'm trying to move past it.

</line>


<line>
You said we were gonna meet

at Pi Café for dinner.

</line>


<line>
-I forgot.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
That hurt my feelings.

Now we're just supposed to move past it?

</line>


<line>
Ah, I see. A teachable moment.

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock, people will disappoint you.

</line>


<line>
You're always mad at me.

There's nothing I can say.

</line>


<line>
Yes, some wounds will never be healed.

</line>


<line>
You could say sorry.

</line>


<line>
-Would it even matter?

-No, words are meaningless.

</line>


<line>
Yes. You do this thing where

you don't think you can ever be forgiven,

so you don't apologize,

but I can't forgive you

if you don't say you're sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm... sorry.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. That's all I wanted.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-I love you.

</line>


<line>
I love you, too.

</line>


<line>
Come here. Mm!

</line>


<line>
That's it?

</line>


<line>
-Come on, let's dance. [chuckles]

-Yeah!

</line>


<line>
-Uh... [groans]

-[Hollyhock] <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm really glad you came to visit.

</line>


<line>
-Where are you going next?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Where is not winter?

-<name type="GPE">California</name>?

</line>


<line>
No, I can't go back there. Not yet.

</line>


<line>
-Florida?

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
-Arizona?

-Some parts of <name type="GPE">Texas</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, people come

to the airport just to eat these things.

</line>


<line>
But if their houses were made

of cinnamon and dough,

they wouldn't have to go anywhere!

</line>


<line>
They could eat and live happily

in their <name type="ORG">Cinnabungalow</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, I think it's a great idea

and this customer thinks so, too.

</line>


<line>
-Right, Lonely Horse <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>?

-Sure.

</line>


<line>
He loves it! You better get in on this

before there's a bidding war.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> No, I'm not dating anyone.

Stay on topic, Mom.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="PERSON">Amelia Earhart</name> flew through the skies

until one day, she made it to the sun

and everybody cheered. The end.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[knocking on door]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[Princess Carolyn] Oh.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
I'm out of rehab and I realized I never

got you a baby shower gift, so... here.

<line>
If I'm gonna live in that house again,

</line>


<line>
I wanna get rid of the things

that remind me of my old life.

</line>


<line>
Look what Uncle <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

brought you, <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's a 1970s pop art interpretation

of the <name type="PERSON">Narcissus</name> myth.

</line>


<line>
How appropriate for a baby.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Narcissus</name>?

I thought the painting was about me.

</line>


<line>
But enough about your baby,

I also have a favor to ask.

</line>


<line>
Of course you do.

</line>


<line>
There's this drama professor job

at <name type="ORG">Wesleyan</name>.

</line>


<line>
They need a reference to tell them

that I know what I'm talking about,

that I'm dependable and passionate.

</line>


<line>
So, I thought that you could do

what you've been doing for 20 years

and lie about me.

</line>


<line>
I'll be back at the office tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
But have them call my cell

because my assistant is terrible.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffles]</nonVerbComm> Oh.

</line>


<line>
It's okay, she sucks at it now,

but she'll get better at it.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna miss everything.

We have this connection now.

</line>


<line>
What if that goes away

when I go back to work?

</line>


<line>
So don't go back.

</line>


<line>
What? I'm dying here, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

I need my job. I love my job.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-It's just...

</line>


<line>
There's always so much stupid bullshit

to take care of there.

</line>


<line>
Aren't you the boss?

Why are you doing the stupid bullshit?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Hey, my only responsibility right now

is to not drink and I'm barely getting by.

</line>


<line>

running a company,

and peck out my chances?

</line>


<line>
That is so... like her.

</line>


<line>
I still can't get comfortable in my house.

</line>


<line>
It's huge and perfect, but it feels

like the worst place on earth.

</line>


<line>
No offense, <name type="PERSON">Benny</name>, living in

your storage locker sounds pretty rough.

</line>

Every day, it just keeps getting better.

</line>

<name type="PERSON">God</name>, you're killing me, <name type="PERSON">Benny</name>.

</line>

My house reminds me

of the horse I was before.

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna be him again.

</line>


<line>
But it's the same house, the same city,

just nothing's changed,

so how am I supposed to?

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-<name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>, I--

I'd like to try to--

<line>
The last time I saw you

was my rock bottom.

</line>


<line>
I've been sober ever since.

</line>


<line>
So it all worked out, okay?

</line>


<line>
Please, just let me say it.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

</line>

It was nice of you

to bring <name type="ORG">Panda Express</name> for everyone.

-Is it like a <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> thing?

-No, it's not that. I told you.

</line>


<line>
I'm just confused, is all.

Because I thought you liked me.

</line>


<line>
I do, but I was very clear

there are certain things

that I'm not interested in.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> So, why did you go out with me

in the first place?

</line>


<line>
-Because I like you! But it's complicated.

-And you're sure it's not a <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> thing?

</line>

Fine, if it helps end this conversation,

yes, it's a <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> thing.

What would <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> do? Not this guy.
