</line>


<line>
Mind if I put you on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld one <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond?

</line>


<line>
Don't put me on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld.

Do you know w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I am?

</line>


<line>
I just won a Baby's C<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice Award,

the winner of which

has gone to take <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>

<line>
Otherwise known as the guy you keep

sending your dumb newspaper to

even t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh I never subscribed to it.

</line>


<line>
I'm putting you on <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld.

</line>


<line>
-We have a situation, sir.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>alk to me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>'s name is <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

He's pretty steamed.

</line>


<line>
I've tried everything, but we might need

to bring the Closer in on this one.

</line>


<line>
Calm down. We can sort this out

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut having to get the Closer involved.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you offer 26 weeks

at 50 percent off the newsstand price?

</line>


<line>
I went through the entire checklist, sir.

Even offered him a free tote bag.

</line>


<line>
What kind of monster says no

to a tote bag? <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d work, rep.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've done all that could be

expected of you. I'll take it from here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Got it. Right.

I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand. I'll take it from here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">God</name> help us...

</line>


<line>
Is what I'd say if we needed <name type="PERSON">God</name>'s help.

Fort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately, we got one better.

<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>rning. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d morning.

<line>
I never subscribed to the <ital>L.A. <name type="PERSON">Gaz</name>ette.</ital>

I do not read the <ital>L.A. <name type="PERSON">Gaz</name>ette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I have called this number so many times

to stop sending it to me.

</line>


<line>
Yet every morning, I open my door

on a new edition of the <ital>L.A. <name type="PERSON">Gaz</name>ette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's like I'm in a boring episode

of <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">T</name>wilight Zone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Sir, we are going to <name type="ORG">un</name>ravel this mystery.

</line>


<line>
But before we dig in,

is there anything I can get you?

</line>


<line>
A glass of ice water perhaps?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

</line>


<line>
Fabulous. <name type="PERSON">John</name>ny will get that to you

in three, two, one...

</line>


<line>
-[drone whirring]

-Uh... huh.

</line>


<line>
I see you've been receiving

our paper for six months,

</line>


<line>
but there's no record of you

ever registering a complaint.

</line>


<line>
From whence the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>stility, co<name type="ORG">un</name>selor?

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a problem <name type="ORG">un</name>til recently,

because up <name type="ORG">un</name>til a week ago

</line>


<line>
the boy w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> lives with me used the paper

to make a giant paper-mâché <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd head.

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-I live with my best friend, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d kid, but sometimes

he gets ideas to do things.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groaning, screaming]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Pretty scary, right?

-Yes. What the hell is that?

</line>


<line>
Giant <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd Head, of course.

</line>


<line>
I've been working on him

for the last six months.

</line>


<line>
What? Why?

</line>


<line>
It all started

when a rustling from the kitchen

</line>


<line>
jostled me from tender slumber.

</line>


<line>
-[blinds rattling]

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
What was that?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
If there's a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st present,

please do not scream

or have a skull face or be wearing

a tattered white satin gown.

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Someone or something is stealing our food.

</line>


<line>
I made a giant papier-mâché <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd head

to scare it away. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hink it'll work?

</line>


<line>
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,

would you stop eating my food?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld take this seriously.

We might have an infestation.

</line>


<line>
We do have an infestation, of <name type="PERSON">T</name>odds.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at that, they're getting bigger.

</line>


<line>
And? <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d the head help to ameliorate

your pest peccadillo?

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd abandoned the project as soon

as he started working on <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-What's <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>?</ital>

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I said.

</line>


<line>
-What's <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I said.

</line>


<line>
-What's <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what we want you to say.

</line>


<line>
If I didn't know any better,

you were about to pitch an idea.

</line>


<line>
-We <ital>are </ital>about to pitch you an idea.

-I did not know better.

</line>


<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

Hey, where you headed?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat happens to me all the time.

</line>


<line>
-We're not at the main part yet.

-I'm so sorry. Please continue.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>o the opera, good sir.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Am I watching to see if the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing

has happened to me?

</line>


<line>
-Or looking for one specific thing?

-Kind of both.

</line>


<line>
So I just keep watching <name type="ORG">un</name>til I see

something that has happened to me?

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-What if we get to the end,

none of it has ever happened to me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe just try to put yourself

in <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>'s s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>es right now.

</line>


<line>
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.

Please continue.

</line>


<line>
-So, is this where you live?

-Yes, it is.

</line>


<line>
-Alone or are you in a relationship?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his hardly seems appropriate.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Driver</name>, you're starting

to make me feel <name type="ORG">un</name>comfortable.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Has a creepy driver

ever given you his number

or told you that you reminded him

of his dead girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Or repeated your address slowly,

like he was trying to memorize it?

</line>


<line>
-No, never.

-Unfort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately, if you are a woman

all t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se things

would happen to you every day.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

According to my own research,

nine out of ten men

are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.

</line>


<line>
But what if there was a ride-share service

that could guarantee

no creepy men drivers

because there are no men drivers at all?

</line>


<line>
What are you saying, robot drivers?

</line>


<line>
What if they become sentient

and try to murder us, or <name type="ORG">un</name>ionize?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat could be a real headache.

</line>


<line>
No, not murderous robots. Women.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, you have done it a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Actually, <name type="PERSON">Emily</name> and I

came up with it together.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd and <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>,

you've done it a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in for the first time.

</line>


<line>
And that's why we're setting up s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p

at your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Why does it have to be my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no room

at Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> can recall?

</line>


<line>
I figure the longer they're there,

the bigger the payoff.

</line>


<line>
And they've been sitting there

for months now.

</line>


<line>
So you can bet

the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Closer]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital>So, why did you let them use your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?</ital>

</line>


<line>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>odd had this old girlfriend.</ital>

<ital>I met her a couple weeks back.</ital>

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
-What are you still doing up?

-I got thirsty.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen you came to the right place.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we call <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd,

see if he wants to join us?

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of trying to figure out

what <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd wants.

</line>


<line>
And what do you want?

</line>


<line>
-I'll start with a whiskey.

-My kind of girl.

</line>


<line>
-So then we had sex.

-What? Why?

</line>


<line>
I was lonely? She was there?

Why does anyone have sex with anyone?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Intimacy, affection, a deep need</ital>

<ital>to connect to the world at large.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he same reasons three million people

subscribe to the <ital>L.A. <name type="PERSON">Gaz</name>ette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

<ital>-I'm getting ahead of myself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Please, continue your story.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[exhaling]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a mistake.

</line>


<line>
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake

for you and a regular mistake for me.

</line>


<line>
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.

</line>


<line>
-What are we <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> tell <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

-Nothing, obviously.

</line>


<line>
-I don't want to hurt him.

-Neither do I.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why we won't tell him.

-I feel like we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld tell him.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat feeling is you selfishly

trying to assuage your guilt.

</line>


<line>
If you cared about <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd,

you would keep this a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret forever.

</line>


<line>
I'm not good at lying.

</line>


<line>
Ask me if when I was a little girl,

did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

in my <name type="ORG">un</name>derpants

and rock back and forth on it.

</line>


<line>
When you were a little girl,

did you ever do that thing you said?

</line>


<line>
What? <name type="PERSON">Get--</name> [sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers] No!

</line>


<line>
I think it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be fine.

Why would it even come up?

</line>


<line>
Not like there's any reason

the three of us

would ever be in a room together a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, you remember <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>, right?

</line>


<line>
-I've never seen you before in my life.

-No.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't remember <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

-Oh, yeah. <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
What... why... What are you here?

Why are you doing at <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use? <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
It's cool if we set up s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p here, right?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be weird?

</line>


<line>
What? Why would that be weird?

</line>


<line>
-What are you implying?

-Nothing.

</line>


<line>
It's not weird for me either,

if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, what is going on here?

-Why would you? I don't even--

</line>


<line>
-Literally nothing going on.

-No, something's going on.

</line>


<line>
I've got a nose for news.

</line>


<line>
In this case, <name type="ORG">Nu</name> is the <name type="NORP">Greek</name> letter

representing the variable

for "What Is Going On?"

</line>


<line>
So let's solve for <name type="ORG">Nu</name>, shall we?

</line>


<line>
I think someone's not saying something

to someone else about something.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's crazy.

-I know what it is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>'s going to be huge.

</line>


<line>
No one wants to say it out loud

because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is exactly what it is.

</line>


<line>
Yes. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur stupid business

is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be very successful.

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-Glad that's out in the open.

</line>


<line>
We all know what everyone was thinking,

we don't need to ask

any more questions

or do any wondering about mysteries.

</line>


<line>
Nope.

</line>


<line>
If you'll excuse me,

I need to go watch a sport.

</line>


<line>
Great idea.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he worst part is things have actually

been going really well with <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
Our friendship is in a really good place.

</line>


<line>
Last week he said,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you know the wiener dog

is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

</line>


<line>
Instead of saying,

"Shut up, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd," I said, <name type="PERSON">"Okay</name>."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Closer]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>So, why did you</ital>

<ital>sleep with <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you think that part of you was getting</ital>

<ital><name type="ORG">un</name>comfortable with that closeness?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u felt like you didn't deserve</ital>

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's friendship</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and you wanted to some<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</ital>

<ital>externalize that feeling into action?</ital>

</line>


<line>
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le.

Can't it just be that?

</line>


<line>
When you do bad things,

you have something you can point to

when people eventually leave you.

</line>


<line>
It's not you, you tell yourself,

it's that bad thing you did.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Are you afraid of being known</ital>

<ital>and knowing others?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you know, I think that you're

definitely hitting on something real

that I would love to drill down into,

but I gotta go

to this marketing meeting now.

</line>


<line>
Which is so annoying

because I totally want to keep talking

about that thing you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
But marketing meetings, right?

</line>


<line>
I mean, they're so important.

Can I call you back tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Of course.</ital>

-Great. Bye.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-So, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w was your marketing meeting?</ital>

-Weird.

</line>


<line>
-Sorry I'm late.

-It's fine. We're just getting started.

</line>


<line>
I had the worst morning.

</line>


<line>
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

</line>


<line>
So I drove here, right?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm sitting at the entrance to the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rage</ital>

<ital>when I realize I don't have my key card.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I gotta drive all the way <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me to get it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>When I got there,</ital>

<ital>I couldn't find it anywhere.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Suddenly, I remember:</ital>

<ital>I put it in the glove compartment.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It was in my car the entire time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Because I was driving back and forth

so much, I ran out of <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s.

</line>


<line>
I pulled into a 76.

</line>


<line>
I was about to pump the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s,

I realized I didn't have my credit card,

when I remembered

it was on my desk at <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

because I used it to contribute to

my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane...

</line>


<line>
Have you donated

to <name type="GPE">Virginia</name>'s dumb Kickstarter yet?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hrow her 50 bucks. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can afford it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but I don't like feeling

like I have to, <name type="PERSON">Roxy</name>.

</line>


<line>
Does the world need

a stop-motion s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rt film

about a pig w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> goes to circus sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hink of it like you're doing

a nice thing for your friend.

</line>


<line>
M<name type="PERSON">mm</name>... okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I called a cab to take me <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me</ital>

<ital>to get my credit card.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen back to the <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s station, get my car,

fill it up and come here.

</line>


<line>
So that's why I'm late.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you tell us that w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le story?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you tell me that w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le story?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up

some options for the new <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat </ital>ads.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d news is the movie

is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

</line>


<line>
If everyone loves it,

why do we need a new ad campaign?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese are

the "For <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur Consideration" ads.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're a reminder to the <name type="ORG">Aca<name type="NORP">dem</name>y</name>,

"Have you considered this yet?"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="ORG">Aca<name type="NORP">dem</name>y</name> doesn't always

consider everything.

</line>


<line>
So they need constant

consideration reminders.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's very considerate.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his one tested the best.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a good one.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he rest of these suck.

</line>


<line>
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

</line>


<line>
Ugly. <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ring. <name type="PERSON">T</name>ypical. Stupid.

</line>


<line>
Bad. Hideous. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>sgusting. Gross. Cliché.

</line>


<line>
-I am really good at this.

-<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
-I kind of like this one.

-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

</line>


<line>
We ruled that one out.

</line>


<line>
It's actually really powerful.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Closer]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>What spoke to you</ital>

<ital>about that particular ad?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>I don't know.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>All the pictures of me,</ital>

<ital>they looked backwards.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>When I looked at the mirror ad,</ital>

<ital>I was seeing me as I see myself</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught</ital>

<ital>there was something beautiful about that.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Intimate, almost.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Of course you like this ad.

When you look at it

you see <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat, I see an old turtle.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">"Hello</name>, old turtle. Are you <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat?

No? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're just some old turtle?

</line>


<line>
-What the hell? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've aged terribly."

-But you've got the heart of a champion.

</line>


<line>
I got a team of cardiologists at <name type="PERSON">Cedars</name>

</line>


<line>
Isn't that the point of the movie,

that anybody could be <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he point of the movie is to make

a lot of money and win awards.

</line>


<line>
If anyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> looks at this ad

is <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat,

why s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld you win the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>?

</line>


<line>
He's right, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>. Why don't you

leave this to the experts, okay?

<line>
-Yes. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a star.

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Closer]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<ital>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</ital>

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Yeah, couple times.</ital>

<ital>We have a very complicated relationship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's complicated.

</line>


<line>
If our relationship was a <name type="PERSON">Meryl</name> <name type="ORG">Streep</name>

</line>


<line>
Don't forget, you have <ital><name type="PERSON">Ellen</name></ital> tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

</line>


<line>
Yes. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're in charge.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you know, I gotta say

I don't feel like I'm in charge.

</line>


<line>
If you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> throw a tantrum,

forget the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing.

</line>


<line>
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we

having sex in my car?

</line>


<line>
-Can we at least go back to your place?

-No, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>

<line>
Better question:

Why am I still getting the <ital>L.A. <name type="PERSON">Gaz</name>ette?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do you think getting the paper every day

is a reminder of <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's papier-mâché head?

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he project he abandoned</ital>

<ital>to make time for the old girlfriend</ital>

<ital>you spent an intimate night with?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Could that be why you want

to cancel your subscription?

</line>


<line>
No. I want to cancel my subscription

because newspapers are dumb.

</line>


<line>
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

</line>


<line>
Every morning,

someone knocks on my door and says,

</line>

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hrow away this <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rbage for me."

-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?

-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

</line>


<line>
No, because then I'll hear the

"psst, psst, psst."

</line>


<line>
And I'll be up all night

wondering what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what would we be talking about?

What? But the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le point

But you don't need me anymore.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le team of coders,

What did he do this time?

I don't think

I've been a very good friend to you.

I don't think <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s been

It might be worth something someday.

No, I know that it's exciting

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a conclusion

I came to recently by myself.

</line>


<line>
I can't do this now.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me tonight.

I want to sleep in your bed,

I wanna see what

you look like waking up.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are a beautiful,

sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

And I want to know you.

I'm not afraid of that.

And you don't have to be, either.

Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad

for my movie to be interpretable.

If you stand where I'm standing,

you see a reflection

of the KIIS-FM billboard.
