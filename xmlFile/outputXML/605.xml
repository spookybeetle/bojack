  <title>A Little Uneven, Is All - <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name></title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
In my line of work,

I meet a lot of big names.

</line>


<line>
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:

<name type="PERSON">Nick Nolte</name>. <name type="PERSON">Mickey</name> Rourke...

</line>


<line>
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

and these are the guys

we think are sexy, right?

</line>


<line>
And my daughter couldn't care less.

</line>


<line>
But when I told her

I was meeting <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>...

</line>


<line>
Do me a favor. Make her day.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Angela</name> Diaz,

head of the network, calls me,

working schmuck, <name type="PERSON">Danny</name> Bananas,

and says, "<name type="PERSON">Danny</name>, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name> is leavin',

and I want you to run <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, here's me, thinking,

"What an opportunity

to write for the most finely-calibrated

ensemble cast on television!"

</line>


<line>
It's like a bowling alley

with you people.

</line>


<line>
Setting up pins and knocking them down.

I should be so lucky.

</line>


<line>
-Uh.

-I know it's no secret

that you and <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> had some friction,

and he left the show

under not-great circumstances.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...

this is your house,

and I'm a guest, all right?

</line>


<line>
The magic of <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

is not <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name> or <name type="PERSON">Danny</name> Bananas.

</line>


<line>
I know why people buy the Big Mac.

I'm not here to change the recipe.

</line>


<line>
You're the special sauce, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

</line>


<line>
And not even the top or the bottom bun.

I'm fine being the middle bun.

</line>


<line>
-You already told me this story.

-I did?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Danny</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>. The buns.

We've been over it.

</line>


<line>
-Well, did I tell you about <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-And <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

-Multiple times. Yes.

</line>


<line>
-What about the time I sneezed on <name type="PERSON">Marisa</name>?

-You've told me everything.

</line>


<line>
You told me about that dream

where you go to a dinner party.

</line>


<line>
I even went down

that strange detour with you

about the three-nippled woman in

the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

</line>


<line>
-Who was she?

-I think we're done here.

</line>


<line>
-What do you mean, done?

-Well, you've been here six months.

</line>


<line>
It's time to go home.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Shannon</name>]</nonVerbComm> Oh, sorry. Uh, not this way.

</line>


<line>
My boss is gonna kill me

if I don't deliver these flowers

to his mistress.

</line>


<line>
Well, we're filming

an episode of <ital>Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>,</ital>

and my boss is gonna kill me

if I let anyone through.

</line>


<line>
Great, when they discover my remains

scattered in the bramble of <name type="PERSON">Griffith</name> Park,

</line>


<line>
my loved ones will take solace

knowing I died

</line>


<line>
so they could shoot an episode

of <ital>Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

</line>


<line>
I know I couldn't always be there for you,

birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

</line>


<line>
I'd like to be your Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>.

</line>


<line>
You really don't get it, do you?

This is the real world, okay?

</line>


<line>
And I'm a career gal.

I don't have time for birthdays.

</line>


<line>
But what about the birthday spirit?

</line>


<line>
Everyone knows there's no such thing.

This is the real world.

</line>


<line>
Now, if you'll excuse me,

I need to drink my coffee.

</line>


<line>
-Cut. Let's move on.

-[bell rings]

</line>


<line>
Great take, <name type="PERSON">Melodie</name>. Chills.

</line>


<line>
Are we <name type="PERSON">Glenn Close</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Jeff</name> Goldblum, <name type="PERSON">Kevin</name> Kline,

</line>


<line>
and all of the greatest <name type="ORG">Motown</name> singles

collected on one...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles] "Big Chills."

-Hot herbal tea?

</line>


<line>
-Yes, that would be-- Ooh!

-Ha!

</line>


<line>
-Oops.

-[chuckles] Got me again, <name type="PERSON">Audrey</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Donna</name>, we're gonna need another scarf.

</line>


<line>
Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?

</line>


<line>
No, what they're turned onto

is hating me...

</line>


<line>
on account of I cheated on <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ever since the story went viral,

</line>


<line>
the public has really mashed

the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

</line>


<line>
-Especially young women.

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
"Especially young women"

is one of our show's eight target demos.

</line>


<line>
We gotta juice your Q!

</line>


<line>
Right now, the only juice

I'm interested in is <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>' juice

</line>


<line>
and making things kosher between us,

which is a task I relish.

</line>


<line>
-So, you wanna have sex with me?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
And your fianc√©

is gonna be in there watching, or...

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

</line>


<line>
This is not a fetish-based

cuckolding scenario.

</line>


<line>
He had sex with his ex, so to level

the playing field now, we have to boink,

so Mister and I can be even

and everything can go back to normal.

</line>


<line>
You understand?

</line>


<line>
Not really,

but I get to have sex with you?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Correct.

</line>


<line>
Then, cool. I'm in.

</line>


<line>
-But what about your reputation?

-I'm not too worried about it.

</line>


<line>
I feel like people

generally want to like me.

</line>


<line>
And if I just don't do anything,

eventually, the universe will realign

and the public will go back

to loving me again.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.

-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

</line>


<line>
Not everyone appreciates

the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

</line>


<line>
-Are you starting your memoir today?

-That was the plan.

</line>


<line>
But I got these dishes now.

That'll take all morning.

</line>


<line>
And once the morning's over,

basically the whole day is shot, you know?

</line>


<line>
Better to start clean tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Look, I know it's hard

to start a new thing,

but the hardest part is starting.

</line>


<line>
You're right.

</line>


<line>
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman

who pays child support,

so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[indistinct chattering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone?

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to raise

a non-alcoholic toast to <name type="PERSON">Denise</name>.

</line>


<line>
-[laughter]

-Ha-ha!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Ow! My gluten intolerance!

</line>


<line>
We've all been through so much together,

and it's never easy to say goodbye.

</line>


<line>
-Remember when <name type="PERSON">Doug</name> left?

-[all] Hmm?

</line>


<line>
-Or <name type="PERSON">Jameson</name>?

-[all muttering]

</line>


<line>
Or sweet, sweet Bongo?

</line>


<line>
-Sorry, who are we talking about?

-To <name type="PERSON">Denise</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Denise</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize

we're the last of our original group.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">God</name>, we had some good times, huh?

-I mean, no, mostly.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?

-Ready or not, here I go.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you're ready.

</line>


<line>
Have you given any thought

to what we discussed yesterday?

</line>


<line>
About you transitioning to a version

of yourself that is no longer here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

Things are kinda working for me.

</line>


<line>
Staying out of trouble,

got the fancy room,

finally perfected

my egg-white omelet order.

</line>


<line>
The secret is egg yellows.

I might do another six weeks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> You've already re-upped

three times.

</line>


<line>
This place is for people in crisis.

</line>


<line>
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.

Right, Karmen?

</line>


<line>
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?

-Karmen, no.

</line>


<line>
You sold your baby to a den of leeches

to pay for crack.

</line>


<line>
-The leeches have your baby now.

-Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
Ah. Classic Karm.

</line>


<line>
It's natural to be hesitant.

</line>


<line>
When I first checked out of rehab,

I was terrified.

</line>


<line>
I knew a single drop of alcohol

would send me down a ruinous path.

</line>


<line>
-But I found my way.

-Found your way back to rehab.

</line>


<line>
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.

-"Our"?

</line>


<line>
A lot of people leave this place,

and I think, "They're not gonna make it."

Like <name type="PERSON">Denise</name>, for example.

</line>


<line>
But you?

You've done the work, and you're ready.

</line>


<line>
You're a special case, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I am?

-Of course you are.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Sharona</name>]</nonVerbComm><ital> Oh, boy,</ital>

<ital>did he do a number on you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He was actually very nice.

You know, I want things to be easy on set.

</line>


<line>
And I think <name type="PERSON">Danny</name>

represents a fresh start.

</line>


<line>
-Is that why you got <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> fired?

-Hey, I'm not the one who--

</line>


<line>
I can't do your hair

if you're gonna move your head so much.

</line>


<line>
There was nothing I could do about <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
If it wasn't for me,

they would've canceled the whole show.

</line>


<line>
And then where would you go?

</line>


<line>
Who's gonna hire

a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?

</line>


<line>
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.

-Be sure to put that on your r√©sum√©.

</line>


<line>
You're just bitter because I'm the only

person who can drink as much as you do.

</line>


<line>
-[giggles]

-<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name>!

</line>


<line>
-Here comes the airplane...

-[tires screech]

</line>


<line>
-[car crashes]

-Oh, a kerfuffle!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[people clamoring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey! What's going on out there?

</line>


<line>
An ice cream truck

crashed into the root beer factory!

</line>


<line>
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

</line>


<line>
-Five people are dead!

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
And there's worse to come,

unless somebody can slurp up

all that ice cream!

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'd love to help slurp,

but I just started a new nannying job.

</line>


<line>
I don't care!

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
Wow, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> leaving rehab.

</line>


<line>
-Truly the end of an era.

-[crying]

</line>


<line>
Sobby <name type="PERSON">Bobby</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Gonna</name> miss your excessive crying.

</line>


<line>
Can't believe it.

</line>


<line>
Last time I'm gonna stop

at this vending machine.

</line>


<line>
What do you say, B-7?

One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">Whew</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow. Hello, the public.

</line>


<line>
Didn't think I'd have to address this

so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

</line>


<line>
-Yes, I, <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>, went to rehab--

-Uh, keep it moving.

</line>


<line>
We wanna get a clean shot

for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion

disrupter Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name> shows up.

</line>


<line>
-Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>?

-Yeah, he's checking in today.

</line>


<line>
-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.

-Fancy room?

</line>


<line>
He's gettin' the fancy room.

</line>


<line>
-It's time to go home.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Ready or not.

</line>


<line>
I got the fancy room.

</line>


<line>
He's gettin' the fancy room.

</line>


<line>
You're a special case, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.

</line>


<line>
What does it all mean?

</line>


<line>
Sounds like they're kicking you out

to make room for Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>.

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
Sounds like they're kicking you out

to make room for Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
I think they're kicking me out

to make room for Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>.

</line>


<line>
I just feel like if I knew

the source of my addiction,

everything else would just click together.

</line>


<line>
-Playtime's over.

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

</line>


<line>
-What the hell? This is my time.

-Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Brad</name>.

</line>


<line>
The source of your addiction

is wanting to impress your old babysitter

who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

</line>


<line>
She's dead. You're free.

</line>


<line>
No, that's not...

</line>


<line>
Oh. Oh...

</line>


<line>
I thought you were checking out.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.

</line>


<line>
Well, check this out.

</line>


<line>
BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...

</line>


<line>
What is he doing?

</line>


<line>
I think he's trying to get out a zinger.

We better let him finish.

</line>


<line>
You have to imagine that I just said it.

</line>


<line>
It's only funny

if it feels extemporaneous.

</line>


<line>
Don't waste your breath setting it up,

just say the thing.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you start over?

-Check this out.

</line>


<line>
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>?

</line>


<line>
That's a no-go, bro.

</line>


<line>
Worth it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[car horns blaring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. Please, go around.

</line>


<line>
I worked on it all night.

The thing that's gonna save your career.

</line>


<line>
Ha!

</line>


<line>
-What is it?

-It's a meme! For posting online!

</line>


<line>
Teacher gave you too much homework?

"Sad Dog!"

</line>


<line>
Your favorite sports outfit

lost the match? "Sad Dog!"

</line>


<line>
People are gonna love it.

And that love will transfer to you.

</line>


<line>
But I'm not a sad dog.

I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

</line>


<line>
-So, it needs some massaging.

-[phone rings]

</line>


<line>
Hold on, I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!"

See how easy it is?

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>! How was your date with <name type="PERSON">Carl</name>?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, Mister.

</line>


<line>
The sex was good, like, really good,

but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

</line>


<line>
Don't beat yourself up about that.

You just met the guy.

</line>


<line>
But part of the betrayal

of you sleeping with <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>

is the fact that you share

an intimate history.

</line>


<line>
If we're really trying to even things out,

I don't think <name type="PERSON">Carl</name> counts.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have

to keep having sex with people

until you find someone with whom you have

an emotional connection.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> That might be a lot of guys,

but if that's what it's gonna take

to save our marriage,

</line>


<line>
I will keep riding the express train

to bone-town until that happens.

</line>


<line>
That's my girl.

</line>


<line>
-Oh! Thank you.

-[phone ringing]

</line>


<line>
-[beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
Hey, it's <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, I thought I heard

retired dads in the distance,

praising the '95 <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> Bulls.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you could give me some advice.

I'm writing a new book,

but I shouldn't even get started

until I sell it to a publisher, right?

</line>


<line>
-What is it?

-I'm still in the loose idea phase.

</line>


<line>
Half essay, half memoir.

</line>


<line>
The working title is

</line>


<line>
<ital>One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to <name type="PERSON">God</name></ital>

<ital>I'll Shut Up About This Forever:</ital>

</line>


<line>

<ital>of the Choices We Make,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>People We Hurt,</ital>

<ital>The Places We Go: Part One.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wait, how is it part one if it's

definitive? I'm getting another call.

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
Hi, while you were blabbering on,

</line>


<line>
I had our lit assistant

take care of everything.

</line>


<line>
A navel-gazey book of observations.

Sounds fun.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>No, I--</ital>

-I sold it. You have six months.

</line>


<line>
Enjoy the process.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wha...

</line>


<line>
What happened?

You're packing your things backwards.

</line>


<line>
What happened is you said I was special.

</line>


<line>
You gave a whole spiel

 just trying to get rid of me

to make room

for a high-profile new client.

</line>


<line>
I thought we'd made strides

on your jealousy issues.

</line>


<line>
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

</line>


<line>
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely

seen it written out as "spiel."

</line>


<line>
I think it's spelled "spiel,"

but it's pronounced "shpeel."

</line>


<line>
Not now, Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

I was told I was in the fancy room?

</line>


<line>
We're moving some things around.

Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
Oh, tomorrow is jammed.

</line>


<line>
I'm shootin' a video

for my new single, "Lace Up,"

which is spon-con

for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.

</line>


<line>
-Could we just do it now, real quick?

-You wanna do rehab real quick?

</line>


<line>
Life is precious. <name type="PERSON">God</name> is religious,

or merely the idea of human connection.

</line>


<line>
Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.

</line>


<line>
Powerful stuff.

Feels like I just got a new lease on life.

</line>


<line>
Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.

</line>


<line>
That's the problem. When you say it

in here, it all sounds easy.

</line>


<line>
But I know that out there,

it's hard and confusing.

</line>


<line>
-And it's just-- I-I don't...

-But you're not alone.

</line>


<line>
You have a wonderful support system.

</line>


<line>
Think of all your amazing friends

just waiting to love you as you love them.

<line>
-Hey, buddy.

-Hey, listen, I'm...

</line>


<line>
You're probably wondering about Georgette,

</line>


<line>
-the newest member of Team <name type="PERSON">Chavez</name>.

-Nope.

</line>


<line>
Since I've started

taking care of <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> full-time,

that hasn't given me a lot of time

for regular <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> business,

and stuff's been falling

through the cracks.

</line>


<line>
So, you hired an assistant?

</line>


<line>
Well, yes, but assistants

are like <ital>Deadpool</ital> movies.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't just stop at one,

even though I probably should have.

</line>


<line>
Now I have 12.

</line>


<line>
You hired 12 assistants? To assist <ital>you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yep, I've got <name type="PERSON">Bella</name>

trying out new goofy dances,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pedro</name>'s monitoring

all the Five Guys franchises

to make sure each one

has the right number of guys,

</line>


<line>
-and <name type="PERSON">Silvia</name>'s in charge of checking...

-[clock ringing]

</line>


<line>
-...All About That Ace every 15 minutes.

-What is "All About That Ace?"

</line>


<line>
My asexual dating app.

I think I might be the only one on it.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> giggles]

-But another ace could join any day now.

</line>


<line>
And when that happens, two of a kind.

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess that makes about

as much sense as the rest of it.

</line>


<line>
Listen, um, I might be getting out

of rehab soon...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, that's fantastic!

</line>


<line>
...and I wanted to talk to you

because I, uh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
...can't do this by myself.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got you, buddy.

You just wait one jiffy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Ah!

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Casey</name>, the assistant.

<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> hired me to be your friend.

</line>


<line>
Okay, that's, uh, you know...

I think I'm good. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
He said I would be perfect for you

because you could be mean to me

and you wouldn't feel bad,

because you're paying me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

</line>


<line>
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be

very discreet, whatever you need.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Marc Cherry</name> used to dress me

in the outfit <name type="PERSON">Natalie</name> Wood drowned in

and scream at me for hours on end.

</line>


<line>
It was very therapeutic for him,

and I didn't mind

because he wasn't screaming at me,

he was screaming at death.

</line>


<line>
Stars really are just like us, huh?

</line>


<line>
-Do you mind if I have a sip?

-Don't drink that!

</line>


<line>
Right, of course.

I must earn hydration. So sorry.

</line>


<line>
No, it's just... that's vodka.

</line>


<line>
You think it's a good idea

to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

</line>


<line>
Because it is if you think it is.

</line>


<line>
It's not for drinking.

</line>


<line>
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.

As a reminder, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Of what?

-Are you almost done?

</line>


<line>
I need <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name> to work that magic

on her mane man.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.

Cool your jets.

</line>


<line>
Why can't you do this

in <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s dressing room?

</line>


<line>
My stepdad's in there,

and he's being weird.

</line>


<line>
-Why is that my problem?

-We appreciate your hospitality.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

what do you think of the new guy?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Danny</name>? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

</line>


<line>
-I miss <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

-We all do, sweetie.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>. <name type="PERSON">Danny</name>. What difference does it make?

We got a job to do, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying I miss him.

</line>


<line>
And I'm just saying

it's not my fault he got fired.

</line>


<line>
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.

-I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Nobody said it was your fault.

</line>


<line>
I actually think

<name type="PERSON">Danny</name> represents an opportunity.

</line>


<line>
For a new beginning.

</line>


<line>
You don't think it feels weird

to do the show without <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
If <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> really cared about the show,

maybe he shouldn't have...

</line>


<line>
What? Been gay?

</line>


<line>
No, that's not-- Obviously...

</line>


<line>
-I put my ass on the line for you people.

-Ugh. <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?

<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> was gonna throw that all away.

</line>


<line>
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

</line>


<line>
-I... I don't know.

-<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, she's ten!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, which is basically an adult

in Hollywood years.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to make this situation work.

Enjoy my dressing room.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Hey, I know you feel shitty,

but don't take it out on a little girl.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> I don't feel shitty,

I feel great!

</line>


<line>
Okay. You know why this is here, <name type="PERSON">Casey</name>?

</line>


<line>
It's because I think I'm special

and the rules don't apply to me.

</line>


<line>
And I keep thinking that

over and over again.

</line>


<line>
-Well, you are special.

-No, shut up.

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

</line>


<line>
All your bosses are assholes.

And people like you indulge us.

</line>


<line>
And you soothe our egos,

and you let us abuse you.

</line>


<line>
-You're right, I'm terrible.

-No, <name type="PERSON">God</name> damn it. That's not my point.

</line>


<line>
Have some respect for yourself.

</line>


<line>
Okay, sorry.

I'm just happy to be a part of things.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
Can you run downstairs

and grab me some Funyuns?

</line>


<line>
-Mm... No.

-What do you mean, no?

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what's happening?

-There's an "I" in "assistants."

</line>


<line>
And this time, the "I" is us.

</line>


<line>
I like your energy, but what?

</line>


<line>
And lo and behold,

my sandwich has onions...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
...when I specifically meant

to tell you I didn't want onions.

</line>


<line>
Where are you going?

</line>


<line>
-So, this lawyer's got attitude.

-[phone buzzes]

</line>


<line>
And that attitude? Autism.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand,

why is this person moving now?

</line>


<line>
Wait! What's goin' on?

</line>


<line>
The Hollywoo Assistants are unionizing.

This is a walk-out.

</line>


<line>
No! I've grown too dependent on you!

</line>


<line>
I can't perform

basic <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> functions anymore!

</line>


<line>
I'm like a toddler, but a <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> version.

A Toddler!

</line>


<line>
I know you got a job to do,

but is there any way...

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-...Joey <name type="PERSON">Pogo</name> could get through?

</line>


<line>
Just got out of rehab.

I'm trying to get home.

</line>


<line>
-Knock yourself out.

-All right!

</line>


<line>
Don't die on me, <name type="PERSON">Ileanna</name>.

Not on your birthday, of all days!

</line>


<line>
Year after year,

the only thing I wished for was a dad.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobs]</nonVerbComm> And now you're here,

and it's like...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[coughs]</nonVerbComm> ...paging Dr. Birthday!

</line>


<line>
But if you just told me your wish,

that means it won't come true!

</line>


<line>
You really don't get it, do you?

It already has. [gasps]

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Ah! Buddy, what the hell are you doing?

Get out of the way!

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-I saw the whole thing.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I'm a sad dog,"

and jumped right in front of the car.

</line>


<line>
I think he's a really sad dog, you guys.

You know, like the meme.

</line>


<line>
-[all gasping]

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I had no idea.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, life is precious.

That's something you hear a lot in rehab.

</line>


<line>
Hey, why'd you try to kill yourself,

you stupid idiot?

</line>


<line>
-Um...

-I'm no psychiatrist,

but it's probably because

he's such a sad dog!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Mr. Peanutbutter,

we didn't realize

you have a mental illness.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for getting the word out

about depression.

</line>


<line>
You are truly a hero for destigmatizing

this all-too-common affliction.

</line>


<line>
Yes, a hero!

</line>


<line>
And to see more of this hero in action,

tune in to <ital>Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name></ital> this spring

on MBN!

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I think I sing

for everyone when I say...

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>‚ô™ Don't hurt yourself, we love you ‚ô™</music></ital>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all cheering]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
Oh, so I guess this all worked out.

</line>


<line>
-Huh?

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Depressingly, that is.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[truck beeping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I saw your new assistant leave.

 Why aren't you packed?

</line>


<line>
I can't. Please don't make me.

</line>


<line>
-You don't know what I'm like out there.

-Let's find out.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, that's--

-I won't coddle this anymore.

</line>


<line>
You're scared? Good.

Go to AA meetings. Go to a psychiatrist.

</line>


<line>
But what pisses me off

is when you take a bed that someone else

could be using to get better.

</line>


<line>
Isn't it possible

 I'm one of those people

that would benefit

from staying here indefinitely?

</line>


<line>
No. You're not that special.

</line>


<line>
And you don't belong here anymore.

Pack your things.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Sorry. I was just kind of in it, you know?

</line>


<line>
Yeah? It's going good?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you were right.

Once I got started, it was easy.

</line>


<line>
So much of my career has been

writing for and about other people,

and how terrible everything is.

</line>


<line>
It's actually really refreshing

to just focus on myself, you know?

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't want to interrupt your flow.

Please, write on.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Doctor Champ]</nonVerbComm> Oh, this is a fine

how do you do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Brad</name> was like, "It's difficult to have

a hot name but not be that hot."

</line>


<line>
Can you believe that?

He's extremely attractive, no?

</line>


<line>
-I don't...

-And honestly, is <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> a hot name?

</line>

But like, name one other handsome <name type="PERSON">Brad</name>.

You're gonna spend the night here

it's easy sober, hmm?

Bad news about the Manzanita lawsuit.

You think he'll settle?

</line>

Settle? Manzanita?

I'd say that's about as likely

as my daughter <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> skipping school

and sneaking into the office with me

in my work luggage!

Listen, you're doing great.

Slight change of plans, though.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> had to go home early.

So, we need to change the episode

to being about you

<ital>not </ital>bringing <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> to the office.

</line>


<line>
Is she okay?

</line>


<line>
Uh, only reason I'm telling you this

is you're my main guy here,

and I know you want

what's best for everyone.

</line>


<line>
-Of course.

-<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> got her hands on some alcohol.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-Her mother is apoplectic.

</line>


<line>
She wants to sue.

</line>


<line>
I think it's just big talk,

but someone needs to be held accountable.

</line>


<line>
And as the guys in charge here,

we're responsible

for figuring out who that's gonna be.

</line>


<line>
-What are you...

-I need you to be straight with me.

</line>


<line>
-That wasn't your alcohol, right?

-Oh, I don't...

</line>


<line>
It wasn't, right?

</line>


<line>
Because if it was,

we're all in real trouble.

</line>


<line>
-You get what I'm saying.

-Y-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
So, you don't know

where she got the alcohol from?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I have no idea.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't look at me.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Nothing. Just a little uneven, is all.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I'm screwed. I'm so screwed.

</line>


<line>
-It's gonna be okay.

-No!

</line>


<line>
I'm drunk. Not okay.

You can't let anyone know about this.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="GPE">Shush</name>!

-Yeah. Shh.

</line>


<line>
You gotta stay with me until I sober up.

I can't be alone here like this.

</line>


<line>
It's okay, I'm here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, be here.

You need to stay here, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.
