</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Okay, how about this one?</ital>

</line>


<line>
BoJack swallowed a dozen

pastries in the time it took

the caterer

to <name type="ORG">un</name>wrap a fruit tray.

</line>


<line>
When she asked where

the pastries had gone,

</line>


<line>
BoJack claimed he had no idea,

spraying her with

bits of buttery crust?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

I did that once.

</line>


<line>
Oh, but with holiday cookies.

</line>


<line>
I had sprinkles

all over my sweater.

</line>


<line>
See?

People respond

to the flawed portrait

I painted of you.

</line>


<line>
They see themselves in it.

</line>


<line>
Why do you love <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat?

</line>


<line>
Uh, because he was awesome?

</line>


<line>
No, because he was flawed.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, when people find

out that someone like you,

who seems larger than life,

is actually just as wo<name type="ORG">un</name>ded

and vulnerable as they are,

it makes them feel less lonely.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, no!

Maybe that's what flawed,

sad fatties want

from other celebrities,

but for BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,

they want a heroic horse-stud

who is awesome

and who can save them from

their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

</line>


<line>
- You're so wrong.

- Actually, you know what?

</line>


<line>
Now that I think about it,

I think that you're so wrong!

</line>


<line>
Listen, we all agree

Diane broke contract

by leaking

the first two chapters,

but the response

has been amazing!

</line>


<line>
People want to read more,

and we have to

get this to the printers

by the end of the week,

because that's when

the repo men are coming

to take away our printers.

</line>


<line>
The end of the week?

No!

</line>


<line>
Okay, what if I told you

that I could have

a new book for you by then?

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Yeah, a better one.

</line>


<line>
Better stories,

better told, by me--

straight from the horse's mouth.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna write

a whole book in five days?

</line>


<line>
When's the last time

you even read a book?

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Firm</ital>, by John Grisham?

</line>


<line>
Oh, do you think

what you do is so hard?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whining]</nonVerbComm>

"Oh, I'm a writer.

</line>


<line>
I go to coffee shops

with my laptop and my notebook

and my dumb glasses

that I have to wear,

because I'm so important

I need to see clearly."

</line>


<line>
Well, I wish you

the best of luck.

</line>


<line>
You know what

your problem is?

</line>


<line>
You think you're so much

smarter than everybody.

</line>


<line>
Well, guess what.

</line>


<line>
I spent as much time with you

as you did with me.

</line>


<line>
Why don't I write a book about

how you married Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>

because he's too dumb to see how

much better you think you are?

</line>


<line>
- Okay, I know you're upset--

- I'm not upset.

</line>


<line>
I'm just sick of nerd-girls like

you beating up on stars like me.

</line>


<line>
It's pathetic!

I'm sorry no one wanted

to date you

in high school, Diane,

but I don't see why I have

to suffer just because

you were never especially

pretty or interesting.

</line>


<line>
You really let me down,

BoJack.

</line>


<line>
You really let me down.

</line>


<line>
I apologize for her outbursts.

</line>


<line>
So, you really think you could

write a better book by Friday?

</line>


<line>
Damn right I can, so you

can throw this turd of a book

in the garbage and then

light the garbage on fire.

</line>


<line>
In fact, you can burn all books,

because my book,

written by me,

is gonna kick your dick off.

- Okay, chapter one.

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Not quite right.

</line>


<line>
- Huh.

- [cell phone vibrating]

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Why are you rewriting

the book, bozo?

</line>


<line>
Diane's version is great.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna lose

gems like this one...

</line>


<line>
Ahem. "The only

longstanding relationship

</line>


<line>
in BoJack's life is with

his agent, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Her loyalty must come

from a deep-rooted faith

</line>


<line>
that she's talented enough

to sustain the career of a man

society perceives as a joke."

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah, I would say that

I'm not such a fan of that one.

</line>


<line>
Look, all publicity

is good publicity.

</line>


<line>
That guy who killed all those

teachers and ate their fingers?

</line>


<line>
He just got married in jail,

and when this book comes out,

</line>


<line>
you could be that guy.

</line>


<line>
Oh, don't you get it?

</line>


<line>
This is my last chance

to make people love me again.

</line>


<line>
If this goes out, everybody's

gonna see the real me.

</line>


<line>
Now, I spend a lot of time

with the real me,

</line>


<line>
and believe me,

nobody's gonna love that guy.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- Now if you'll excuse me,

</line>


<line>
I need to go take a shower

</line>


<line>
so I can't tell

if I'm crying or not.

</line>


<line>
All right, let's get to work.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[knuckles crack]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I feel like we can

beat this font.

</line>


<line>
Ah, <name type="ORG">Copperplate</name>, a font

for the truly modern man.

</line>


<line>
Ha. No.

</line>


<line>
There you are, <name type="ORG">Verdana</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thought you could hide at the

end of the alphabet, did ya?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="ORG">Comic Sans</name>,

you dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k, go home.

</line>


<line>
3:10?

I just spent six hours

playing with fonts?

Holy shit!

</line>


<line>
Okay, focus BoJack, focus.

</line>


<line>
Here comes the focus.

</line>


<line>
Well, this can't be that hard.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane's voice]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>BoJack often felt the need</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>to impress me</ital>

<ital>with material items.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You can see from the teeny,

tiny brush strokes,

that this is very expensive.

</line>


<line>
The color is, um-- This one they

don't even have a name for,

that's how exclusive it is,

and this--

</line>


<line>
<ital>I wondered where</ital>

<ital>this came from.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>There were two</ital>

<ital>obvious suspects.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>His mother <name type="ORG">Beatrice</name>,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>heiress to the Sugarman</ital>

<ital>Sugar Cubes fort<name type="ORG">un</name>e</ital>

<line>
<ital>and his working-class father,</ital>

<ital><name type="ORG">Butterscotch</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>who struggled, and often failed,</ital>

<ital>to provide those comforts.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Or, maybe it was</ital>

<ital>something even--</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Todd! Todd!

- What? What?

</line>


<line>
Eyeballs here-- Look at me.

Look at me!

</line>


<line>
I need to work.

I can't afford to be distracted.

</line>


<line>
- Don't distract me.

- Fine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[paper rustles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, Jesus, Todd!

</line>


<line>
- Read louder much?

- Sorry.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure, just drop

Toaster Strudel crumbs

all over the floor,

why don't you?

</line>


<line>
Guess I'll just clean them up

myself, like always.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I can't work like this.

</line>


<line>
Come on, come on, come on,

pick it up, you dumb vacuum.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I do not have time for this.

</line>


<line>
I need to write.

</line>


<line>
What the-- Come on!

Seriously?

You cannot be seriou--

What did I do?

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Just need something

to help me focus.

<line>
Coffee.

No, no.

Cigarettes.

No, tequila!

<line>
Sarah Lynn, I know things

got kind of out of hand

last time when I tried to

make you stop doing drugs.

</line>


<line>
So I just want to thank you

for coming over this time

to give me drugs.

</line>


<line>
Well, you can't go wrong

with Dr. Hu's drugs.

</line>


<line>
They're from another dimension.

</line>


<line>
These are gonna help me

focus and get work done, right?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes. These are what

I give college students

so when they come to, their term

papers have written themselves.

</line>


<line>
That's exactly what he needs.

</line>


<line>
Also, I should probably

do another one.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's "Hu."

Dr. Hu.

</line>


<line>
That's right, Dr. Hu.

Dr. Allen Hu.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, but I thought

it was "Who," like <ital>Doctor Who.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yes, that's exactly

what it's like.

</line>


<line>
No, not <name type="ORG">H-U</name>, but, "who,"

like, <name type="ORG">"Hello</name>, who is it?"

</line>


<line>
Uh, I don't know.

Who is it?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, is this a joke?

Is he telling a joke

</line>


<line>
- that I just don't--

- Hard to tell.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes I just laugh after he

talks so he'll leave me alone.

</line>


<line>
Seriously? Am I the only one

who knows the extremely popular

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">BB</name>C science fiction show about

the time traveling doctor

</line>


<line>
- who saves civilizations?

- Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're

talking about-- <ital>Doctor Who.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Yes?

- No.

</line>


<line>
- Yes, thank you. <ital>Doctor Who.</ital>

- Yes?

</line>


<line>
I saw the one where

she goes to <name type="LOC">the Wild West</name>.

</line>


<line>
The <name type="GPE">Cheyenne</name> called her

<name type="ORG">Medicine Woman</name>.

</line>


<line>
What?

No, that's Dr. Quinn.

</line>


<line>
- Who's Dr. Quinn?

- I most certainly am not.

</line>


<line>
Hu's not Dr. Quinn.

Hu's Dr. Hu.

</line>


<line>
- I don't know.

- [both] Third base!

</line>


<line>
When are these drugs

going to kick in?

</line>


<line>
Any minute now,

if they haven't already.

</line>


<line>
I want you to take three

of these every hour

and take two of these

every 1/2 hour.

</line>


<line>
Whatever you do, don't take

more than four of these

every 90 minutes, and take

the first two of the three

before you take

the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond two of the four.

</line>


<line>
And don't expose yourself

to bright light or get wet.

</line>


<line>
- So... Gremlin rules?

- Exactly!

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm off to perform

child heart surgery.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

Wish me luck.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffs]</nonVerbComm> Ahh.

</line>


<line>
All right, team, focus up.

</line>


<line>
We got a book to write.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah.

Oh, my God, this is so good.

</line>


<line>
It's good.

</line>


<line>
- So good, so good.

- [upbeat eerie music]

</line>


<line>
Okay, Todd, how is it going

with the heartwarming anecdotes?

</line>


<line>
Great! I'm writing

about that time

we officially became

best friends.

</line>


<line>
Nice! Can you change

best to pretty good?

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with

the <ital><name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital> years?

</line>


<line>
Almost done with the story

where <name type="ORG">Hulk</name> Hogan guest starred

and told us to say no to drugs.

</line>


<line>
Great.

Keep typing, monkeys.

</line>


<line>
If only <name type="ORG">Hulk</name> Hogan

could see us now, right?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Because Sarah Lynn said

the thing about <name type="ORG">Hulk</name> Hogan?

</line>


<line>
That was like four hours ago.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, right.

</line>


<line>
- How we doing now?

- Sending.

</line>


<line>
- Just about to send.

- Nice.

</line>


<line>
Okay, this is great.

</line>


<line>
That puts us at 216 pages?

</line>


<line>
Holy shit, that's almost as long

as <ital>The Firm</ital> by John Grisham.

</line>


<line>
And we just needed

to get to 200, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm just gonna keep writing.

</line>


<line>
I got a lot of synapses

firing right now.

</line>


<line>
It's surprisingly literate

and insightful, but still f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's a beach read you can

thumb through in a wing chair.

</line>


<line>
Can't believe Diane

thought this was so hard.

</line>


<line>
"Ow, my fingers are cramping

from all this typing.

</line>


<line>
It's like they're

having their period."

</line>


<line>
Did Diane really say that?

</line>


<line>
No, but my fingers

are cramping.

</line>


<line>
It's like they're having

their period, am I right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Are you just laughing

so I'll leave you alone?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Good one.

</line>


<line>
We just need a way

to end this thing.

</line>


<line>
What should the ending be?

</line>


<line>
Maybe it was <name type="LOC">Earth</name> all along.

</line>


<line>
Not that,

but something like that.

</line>


<line>
Keep thinking.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whinnies]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I got it!

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Sarah's voice]</nonVerbComm> No.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[talking backwards]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Uh... What... Huh--

- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I like your idea better,

BoJack.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Your idea for the ending.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, what'd I say?

- About <name type="GPE">Maine</name>.

</line>


<line>
About how you end up in <name type="GPE">Maine</name>.

</line>


<line>
I like the part where you swim

in the lake in the summers.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, right, and when I get

too old to take care of myself,

</line>


<line>
I go for one last swim.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I know I can't make it</ital>

<ital>back to shore.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm too weak, too tired.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So I just let the water</ital>

<ital>take me <name type="ORG">un</name>der.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Eesh! Downer ending.

</line>


<line>
- You got something better?

- Wait a minute.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we don't know

the ending yet

because you haven't lived it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I mean,

if you want to, like, finish

finish the book, then you'd

have to, like, die tonight.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know!

I should murder you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm serious.

</line>


<line>
Think about it.

</line>


<line>
If the little girl

you raised on television

killed you in real life--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

people would eat that shit up.

</line>


<line>
I love it. It's perfect.

We'll sell so many books.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, kill BoJack!

</line>


<line>
- I'm gonna kill you!

- Oh, yes!

</line>


<line>
There it is!

Oh, yeah, gonna get you!

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, no--

</line>


<line>
Ah!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all yelling]</nonVerbComm>

[ominous rock music]

</line>


<line>
Okay, so what did we learn?

</line>


<line>
We learned that if

we're going to do drugs

we should do them at home where

it's safe to do them together,

right, Todd?

</line>


<line>
- No!

- Ahh!

</line>


<line>
Don't worry, guys.

</line>


<line>
I have this g<name type="ORG">un</name> to keep

us safe from intruders.

</line>


<line>
- And each other.

- Wait, wait, wait.

</line>


<line>
Is that just

your g<name type="ORG">un</name>-shaped lighter,

or your lighter-shaped g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Busted!

It's just a lighter.

</line>


<line>
- [g<name type="ORG">un</name>shot]

- [all] Aah!

</line>


<line>
Shit, I guess it's my g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Then what'd I do

with my lighter?

</line>


<line>
And what did I give

to that baby?

</line>


<line>
Ha, I have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>, too.

</line>


<line>
Don't be a Silly Billy.

That's a broom.

</line>


<line>
Wait, am I holding a g<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Todd, are you holding

a g<name type="ORG">un</name> or a broom?

</line>


<line>
I can't tell anymore!

</line>


<line>
I guess we'll just have

to shoot them at each other

at the same time to find out!

</line>


<line>
Okay!

</line>


<line>
Todd, sh-- Oh-- Can I just say--

Todd, Todd, I need you--

</line>


<line>
I need you to shh.

Listen, listen, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Okay, just to be totally clear,

we're shooting each other

to determine whether we're

holding g<name type="ORG">un</name>s or brooms, right?

</line>


<line>
Not because you're still mad

about the whole

me sabotaging you

with the rock opera

and your live stream

and suchety-such?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, shh, shh, okay, Bo?

</line>


<line>
Quiet, quiet,

quiet, quiet.

</line>


<line>
As you know, I was hurt,

but then I realized

that's just how you are.

</line>


<line>
You know, and maybe I just

need to stop expecting you

to be a good person,

so that way, I won't

get hurt when you're not.

</line>


<line>
Oh, o-- Okay.

</line>


<line>
Hey, this isn't fair.

</line>


<line>
I don't have a g<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn is right.

</line>
