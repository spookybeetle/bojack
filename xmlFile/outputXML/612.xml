S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>cking revelations today

about <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man's involvement

</line>


<line>
in the overdose of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>,

</line>


<line>
in an explosive new

"<name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo Reporter" exposé.

</line>


<line>
Is <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> #canceled?

</line>


<line>
#Find-out-tonight

when the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse himself sits down...

</line>


<line>
On "<name type="ORG">Braxby</name> Means Business

with <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>,"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man opens up

in an exclusive interview.

</line>


<line>
For the first time ever,

we'll hear the real story

of the last days of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Paige</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I don't believe it.

</line>


<line>
I left s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>e leather

in six different states

and sp<name type="ORG">un</name> the scoop of my career

all to get sidetracked by a sit-down

with a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond-rate celebrity suck-up.

</line>


<line>
Relax. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur story's clearly

doing something

if they're scrambling

to do damage control so fast.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's just it, Patience,

my sister and lifelong confidante.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese <name type="PERSON">schmooze</name>y charlatans will pour syrup

all over this stack of <name type="ORG">Shinola</name>

and try to tell you it's pancakes.

</line>


<line>
And I'm powerless to prevent it!

</line>


<line>
Don't you have enough dirt

for a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le other story?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know full well

once I become <name type="PERSON">Baxter</name>'s bride,

</line>


<line>
I'm trading board rooms for bedrooms,

watches for swatches

and deadlines for bedtimes.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so then get married and forget

about this <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> story.

</line>


<line>
I mean, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares, right?

</line>


<line>
Patience, you cut to the core

like a classic <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name>.

</line>


<line>
I shall miss making mincemeat

of the misdeeds of mischievous miscreants,

but I must focus on my new mission,

as I transition from miss to missus.

</line>


<line>
Why do you talk like that?

We're from Fresno.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[theme music playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h, they're really hyping up

this <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> interview.

</line>


<line>
I gotta admit I'm kinda curious.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> watch, right?

</line>


<line>
No. I can't waste my energy

getting worked up about that guy, <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>.

</line>


<line>
I've done enough of that.

Like, years of that.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, but it's not like you can just--

-I need to work on my book.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese mall-related mysteries

aren't <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> solve themselves.

</line>


<line>
Spoken like a very emotionally

healthy woman,

productive professional writer

and super-cute girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
We already know what <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> say.

</line>


<line>
He'll admit to everything in the story,

but nothing else.

</line>


<line>
He'll trot out this sad-sack routine,

 everyone will feel bad for him.

</line>


<line>
He'll talk about his addictions.

</line>


<line>
"S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wbiz is awful.

My parents were abusive."

</line>


<line>
He'll say he's changed.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat he's not that guy anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u so<name type="ORG">un</name>d real done with it.

-I am! I'm just saying.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey'll make you feel bad for him,

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut it being too sad...

</line>


<line>
...because too sad is a bring-down.

We wanna s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot for pensive.

</line>


<line>
And this will keep you

from talking with your hands,

which can be construed as aggressive.

</line>


<line>
And whatever you do, don't get defensive!

Don't deny anything, and don't argue.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-Give me a smile.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a! Am I my third favorite

<name type="PERSON">Bruce</name> Springsteen song

</line>


<line>
because I was not "<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>rn in the <name type="GPE">US</name>A"

nor am I "<name type="PERSON">T</name>ougher <name type="PERSON">T</name>han the Rest,"

but I am "Blinded By the Light"!

Nice smile, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Do you need to be here right now?

</line>


<line>
Since your interview is leading

into the season finale of "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>,"

</line>


<line>
I wanted to officially welcome you

to the <name type="ORG">MBN</name> <name type="PERSON">T</name>hursday Night family.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
And to ask if it wouldn't be

too much trouble for you

</line>


<line>
to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut out "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>"

during your interview?

</line>


<line>
-Why would I--

-But only if the interview is going well.

</line>


<line>
If the interview is going poorly,

please do not bring up "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

</line>


<line>
-[baby cooing]

-Hey, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, I-- Oh. <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Getting ready for the interview?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Oh! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've got your work cut out for you,

because people hate you right now.

</line>


<line>
-I'm aware, thank you.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat story... Wow.

</line>


<line>
Really well-written, huh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, the power of the prose

was not the first thing I noticed.

</line>


<line>
Ha<name type="ORG">un</name>ting.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

is it cool if I take tomorrow night off

for a date with <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ude?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, I keep hearing about

this new girlfriend of yours.

</line>


<line>
When do I meet her?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can probably take this part

of the conversation elsewhere.

</line>


<line>
Right this way.

</line>


<line>
We s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld go on a double date

with you and <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> and I are putting our relaysh

on a brief hiate at the mo,

but as soon as she returns

from her work trip...

</line>


<line>
-[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne buzzes]

-Uh, oh!

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, I'm receiving a text message

and it appears we have broken up forever.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be great.

-[exhales] Yeah. Where are we doing this?

</line>


<line>
I got them to take the <name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name></name>" set

out of storage.

</line>


<line>
Why?

</line>


<line>
Because we want the intimacy

and vulnerability of your <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're saying, "<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is me. No more lies."

</line>


<line>
But since we're pre-taping it

in the afternoon,

we're using the set to make it look

like it's nighttime.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>kes sense.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[jingle playing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I'm here with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man

in his actual <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, a story came out this morning

about the last days of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
How did it make you feel?

</line>


<line>
Honestly? I felt relieved

that now I can stop lying.

</line>


<line>
-[light crashes]

-[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-Are the alle<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tions in the story true?

-[clears throat] <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey are.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> was nine months sober.

I invited her on a bender.

</line>


<line>
We spiraled together for a little over

a month and then she overdosed.

</line>


<line>
On heroin you purchased for her?

</line>


<line>
-Well, I didn't purchase it for her--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no need to get defensive.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to be accurate.

</line>


<line>
I-I didn't purchase it at all.

I just had it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just had heroin?

Lying aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, no, not <ital>lying aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[scoffs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're making it so<name type="ORG">un</name>d

like I had extra heroin,

because I do so much heroin.

</line>


<line>
I had that heroin

because I wasn't doing heroin.

</line>


<line>
So, I had it. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand?

</line>


<line>
In your original statement to the police,

you said she called you,

you came to the planetarium and fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d her.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a lie.

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
Would you say <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> dying

was your rock bottom?

</line>


<line>
I don't believe in rock bottoms.

</line>


<line>
I've had a lot of what I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

were rock bottoms only to discover

</line>


<line>
-another rockier bottom <name type="ORG">un</name>derneath.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds dangerous.

</line>


<line>
Eventually, I decided to stop waiting

for something to change me.

</line>


<line>
I had to make the change myself.

And that's why I went to rehab.

</line>


<line>
And I'm very proud to be one year sober

next month.

</line>


<line>
So, if I'm <name type="ORG">un</name>derstanding you correctly,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> dying

was part of that decision?

</line>


<line>
Uh, it was part of it, yes.

Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes.

</line>


<line>
Can you share some of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se

other mistakes?

</line>


<line>
I... I don't think

that it would be fair to the people

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> were affected by t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se mistakes,

all of w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m I've apologized to in private.

</line>


<line>
Now that you're sober,

do you think you'll stop

making these mistakes?

</line>


<line>
I do. It's been a lot of work,

but I look back at that other <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>

and I think, <name type="PERSON">"W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> is that?"

</line>


<line>
And w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> was he?

</line>


<line>
I came from a broken <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

and I used to feel like my w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life

was an acting job.

</line>


<line>
Just doing an impression of the people

I saw on television,

which was just the projection of a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch

of equally screwed-up writers and actors.

</line>


<line>
I felt like a <name type="ORG">Xerox</name> of a <name type="ORG">Xerox</name>

of a person, you know what I mean?

</line>


<line>
-But not anymore?

-No. Now I feel like me.

</line>


<line>
It must have been difficult

to see t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se same patterns

repeat themselves with <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
I think that's why her death

was so scary for me,

why I didn't wanna confront it,

because she reminded me of myself.

</line>


<line>
Some have accused <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s mother

of exploiting her death.

</line>


<line>
When you hear "All <name type="PERSON">T</name>werk and No Play"

in a <name type="ORG">Geico</name> co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ercial,

or see <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s face on a billboard

with the slo<name type="PERSON">ga</name>n "I'd die for a Pepsi,"

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w does that make you feel?

-Sad. Angry.

</line>


<line>
Honestly, it feels like

that's what killed her.

</line>


<line>
Not the heroin?

</line>


<line>
No, you're right.

It was mostly the heroin.

</line>


<line>
If you could talk to her mother now,

what would you say to her?

</line>


<line>
I would say... I wish you could know...

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w sorry I am.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-Am I crazy or did I nail that?

-It was good.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, when she brought up

<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>'s mother?

</line>


<line>
She was setting me up

to throw her <name type="ORG">un</name>der the bus,

but then I said I'm sorry?

</line>


<line>
I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah?

I felt like I could see <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>trix!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've definitely gotten

your 10,000 <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs in

when it comes to apologizing.

</line>


<line>
It was good, right?

People are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> like it?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, we'll find out in three <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs

when it airs.

</line>


<line>
And that's why the band <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>

is not one of the top ten <name type="GPE">Chicago</name> bands

of all time.

</line>


<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>, it's okay

if you wanna watch. All right?

</line>


<line>
He's your friend, it's a big deal for him.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't have to be so weird about it.

-I'm not being weird. I'm in a good place.

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna get dragged back

into that other stuff.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's great! But, you know,

it is a little weird

that one of your best friends

is a huge celebrity

</line>


<line>
-and you never wanna talk about him.

-<name type="PERSON">Roxy</name>'s really more my "best" best friend.

</line>


<line>
But you never talk about <name type="PERSON">Roxy</name> either!

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand what her job is

and it's too late for me to ask.

</line>


<line>
And you were also married

to a huge celebrity.

</line>


<line>
And you never talk about him either.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't share your past life with me.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna talk about weird?

</line>


<line>
I've lived here six months

and I still haven't met your son.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sta<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Okay. But you don't really

wanna meet <name type="PERSON">Son</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
Of course I do!

</line>


<line>
All right, cool.

I was spellbo<name type="ORG">un</name>d!

<line>

</line>


<line>
Uh, small latte?

</line>


<line>
-My manager told me not to charge you.

-What?

</line>


<line>
He said he watched

your interview last night,

then turned off the <name type="PERSON">T</name>V

and went straight

to his first <name type="ORG">AA</name> meeting.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
No "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>."

the best ratings we've seen in years!

of not having to sell ourselves

to a larger media company

I wanna strike while the iron is <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t

and do a part two tonight.

</line>


<line>
-Part two?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here is no part two.

</line>


<line>
It's right there in the title,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Last Days of <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>."

</line>


<line>
Just sit down with <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in

and tell a few more colorful anecdotes

from your years partying in <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>woo.

of the "Birthday <name type="PERSON">Dad</name>" finale.

<line>

<line>
We got what we wanted out of this.

I don't think we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld push it.

I'm helping people.

and go back to <name type="GPE">Connecticut</name>,

but it does feel good to be part

of the conversation a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

about addiction is helping people,

then I'm kind of a dick

if I don't do another interview, right?

</line>


<line>
Speaking of addicts,

I think you're addicted to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told the police

you weren't with her when she died.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat she called you from the planetarium.

</line>


<line>
Yes, I lied.

</line>


<line>
Weren't you afraid the police would check

the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne records?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly.

Guess I'm not a criminal mastermind!

</line>


<line>
But the police did check

the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne records,

and your story checked out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was a two-minute p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne call

made from her p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne to your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne,

</line>


<line>
17 minutes before you called 911.

</line>


<line>
-Oh?

-If you were with her,

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you explain the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne call?

-I, um...

</line>


<line>
I called myself.

</line>


<line>
After I realized what had had happened,

I took her p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne and I called myself

so I could make it look like

she called me.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-I went into panic mode.

</line>


<line>
And then what did you do?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught we were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> talk

about other stuff.

</line>


<line>
What did you do after you called

your own p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
I went outside to the parking lot.

</line>


<line>
And you just waited there for 17 minutes?

</line>


<line>
Why are you asking about this?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Paige</name> <name type="ORG">Sinclair</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been had.

</line>


<line>
A pleasure to meet you. Had by w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he pleasure is mine,

the prono<name type="ORG">un</name> is w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m,

and the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m is the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>? I got him to spill his guts

about the worst moment of his life

</line>


<line>
on national television for huge ratings.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur disgusting display

of soft-pedaling sycophancy

made me wanna quit

the journalism business altogether,

two days prior to when I get married

and quit the journalism

business altogether.

</line>


<line>
But the <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name> brand

is keeping things light.

</line>


<line>
Celebs come on my s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

because I make 'em look good.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat access keeps me relevant.

</line>


<line>
But to what benefit is your relevance

if it's squandered

in the service of public relations?

</line>


<line>
With the advent of social media,

celebs don't need you

to make them look good.

</line>


<line>
And if you don't alter your strategy soon,

you'll have no career left to save.

</line>


<line>
Face it, chin<name type="PERSON">chill</name>a, you're all wet.

</line>


<line>
Well, I...

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hitting

interview, what would I say?

</line>


<line>
I've a few ideas...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u keep looking over to your manager.

-Well, I--

</line>


<line>
-Can we talk about your relationship?

-Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u dated her for seven years?

-Yes, and look! She's alive.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d it ever get complicated,

working with her while maintaining

a sexual relationship?

</line>


<line>
Well, she's always been good

at keeping her personal

and professional lives separate.

</line>


<line>
-Quite an accomplished woman.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said it.

</line>


<line>
She was an agent's assistant

when I met her

and now she's r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning her own company.

Plus, she's a great mom.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Oh, fish! <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>m!

</line>


<line>
-I forgot about <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd's date!

-I can watch <name type="PERSON">Ruthie</name> for a few <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[whispers]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
What can you tell me

about <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy Jerominek?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>?

-In the '90s, you had a fan club--

</line>


<line>
-How do you know all this?

-Do you know where I'm going here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy. Yes.

She was the president of my fan club.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u slept with her.

</line>


<line>
We had a lovely evening together.

We both got something out of it, and--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you take a high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol girl

to her prom?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was a family friend.

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you help a teen mom

sneak out of rehab

and take her to a high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol party?

</line>


<line>
I didn't <ital>take</ital> her. We went together.

</line>


<line>
Is it true you once dated a woman

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'d just woken up

from a 30-year coma?

</line>


<line>
-Were you attracted to her naiveté, too?

-What does all this have to with--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with the president

of your fan club.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with your agent's assistant.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u party with <name type="ORG">un</name>derage girls.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't see a pattern here?

-It's not a pattern.

</line>


<line>
-Do you enjoy having power over women?

-I don't even know what that means.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't know what it means

to have power over women?

</line>


<line>
I don't have power over anyone.

I barely have power over myself.

</line>


<line>
But you do have power over people.

And a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in and a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, you abuse that power.

</line>


<line>
All these women that you mentioned,

I never forced myself--

</line>


<line>
Not through force,

but you <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand the power differential.

</line>


<line>
So, I can't be with any woman

I might have power over?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name> does that leave me with?

-I'm just pointing out a series of--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think everything

is this nefarious scheme.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>st of the bad shit

that happens in this world

isn't because of wicked plots

and machinations.

</line>


<line>
It's just because we're all

a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of stupid, h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rny little goons just grabbing at shit,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping it'll press that little button

in our brain that says,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">"Okay</name>, you're happy now."

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not an "abuse of power."

</line>


<line>
Do you really believe you didn't have

the power in all of t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se relationships?

</line>


<line>
I... I am an addict.

</line>


<line>
One of the first things that I had

to accept was my own powerlessness.

</line>


<line>
-But that's--

-I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand what I did was wrong.

</line>


<line>
I'm not denying that.

But you're trying to paint this picture.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're making it out like I'm a bad guy,

and I'm not.

</line>


<line>
I'm not that guy you're saying I am.

</line>


<line>
-So, back to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>...

-No. Why?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve her the heroin...

</line>


<line>
I already told you, yes.

How many times can I say it?

</line>


<line>
Breaking news! <name type="PERSON">T</name>he thing I told you

yesterday is still true.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you ever give <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l?

-What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he first time <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> ever got dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k,

she was a child, and it was vodka, right?

</line>


<line>
How... <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you know about that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were bringing vodka

to the set of "<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d."

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> told you all this stuff?

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name> tell you that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor Champ,

thank you for returning my call.

</line>


<line>
I didn't wanna say anything,

but just watching <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>

in that interview,

talking like he's a victim in all this.

</line>


<line>
If the world only knew the things

I know...

</line>


<line>
I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand as a therapist,

you're not at li<name type="PERSON">bert</name>y to divulge

what your client told you in confidence.

</line>


<line>
But I'm not a therapist.

I'm a therapy <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse.

</line>


<line>
And I can tell you everything.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Because <name type="PERSON">Sharona</name> was a dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k, too,

so you can't trust a thing she says.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, she has a vendetta a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst me.

Besides, I already apologized to her.

</line>


<line>
Apologized for what?

</line>


<line>
Okay, when you put it all together,

it looks bad.

</line>


<line>
Do you see any connection between

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se other women and <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's no connection between anyone,

that's what I keep saying!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> wasn't like t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se other girls.

</line>


<line>
I loved <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

She was like a daughter to me.

</line>


<line>
I just keep seeing this story of you

taking yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g women...

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Grooming them...

</line>


<line>
I didn't <ital>groom</ital> anyone, okay?

</line>


<line>
It's not like I got <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

for the purpose

of taking advantage of her.

</line>


<line>
She was ten! I didn't even have sex

with her <name type="ORG">un</name>til she was 30!

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, what?

-No. I just mean that--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you say you had sex with her?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was later. She was an adult.

</line>


<line>
And we were both so dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k and high,

I didn't--

</line>


<line>
We didn't know what we were doing.

</line>


<line>
We were addicts,

and the thing about addicts--

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his was during your bender?

-Yeah. No! A different bender.

</line>


<line>
I took her to rehab, by the way!

I tried to get her help.

</line>


<line>
I just keep thinking

about t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se 17 minutes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u waiting in the parking lot

after she died.

</line>


<line>
But she wasn't actually dead yet.

She died in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital.

</line>


<line>
-Right, but at the time, I didn't...

-Ever wonder what would've happened

if you didn't take t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se 17 minutes?

Do you think she might still--

</line>


<line>
No! I... <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, obviously

when I did all that stuff, I wasn't--

</line>


<line>
So to recap, you <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name> alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>l

when she was a child.

</line>


<line>
She then became an addict.

</line>


<line>
Come on, there was a lot of stuff

in between--

</line>


<line>
I'm talking now. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not talking.

</line>


<line>
When she was intoxicated,

you had sex with her,

and when she was sober,

you <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve her the heroin that killed her.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen in an effort to cover for yourself,

you waited to call the paramedics

that might have saved her life.

</line>


<line>
And you don't think

you have any power over women.

</line>


<line>
So, it didn't go great.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he gross part is she doesn't even care.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is just a ratings win she can use

as leverage for her next big paycheck.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe.

-She was all over the place.

</line>


<line>
I think people are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see

that she was just out to get me.

</line>


<line>
-People are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> see that, right?

-I guess we'll find out tonight.

</line>


<line>
Okay, maybe she had some good points,

but she completely

<name type="ORG">un</name>dermined herself with, like...

</line>


<line>
I mean, we dated for like seven years.

</line>


<line>
Do you think that I took advantage of you?

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] I'm here, aren't I?

-And she kept bringing it back to women--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese "women I hurt"

because that's what's hip now, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>rting women?

But I have also hurt a lot of men!

</line>


<line>
I told you to do just the one interview

and go back to <name type="GPE">Connecticut</name>.

</line>


<line>
-But it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be okay, right?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna grab some tacos?

What do you think?

</line>


<line>
-I think you have three <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs...

-[car alarm chirps]

</line>


<line>
...before this interview airs

and your world changes completely.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld think about

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you wanna spend that time.

</line>


<line>
I'm going <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me to my daughter.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[engine starts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Son</name>ny! It's great to finally meet you.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Son</name>ny! Come on!

-<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d evening, ma'am.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
What's this? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u made varsity?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Coach moved me up

for the rest of the season.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>! Congratulations!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to wait for the <name type="PERSON">jack</name>et.

</line>


<line>
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

</line>


<line>
We s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld get <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>-style cheese fries

to celebrate.

</line>


<line>
-Oh! I'll get--

-I'm getting cheese fries.

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles] So... lacrosse.

-What's your deal?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-My dad has a thing for broken women.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen he nurses them back to health,

and when they're better they leave.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> leave him?

</line>


<line>
-Does your dad think I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> leave him?

-It doesn't matter, because eventually

my mom and dad

are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get back together.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're still in love.

</line>


<line>
-What? No, they hate each other.

-No, they don't.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey fight all the time.

-Wha-- Really?

</line>


<line>
-[cries]

-Oh! W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a!

</line>


<line>
-My dad hates my mom?

-Uh... No! Of course not!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen why would you say that?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're so mean!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sobs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I was gone for two minutes!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
Ah.

</line>


<line>
Is this anything?

</line>


<line>
"My girlfriend was upset

I <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve her a CD for Christmas.

</line>


<line>
But she <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve me <name type="PERSON">VD</name> for Hanukkah!"

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's nothing.

And possibly <name type="NORP">anti-Semitic</name>. Hold still.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! I am so ready

to never do stand-up a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
Are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> put me

on your <name type="PERSON">T</name>V s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w or what?

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, the network loves you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey just need you to do a screen test.

It's basically a formality.

</line>


<line>
-Screen test?

-What, you're too good for it?

</line>


<line>
No, it's cool! A screen test! Ha!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna hit <name type="PERSON">Alma</name>'s after the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

Best tacos in <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

-Ugh!

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>libu is for pretentious

</line>


<line>
-Hold still so I can finish.

-Finish what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, you might never get a star

on <name type="ORG">the Walk of Fame</name> or a wax statue.

</line>


<line>
But this way you'll always be i<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ortalized

and <name type="ORG">un</name>disturbed in <name type="PERSON">Holly</name>wood forever.

</line>


<line>
Unless they repaint.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[Coltrane]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Anybody from out of town?

It's a trick question, it's <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Everybody's from out of town.

-[audience laughing]

<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, man. I hated your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-"<name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d." Hated it.

-Yeah, that's a hell of an opener.

</line>


<line>
But my baby brother loved it.

</line>


<line>
I'd be in my bedroom, sulking

and I'd hear him laughing his ass off

in the living room.

</line>


<line>
He had this great laugh.

</line>


<line>
Drugs took a lot from him,

but he still had that laugh.

</line>


<line>
Right up to the end.

</line>


<line>
Now anytime I hear anything about

that s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w, I hear my brother's laugh.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for that.

-Well, shit. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're welcome.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you wanna go up?

</line>


<line>
Oh, man. I...

I haven't done stand-up in years.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're famous. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey'll get

a kick out of it even if you suck.

when you order a meal

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u expect me to order

the bucatini carbonara at <name type="PERSON">Gusto</name>
