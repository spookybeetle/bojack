<ital>It's a dream come true.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You've been trying to get</ital>

<ital>this movie made for 20 years.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,</ital>

<ital>talking about</ital> Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
Sitting here? In this hotel room?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
It's a dream come true.

</line>


<line>
What's it like to play Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
Dream come true.

</line>


<line>
Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

</line>


<line>
Dream come true.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>How long you in <name type="GPE">New York</name> for?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Just a couple days of fun interviews,

then it's off to <name type="GPE">Chicago</name>

for more fun interviews,

and then, if I don't blow my brains out,

I get to go back to L.A.

</line>


<line>
Darling, you're doing marvelously,

I am so proud of you.

</line>


<line>
If I could make one slight adjustment?

</line>


<line>
Maybe fewer jokes

about how these interviews

</line>


<line>
- make you want to blow your brains out?

- Right. Sorry.

</line>


<line>
I am so thrilled to be here,

talking with, uh...

</line>


<line>
-<name type="ORG">Yahoo</name> <name type="GPE">Finland</name>.

-<name type="ORG">Yahoo</name> <name type="GPE">Finland</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Are you <name type="NORP">Finnish</name>?

- No, we are just getting started.

</line>


<line>
Walked right into that one.

</line>


<line>
What would an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> nomination

mean for Mr. <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>?

</line>


<line>
Any award recognition is just gravy.

</line>


<line>
The real joy is to sit

in this hotel room all day,

answering the same questions

over and over again.

</line>


<line>
Great answers, you're divine.

I'm in love with you.

</line>


<line>
One small adjustment.

I don't think sarcasm is going to read.

</line>


<line>
Just write a script for me,

so I don't have to think for myself.

</line>


<line>
Honey, I would shove my hand

up your ass

and control your mouth like a <name type="NORP">Muppet</name>

if it would win you an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
What do I know?

</line>


<line>
I'm just the publicist you hired

to help win you an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>What's it like to play Seabiscuit?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

You'd have to ask <name type="PERSON">Tobey Maguire</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Your last attempt at a comeback

was <ital>The <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name> Show.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Pass.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 2]</nonVerbComm> People still see you as the guy

from that sucky show from the '90s.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Horsin' Around </ital>was not a sucky show.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, but it was.

- It lasted nine seasons.

</line>


<line>
Its whole purpose

was for people to watch it

so the network could sell ad time,

so the show could make more money

than it cost to produce.

</line>


<line>
It did that well. It was a good show.

</line>


<line>
- Yes, but it sucked.

- It didn't suck!

</line>


<line>
Great job today.

It could not have gone better.

</line>


<line>
My only note would be

stop defending <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Why? Millions of people loved it!

</line>


<line>
We need to use these next few months

to define your story.

</line>


<line>
When people see you

they need to think <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> winner,

not dumb asshole from an old TV show

that nobody cares about.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I hear what you're saying,

but we can both agree <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

was a good show, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you know

I think the world of you.

</line>


<line>
I think you are so smart and attractive,

so I'm not going to mince words.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Horsin' Around </ital>was a piece of shit.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[funky electronic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ ♪</music> </ital>

</line>


<line>
Looking good. Fantastic.

You need a coaster.

</line>


<line>
I told you to wear lipstick

and underpants, <name type="PERSON">Teresa</name>.

</line>


<line>
I put everything bill-related

in one folder.

</line>


<line>
Gas bill, cable bill,

and the new headshots for Billy Zane.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

- You also wanted me to remind you

</line>


<line>
- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ping</name> me again in two minutes?

No, five minutes.

</line>


<line>
Uh, when's our call

with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and Spanakopita?

</line>


<line>
The one that started seven minutes ago?

It started seven minutes ago.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>'s in your office right now,

stalling... poorly.

</line>


<line>
And that is my opinion on the <name type="ORG">Octomom</name>.

</line>


<line>
Remember <name type="ORG">Octomom</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital><name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, are you stalling</ital>

<ital>for Princess Carolyn?</ital>

</line>


<line>
What? You know who was good at stallin'

was Joseph Stalin. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>If anything,</ital>

<ital>Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Get your head out of your ass.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He also had a city named after him.

Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,

</line>


<line>
- who's been here the whole time?

- Hey, buddy.

</line>


<line>
How was your first big day

at the press junket?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Endless. It was like

the second act of a <name type="PERSON">Judd Apatow</name> movie.

</line>


<line>
He was exquisite.

</line>


<line>
The movie's tracking really well

on social.

</line>


<line>
New media impressions are up

23 percent across platforms.

</line>


<line>
What does that mean?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I have no idea.

I assumed you would know.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
But I keep tweeting things

and they keep getting retweeted,

</line>


<line>
so we're doing something right.

</line>


<line>
Yesterday I dropped my phone

in the bathroom

which made <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s <name type="ORG">Instagram</name>

post a picture of the floor,

with the caption "<ital>spujb."</ital>

That got 4000 likes.

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>] <ital>Great.</ital>

- I am exhausted.

</line>


<line>
Being a movie star is the hardest job.

</line>


<line>
And we get no recognition.

[grunts]

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're gonna love this.

</line>


<line>
I pulled some strings at <ital>Manatee Fair</ital>

and set up an interview tomorrow night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is not ready

for a magazine feature.

</line>


<line>
Relax. It's not that big a deal.

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize

you were an authority on deal size.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Listen, Moussaka...</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ladies, please.

There's plenty of <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> to go around.

</line>


<line>
I can do all the bullshit things

<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>'s scheduled for me in the morning

and still have time for Princess Carolyn's

bullshit thing tomorrow night.

</line>


<line>
Now, pajamas.

</line>


<line>
- Whaa!

- [gasping]

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?!

- <ital>What is going on over there?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> smuggled</ital>

<ital>a young boy into his room.</ital>

</line>


<line>
No big deal.

Movie stars do it all the time.

</line>


<line>
Where am I? [sniffs]

</line>


<line>
Bagels? Pizza?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffing]</nonVerbComm> Hipsters? Urine?

</line>


<line>
- Am I in <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>?

- What? No, you're in <name type="GPE">New York</name>.

</line>


<line>
Follow-up: why are you in <name type="GPE">New York</name>?

</line>


<line>
Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moaning]</nonVerbComm>

I can't get to sleep. Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that'll do it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Is my name <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> Koenig?

Because I'm about to get cereal.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I am the queen.

</line>


<line>
Follow me, citizens.

</line>


<line>
There are no sad times

in our cave of possibilities.

<nonVerbComm>[monitor beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- [beeping]

- Huh.

</line>


<line>
Small bottle of shampoo?!

Not on my watch!

</line>


<line>
- [alarm ringing]

- [screaming]

</line>


<line>
You better not have gotten

your failure stink

all over my important movie star clothes.

</line>


<line>
- Ohh...

- I didn't mean that.

</line>


<line>
You're my friend

and you don't stink of failure.

</line>


<line>
Your stink is one of good intentions

and youthful exuberance.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm>

<ital><name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>, compliment!</ital>

</line>


<line>
You wanted me to ping you

regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,

I have to make a quick call.

</line>


<line>
- What? You're already on a call.

- <ital>Sorry.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Please hold.

- [<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>] <ital>This is ridiculous.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- [Princess Carolyn] <ital>It's your agent!</ital>

</line>


<line>
I wanted to remind you

of your meeting with <name type="PERSON">Pinky</name> today.

</line>


<line>
I think I'm already in it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[annoyed throat clearing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Do I need to be on this call still?

- I put you on conference. How do I...?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>, is that you?!

- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic

you posted yesterday.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Spujb! </ital>Classic <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>We should get together sometime</ital>

<ital>and take a selfie.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'd love to, buddy,

but I'm kinda in <name type="GPE">New York</name> right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> <ital><name type="GPE">New York</name> City?!</ital>

<ital>They make such great salsa.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm here too, honey.

Have a great meeting!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?! Wait, you went to <name type="GPE">New York</name>?

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] <ital>No. I'm just on--</ital>

- Why wouldn't you tell me?

</line>


<line>
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I just... I feel safer when I know</ital>

<ital>that I know where you are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- I affirm your feelings...

- [<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] <ital>I don't want to--</ital>

</line>


<line>
...your feelings have value,

but I'm not in <name type="GPE">New York</name>,

I'm just on the conference call.

</line>


<line>
- Guys, can we...

- [Peanutbutter]<ital> I feel heard.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] <ital>I hear that you feel heard.</ital>

- What the hell is happening?

</line>


<line>
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in <name type="GPE">New York</name>!

- <ital>What?!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>As <name type="PERSON">Carrie</name> from</ital>

Sex and the City <ital>might say...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>- I'm <name type="PERSON">Carrie</name>.</ital>

- [Peanutbutter] <ital><name type="PERSON">Todd</name>? In the naked city?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm> <ital>That is going to lead</ital>

<ital>to some wackiness. You mark my words.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Would you guys literally mark my words?

I do want to refer back to this later on.

</line>


<line>
We're in the middle of a meeting!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm> G<ital>ot to go.</ital>

<ital>It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Right?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research

on J.D. <name type="PERSON">Salinger</name>.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Rabbit, Run?</ital>

</line>


<line>
- <ital>That's Updike, you illiterate.</ital>

- What's Updike?

</line>


<line>
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

</line>


<line>
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Has it been reclaimed?</ital>

<ital>I honestly can't keep track.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Who are you asking?

- [<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>] <ital>We're hanging up now, goodbye.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wow! <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> in the Big Apple.

</line>


<line>
I want to find one of those fortune

telling robots that can make me big!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, champ,

I have a very important job for you.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you go get us some ice?

</line>


<line>
You don't need to patronize me.

</line>


<line>
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.

- [<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] Don't get lost, buddy!

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna get lost.

</line>


<line>
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
Hello? Are you still there?

</line>


<line>
- They may have hung up.

- I have some good news for once.

</line>


<line>
I just got promoted

to head of programming.

</line>


<line>
I'm no longer a passenger

on the burning wreckage of an industry

that is broadcast television.

</line>


<line>
- I'm a captain!

- What happened to <name type="PERSON">Wanda</name>?

</line>


<line>
You didn't hear? She got poached.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

- By another company.

</line>


<line>
Oh, good.

</line>


<line>
- They shot her.

- Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

</line>


<line>
Straight to the top

of the corporate ladder!

</line>


<line>
- Oh, good.

- She had to move to Detroit.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

</line>


<line>
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, the network

is finally breaking even,

thanks to the runaway success

of <ital>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What Do They Know?</ital>

<ital>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Not to mention its companion show

<ital>Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What Do They Know?</ital>

<ital>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>With <name type="PERSON">Chris</name> Hardwick.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- So as long as you two stick around...

- I'm taking the show off the air.

</line>


<line>
Wait, what? Why?!

</line>


<line>
I told the story I wanted to tell.

</line>


<line>
To prolong it for commercial reasons

would be crass and inorganic.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
At long last the public knows

what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

</line>


<line>
- and what they don't know.

- [moaning]

</line>


<line>
- Did they know things?

- [whimpers]

</line>


<line>
- Well, we found out.

- This is a nightmare.

</line>


<line>
Why does everything I love fall apart

as soon as I touch it?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

</line>


<line>
I <ital>am </ital>no Christopher

from the <name type="ORG">Tesla</name> dealership.

</line>


<line>
Is this as good as it gets?

</line>


<line>
Or are we living in the ghost town

where once my career did blossom?

</line>


<line>
Who will speak my name

when I am gone?

</line>


<line>
Who will sing lamentations

for he who once talked soup?

</line>


<line>
- [groans]

- What legacy of ruin am I left with?

</line>


<line>
What rewards have I reaped

for the damage done?

</line>


<line>
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobbing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps and growls]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
But before you fold the omelette,

</line>


<line>
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up

and whisper his or her dreams into it.

</line>


<line>
Whisper dreams into omelette.

</line>


<line>
Just coffee.

Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

</line>


<line>
You look different. Older. A lot older.

</line>


<line>
I'm not saying you look bad,

just much, much, much older.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>.

</line>


<line>
You haven't heard from <name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>

recently, have you?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>? I haven't talked

to him since the show was canceled.

</line>


<line>
I worry about him.

</line>


<line>
About six months back, he disappeared,

stopped returning my calls.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure he's fine.

I mean, who returns calls?

</line>


<line>
Promise me you'll check on him

when you get back to L.A.

</line>


<line>
Maybe swing by his house?

I think you owe him that much.

</line>


<line>
Fine. Listen, about the play...

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Tragedy of <name type="PERSON">Greg</name> KingLear,</ital>

a theatrical immersion by <name type="PERSON">Jill</name> Pill?

</line>


<line>
- Right.

- That's dead. Over.

</line>


<line>
A thing that happened

that happens no longer,

</line>


<line>
- like a whimper in the wind.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.

We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

</line>


<line>
And the void says,

"Stop shouting at me, please!"

</line>


<line>
And we grab the void and we spit

in its face, "Sir, I will not."

</line>


<line>
Boy, did <name type="GPE">New York</name> do a number on you.

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you about my next piece.

It starts with you,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>,

completely naked and covered in milk.

</line>


<line>
- I'll stop you there.

- It's a symbol for rebirth.

</line>


<line>
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

</line>


<line>
I'm still recovering

from being birthed the first time.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jill</name>, I'm not the guy who does things

that are challenging,

or edgy, or covered in milk.

</line>


<line>
I'm about to be nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

I'm thinking about my legacy now.

</line>


<line>
I want to do things that connect

with people, things that last.

</line>


<line>
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

</line>


<line>
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

people will still be able

to see me in <ital>Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- And then what?

- And then...

</line>


<line>
I'll be remembered.

If I win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>, I'll be remembered.

</line>


<line>
- And then what?

- Then my life will have meaning.

</line>


<line>
- I don't know!

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
You know what the real tragedy

of <ital><name type="PERSON">Greg</name> KingLear </ital>is?

</line>


<line>
Two hours long without an intermission?

</line>


<line>
It's that he's a marionette.

</line>


<line>
And he doesn't even know someone else

is pulling his strings.

</line>


<line>
Mmm, I don't think the chef

whispered his dreams into this.

</line>


<line>
This does not taste like dreams.

</line>


<line>
You told me I would be getting

more attention at a smaller agency,

but if anything, I'm getting less.

</line>


<line>
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

Let me just send this one email...

</line>


<line>
What? Why isn't it sending? <name type="GPE">Judah</name>!

</line>


<line>
I'm taking my business

to <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name> <name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name>.

</line>


<line>
What? No!

</line>


<line>
J.D. <name type="PERSON">Salinger</name> is too big a star to be

<line>
I need an agency

with at least nine stories.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
That was a reference to my work,

with which you are clearly not familiar.

</line>


<line>
- Oh...

- Goodbye.

</line>


<line>
Hello to you, Rasputin.

</line>


<line>
- Give my regards to the czar.

- I will relay the message.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't know why

I thought I could do this.

</line>


<line>
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

</line>


<line>
I believe I can take on

more responsibility around here.

</line>


<line>
- On a provisional basis, of course.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
But we're a small agency

and we need to think like one.

</line>


<line>
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

we should focus on better gigs

for the clients we already have.

</line>


<line>
- Oh. Like <ital>Jerry Maguire.</ital>

<ital>- </ital>Yes.

</line>


<line>
- What part of <ital>Jerry Maguire</ital>?

- The part where <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> Cruise's agent

got him a massive payday

for being in <ital>Jerry Maguire.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I was looking forward

to taking some time off.

</line>


<line>
What?

That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

</line>


<line>
You're the biggest name in TV right now.

</line>


<line>
<ital>and every network would love to air</ital>

<ital>your next project.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Why don't you get off your lazy keister

and make us all billionaires?

Go get us some money.

<ital>Go get it, boy. You can do it!</ital>

There's my favorite accountant!

</line>


<line>
It's gonna be great, as it always is,

from my perspective.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Dad</name>, you promised

we were gonna play catch,

and then we'd listen to your favorite

<line>
You never told me what it was!

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's <ital>Cat's in the Cradle</ital>,

but don't listen to it now!

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go listen to it.

</line>


<line>
No! The lyrics are too relevant.

Don't do it.

</line>


<line>
- No!

<nonVerbComm>[both laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So, what's next for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
What do you mean, "What's next?"

Why does everything have to have a next?

</line>


<line>
I just mean, after <ital>Secretariat's</ital> all over,

what are you going to do next?

</line>


<line>
We were told this feature would be

pegged to the release of <ital>Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It is, but we also want to get to know

the real <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Do we?

- If you want the real <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

there's a book written about that.

</line>


<line>
But that was <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

before the book came out.

</line>


<line>
Who's <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> now?

</line>


<line>
Who's <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> now? <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is just...

</line>


<line>
He's a guy who could use a drink,

that's who!

</line>


<line>
Should we order alcohol?

</line>


<line>
Heather, could we have

a moment of privacy, please?

</line>


<line>
Sure. I'll just plug my ears

and sing an old sea shanty.

</line>

Sweetheart, I don't think

we need to be drinking tonight.

Trust me, you do not want me

to do this sober.

<line>
You don't need to micromanage

everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.

All right.

You clearly have everything under control.

- She's a human, but yes.

</line>


<line>
Well, when the cat's away...

</line>


<line>
Again, a human.

I like where you're going with this.

</line>


<line>
I gotta tell you,

I really loved the movie.

</line>


<line>
You're definitely going to win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
That "You Are Secretariat" scene?

Oh, it made me wet.

</line>


<line>
It made you wet?!

</line>


<line>
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.

</line>


<line>
It refers to a feeling

of comfort and warmth,

because a manatee's

natural habitat is water.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
- It also made me really horny.

- Uh...

</line>


<line>
That's narwhal slang.

</line>


<line>
You know, because they have horns.

<ital>One day you look in the mirror</ital>

"Who is this sad, broken man?"

Listen, kid, I don't need your life story.

I just came out here to commit suicide.

<nonVerbComm>[chuckling and kissing]</nonVerbComm>

The first thing you notice about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

is he's got a nice buzz going.

</line>


<line>
Oh, one final question.

Are you more man than horse?

</line>


<line>
Or are you more horse than man?

</line>


<line>
What the hell does that mean?

Take off your city clothes

Okay! A manatee and a horse

making out with each other.

</line>


<line>
Just like in nature.

</line>


<line>
In the old days sailors thought

manatees were mermaids.

</line>


<line>
Remember that episode of <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

where <name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> wanted to be a mermaid?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to think about that show.

</line>


<line>
I didn't come back to your hotel room

because you're a goofy dad who once got

his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

</line>


<line>
I'm pretty sure

that never happened on the show.

</line>


<line>
If I'm going to sacrifice

my journalistic integrity,

it's because I'm having sex

with a movie star.

</line>


<line>
And they're off!

<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Heather]</nonVerbComm> You like that, little horsie?

[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Gonna</name> climb up onto your boat.

</line>


<line>
- [Heather] What happened?

- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Heather]</nonVerbComm> You want me to touch it,

<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm>

No, no, just...

</line>


<line>
Why did you say

that thing about the boat?

I don't know, I was being sexy.

You okay?

</line>


<line>
Just forget it. You ruined it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You want to talk about it?

</line>


<line>
There's nothing to talk about.

It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

</line>


<line>
She just walked in

at the worst possible...

</line>


<line>
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
On the boat, there was a girl.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- In <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
And she trusted me.

</line>


<line>
I keep asking myself

if her mother didn't walk in,

would I have done it?

</line>


<line>
And part of me is sure

that I-- I couldn't.

</line>


<line>
But another part knows that's a lie.

</line>


<line>
How do you make something right

when you've made it so wrong

you can never go back?

</line>

I just think

you have to keep moving forward?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Yeah.

</line>

All my life that's all I've ever done.

What's it gotten me?

Well, hey, look,

you're the star of a movie now.

</line>


<line>
You're probably gonna win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm not even in it. That's not me.

</line>


<line>
- What do you mean, that's not you?

- I was digitally replaced.

</line>


<line>
Special effects. None of it's me.

</line>


<line>
Wow, that's... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
That's quite a story.

<line>
I shouldn't even be here.

Too bad <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>'s not here.

</line>


<line>
He's always the best

at coming up with ideas

that at first might seem terrible...

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
If he was here,

he'd probably say something like,

</line>


<line>
"Hey, you know what's cool?

Spaghetti strainers!"

</line>


<line>
Go on.

</line>


<line>
And you'd say, "I feel like

I've seen that somewhere before."

</line>


<line>
Hah! That is so me!

</line>


<line>
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

that this spaghetti strainer

is also a hat?"

</line>


<line>
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

</line>


<line>
That is a brilliant idea!

</line>


<line>
That's a terrible idea.

That's my point!

</line>


<line>
Put that in the maybe pile.

</line>


<line>
Right now, we need to focus

on TV shows.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> would suggest,

</line>


<line>
<ital>A Spaghetti Strainer</ital>

<ital>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That's it! <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, you've done it again.

</line>


<line>
No! Nobody's done anything.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oxnard</name>, I want you to buy out

the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

</line>


<line>
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

</line>


<line>
I'm putting all my money

in spaghetti strainers for this show.

</line>


<line>
- How is this a show?

- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

</line>


<line>

- [vehicle stopping]

- [door opens, closes]

</line>


<line>
I took care of our problem.

</line>


<line>
What did you do?

</line>


<line>
You don't need to know anything else.

It's been taken care of.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ana</name>...

</line>


<line>
There-- There was a moment

back at the hotel where...

</line>


<line>
I really thought I blew it,

I was scared it was all over, and--

</line>


<line>
And then after, I was relieved.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I should win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
- I don't know if I want to.

- Stop punishing yourself.

</line>


<line>
I was in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>.

</line>


<line>
None of that matters.

All that matters now is the story.

</line>


<line>
We get to decide what our story is.

</line>


<line>
Nobody else gets to tell you

what your story is.

</line>


<line>
- What is my story?

- I'll tell you.

</line>


<line>
This has been your dream for the last

30 years. You made it happen.

</line>


<line>
An <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> won't make you happy forever,

it won't solve all your problems.

</line>


<line>
You win that <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>,

the next day you go back to being you.

</line>


<line>
But that night is a really good night.

</line>


<line>
I think you deserve a really good night,

and I know how to get you there.

</line>


<line>
Do you want that?

</line>


<line>
Yes, I do.

</line>


<line>
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

</line>


<line>

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, it's such a beautiful movie

and I think such a textured performance.

</line>


<line>
When you were on <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>,

could you ever have imagined

that you'd give a performance like this?

</line>


<line>
- Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.

- [laughter]

</line>


<line>
I always knew I was more

than just a dumb TV actor.

</line>


<line>
Even if other people

didn't always know that.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- Seriously, though...

that TV show...

it wasn't me.

</line>


<line>
This movie is me.

to finally be doing

the kind of work that I can be proud of.
