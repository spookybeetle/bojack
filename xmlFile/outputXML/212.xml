<ital><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok alive, bright eyes.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's the morning and somebody loves you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Right back at you, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>. He's here.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>here he is.

</line>


<line>
-I love you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

-I love you, too.

</line>


<line>
Idea for a new <name type="ORG">Pixar</name> movie:

what are pizza boxes thinking about?

</line>


<line>
-And <name type="PERSON">Leland <name type="PERSON">Stan</name>ford</name>?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ranscontinental Railroad.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ranscontinental Railroad?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is correct.

</line>


<line>
Next question,

what is my favorite kind of berry?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Barry</name> <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>stwick.

-Raspberry?

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,

of course, was <name type="PERSON">Barry</name> <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>stwick.

</line>


<line>
-How was I supposed to know?

-He also likes <name type="PERSON">Franken Berry</name>.

</line>


<line>
-We would have accepted <name type="PERSON">Franken Berry</name>.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, you lose.

-What the...?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's our s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w, but before we go

I wanna send out a quick message.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, if you're watching this, I love you

and I know you're doing great things.

</line>


<line>
Idea for a new app: an <name type="ORG">un</name>do button

that could <name type="ORG">un</name>do long amo<name type="ORG">un</name>ts of time.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hree months. A year. A life.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Eric</name>a, where did that tooth come from?

All right, let's keep this party going.

</line>


<line>
One click and everything could

just go back to the way it was.

<line>
I've been trying to get in touch

with you for two months.

</line>


<line>
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

</line>


<line>
Aah! What is it?

</line>


<line>
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them

to take my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use. I belong to the sea now.

</line>


<line>
-Are you dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k?

-Only on adventure. And gin.

</line>


<line>
And vodka. And gin.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> sue you.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey finished the movie.

</line>


<line>
-What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.

-I don't know, ask <name type="PERSON">T</name>urteltaub.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not why I'm here.

I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you were in <name type="PERSON">Cordovia</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been here this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le time?

<line>
Idea for a thing Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld do... Shut up.

</line>


<line>
Get dressed.

We're going to the orphanage.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> What orphanage?

</line>


<line>
Remember at <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral,

I asked you what you wanted me to do

</line>


<line>
-with your <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d </ital>residuals?

-I do... not remember that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said, "Give it to an orphanage

or something."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It turns out you made enough money

</line>


<line>
to build a brand new one.

So congratulations. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a hero.

</line>


<line>
A hero?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's right, a hero.

</line>


<line>
Or is it prono<name type="ORG">un</name>ced "gyro?"

I just call them subs.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,

you're a great man.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man Orphanage.

</line>


<line>
Or, as we call it,

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>phanage.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u cannot call it that.

</line>


<line>
A, because I am not a great man and B,

because that is a really stupid name.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he name was <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lly's idea.

-Stop pissing off the orphans.

</line>


<line>
A lot of them grow up

to be serial killers.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for that lovely song.

But I'm not a good person.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is the only good thing I've ever done

and I did it by accident.

</line>


<line>
And it just goes to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you

life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

</line>


<line>
I don't have to tell you <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard life is.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the ones with the dead parents.

</line>


<line>
-My parents are dead?

-No. No. Not necessarily.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe they just didn't want you.

</line>


<line>
My point is,

I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w people live.

</line>


<line>
It's amazing to me that people

wake up every morning

</line>


<line>
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."

How do people do it?

</line>


<line>
I don't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Yay.

</line>


<line>
So you see, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, the nimble improviser

must navi<name type="PERSON">ga</name>te the most sensitive of areas.

</line>


<line>
-And I'm not just talking about the butt.

-Ha.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you always come

up with these amazing butt jokes?

</line>


<line>
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,

you don't come up with butt jokes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u live truthfully in the moment

and the butt joke comes to you.

</line>


<line>
So true. So wise.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I need to "s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ve off,"

as we sailors say,

on my comedy cruise line, the <ital><name type="PERSON">Giggleship</name>.</ital>

I shan't be returning.

</line>


<line>
-Shan't you?

-I shannot.

</line>


<line>
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,

as my <name type="ORG">Nu</name>mber <name type="PERSON">T</name>wo

and I don't mean<ital> that</ital> kind of number two.

</line>


<line>
What, number two, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w do you do that?

</line>


<line>
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cost me 50 grand.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of

production. If there's anything I can do.

</line>


<line>
Do? What do? <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>vie's finished.

</line>


<line>
-We fixed the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing in post.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Remember your first week, these nerds

made a computer scan of your head

so we could finish

if something happened?

</line>


<line>
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

</line>


<line>
Something happened to you,

so these nerds finished the movie.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok what Computer <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> can do.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Help you out of that tree, ma'am?</ital>

-<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at him save that cat.

</line>


<line>
Now there's a protagonist

we can root for.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u did all that in the computer?

-Not just that.

</line>


<line>
Computer <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> had so much charisma

and screen presence we ended up going back

</line>


<line>
-and replacing you in every scene.

-I'm not in the movie at all?

</line>


<line>
Not technically, but computer you

is giving the performance of your career.

</line>


<line>
When people see what you do in this movie,

they are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> storm

<name type="PERSON">Daniel</name> <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>'s <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use,

schlep him out into the street,

s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot him in the head.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w good your performance is.

</line>


<line>
It's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> make <name type="PERSON">Daniel</name> <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>

look like shit.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> hate <name type="PERSON">Daniel</name> <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>.

-But it's not my performance.

</line>


<line>
Explain that the widow <name type="PERSON">Day-Lewis</name>.

She'll be devastated. <name type="PERSON">Kaput</name>. <name type="PERSON">Kapleshky</name>.

</line>


<line>
Are you <name type="NORP">Jew</name>ish? Because I feel

some of these you're just making up.

</line>


<line>
We got a screening this weekend.

</line>


<line>
Come see the movie,

we'll <name type="PERSON">schmooze</name>, we'll kibitz,

schlemiel, sch<name type="PERSON">lima</name>zel,

<name type="PERSON">Hasenpfeffer Incorporated</name>.

</line>


<line>
Just think, <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn,

in one week, all of this will be ours.

</line>


<line>
We s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld a put a social-media desk there.

</line>


<line>
If we hire someone to micromanage

our clients' online personas

and new media outreach, they'll seem

more gro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded down to earth.

</line>


<line>
Smiling poop emoji,

I love everything about that.

</line>


<line>
I wanna make sure the couches

we get are really comfortable.

</line>


<line>
-Just in case we have some late nights.

-[laughs] Mr. <name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a place of business.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment

for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond?

</line>


<line>
I just wanna remember this instant

where for once in my life,

</line>


<line>
-everything was going--

-Hold that t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught.

</line>


<line>
What is it?

</line>


<line>
Ugh. My wife and I are going

to the ballet tonight,

there's a real ish

with the restaurant.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is the wife you're divorcing, right?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w it is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u say you want a divorce

and she says, "No, we can make this work."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u go to co<name type="ORG">un</name>seling and

remember why you fell in love with her

in the first place

and then, blah, blah, it's a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing.

</line>


<line>
We've been sleeping together

for three months.

</line>


<line>
-We're about to start a company together.

-None of that has to change.

</line>


<line>
I am definitely going to divorce

her probably, it's just...

</line>


<line>
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s never been married.

</line>


<line>
-Listen, this is--

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
Sorry, <name type="PERSON">Katie</name> just said something f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I gotta <name type="PERSON">ho</name>p. I love you, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh.

</line>


<line>
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning,

I'll be back in a-- Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.

I'm going away for a while.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, where?

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <ital><name type="PERSON">Giggleship</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's the comedy cruise line

<ital>People </ital>ma<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zine

</line>


<line>
-once called "a comedy cruise line."

-Comedy cruise line?

</line>


<line>
Oh right, your improv thing.

How was your, uh, graduation s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w?

</line>


<line>
-It was two months ago. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u missed it.

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
-No, you're not.

-Well...

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you remember the morning

after my first night here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know why everyone keeps asking

if I remember things. I don't.

</line>


<line>
Just as a general rule,

if your question begins, "Do you remember"

and doesn't end with "<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much you hated

<ital><name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ulin Rouge," </ital>the answer's no.

</line>


<line>
I was so happy to have a place

to stay that I made pancakes.

</line>


<line>
And you kept eating them

so I kept making them.

</line>


<line>
And then you got mad at me

for letting you eat so many pancakes.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u tried to chase me aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the pool,

but you were too h<name type="ORG">un</name>gover

and also full from the pancakes

so instead... you took a nap.

</line>


<line>
And when you woke up, you said,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for the pancakes.

</line>


<line>
-Now get out of my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use."

-I don't remember any of that.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,

just like you wanted.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d. Honestly, you'll probably

be better off wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But we had some good times,

t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh, right?

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d we?

-Right. Well, um, take care.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe you can find a way

to be happy, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
-I really do.

-Yeah, okay.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to get your shit together.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh.

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Rutaba<name type="PERSON">ga</name></name></name> and I are starting a new agency.

</line>


<line>
I want you to come onboard

and write celebrity tweets.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to do that.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st-writer.

</line>


<line>
It's the same as writing a book,

they're just a lot s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rter

and more people read them.

</line>


<line>
All right, but why are you helping me?

</line>


<line>
Because my life is a mess right now and I

compulsively take care of other people

when I don't know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

to take care of myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I was <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ping it was

because you believed in me.

</line>


<line>
I don't.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to my <ital><name type="PERSON">Giggleship</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
For us, it's a place to realize

our higher selves. For the paying public,

it's a place to watch improv and drink

watered-down mar<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ritas for 8.99.

</line>


<line>
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

</line>


<line>
No, no, you just get paid

in experience and stage time.

</line>


<line>
-Which in a way is even better than money.

-Say what?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, We've arrived

at your living quarters.

</line>


<line>
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.

He gets a mattress.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the spirit.

</line>


<line>
And you can use improv to make

this room anything you want it to be.

</line>


<line>
My cabin is exactly like yours,

but when I use my imagination,

it becomes a rich stateroom

with a treasure chest full of booty.

</line>


<line>
I like a big booty, if you know what

I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

But I'm real good at cleaning windows.

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok.

Normally, I'd make a perfectly

but as you can see,

I don't have my book.

-Oh!

-Guards, take this subversive

to the Yes And room.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Hey, what are you doing?

No. Shame on all of you! Just wait

He's right. Our research s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ws

your name is <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're 24, you live on my couch and

you've always seen the good in me some<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>

is not an option.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've seen too much.

-What the hell are you <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do about it?

</line>


<line>
-Stop you. With these.

-Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
-Don't do anything crazy, guys.

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't be serious.

</line>


<line>
-Just get behind me, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

-No sudden moves.

</line>


<line>
Be reasonable.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wouldn't wanna p<name type="ORG">un</name>cture the hull.

<line>

I didn't realize this man was your friend.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, by all means,

go with him, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
But, see, I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught this was the man

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> sabotaged your rock opera.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> constantly abuses you and

makes you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wer with a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>se in the yard.

I invited him to.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he one w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s never said a kind word

to you the entire time you've known him.

</line>


<line>
-Is this your friend, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

-It's more complicated than that.

</line>


<line>
-Is it? We're your friends, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

-<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>re than that, we're a family.

</line>


<line>
-I, uh...

-Hash browns.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I heard hash browns.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rtha, did you see my hash browns?

-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, do you ever turn it off?

</line>


<line>
It was hash browns, not pancakes.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he first morning you stayed with me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u kept making them and I kept eating

them and then I threw up in the pool.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat made you throw up in the pool. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I

got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

</line>


<line>
-But, you said, "I'll clean it up."

-And did I clean it up?

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't.

I had to call the pool cleaner.

</line>


<line>
-Ha, ha.

-And you said,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for letting me stay here.

</line>


<line>
I don't have anywhere else to go."

And I remember when you said that,

</line>


<line>
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"

because I felt good about myself.

</line>


<line>
And I don't feel that way a lot.

</line>


<line>
Letting you stay with me

was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

</line>


<line>
I don't think I ever told you that.

But I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have.

</line>


<line>
Because you're my best friend, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> lie, if you just made all

that up, that was some really good improv.

to the memory of <name type="PERSON">Jerb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>?

And the waiter would say, <name type="PERSON">"<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u</name> want me

</line>


<line>
-And you'd say, "No."

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta fix this.

</line>


<line>
Really? We spent a lot of money

on this plaque, you know?

-And on the t-shirts.
