<nonVerbComm>[<name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> on recording]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>Look alive, bright eyes.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's the morning and somebody loves you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Right back at you, buddy.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God. He's here.

-There he is.

</line>


<line>
-I love you, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

-I love you, too.

</line>


<line>
Idea for a new <name type="ORG">Pixar</name> movie:

what are pizza boxes thinking about?

</line>


<line>
-And Leland <name type="ORG">Stanford</name>?

-<name type="ORG">Trans</name>continental Railroad.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="ORG">Trans</name>continental Railroad?

-That is correct.

</line>


<line>
Next question,

what is my favorite kind of berry?

</line>


<line>
-Barry <name type="GPE">Bostwick</name>.

-Raspberry?

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,

of course, was Barry <name type="GPE">Bostwick</name>.

</line>


<line>
-How was I supposed to know?

-He also likes Franken Berry.

</line>


<line>
-We would have accepted Franken Berry.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry, you lose.

-What the...?

</line>


<line>
That's our show, but before we go

I wanna send out a quick message.

</line>


<line>
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you

and I know you're doing great things.

</line>


<line>
Idea for a new app: an <name type="ORG">un</name>do button

that could <name type="ORG">un</name>do long amo<name type="ORG">un</name>ts of time.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!

-Three months. A year. A life.

</line>


<line>
Erica, where did that tooth come from?

All right, let's keep this party going.

</line>


<line>
One click and everything could

just go back to the way it was.

</line>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-[BoJack] Hey.

</line>


<line>
-You're still here?

-Yup. Still here.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[snoring, then gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Stop it.

-Wake up, captain <name type="GPE">dumbshi</name>t.

</line>


<line>
I've been trying to get in touch

with you for two months.

</line>


<line>
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

</line>


<line>
Aah! What is it?

</line>


<line>
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them

to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

</line>


<line>
-Are you dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k?

-Only on adventure. And gin.

</line>


<line>
And vodka. And gin.

</line>


<line>
They're not gonna sue you.

They finished the movie.

</line>


<line>
-What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.

-I don't know, ask <name type="ORG">Turtel</name>taub.

</line>


<line>
That's not why I'm here.

I thought you were in <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>.

</line>


<line>
You've been here this whole time?

</line>


<line>
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn

should do... Shut up.

</line>


<line>
Get dressed.

We're going to the orphanage.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]</nonVerbComm> What orphanage?

</line>


<line>
Remember at Herb's f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral,

I asked you what you wanted me to do

</line>


<line>
-with your <ital><name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d </ital>residuals?

-I do... not remember that.

</line>


<line>
You said, "Give it to an orphanage

or something."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It turns out you made enough money

</line>


<line>
to build a brand new one.

So congratulations. You're a hero.

</line>


<line>
A hero?

</line>


<line>
That's right, a hero.

</line>


<line>
Or is it prono<name type="ORG">un</name>ced "gyro?"

I just call them subs.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,

you're a great man.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to

The BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man Orphanage.

</line>


<line>
Or, as we call it,

The BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>phanage.

</line>


<line>
You cannot call it that.

</line>


<line>
A, because I am not a great man and B,

because that is a really stupid name.

</line>


<line>
-The name was Molly's idea.

-Stop pissing off the orphans.

</line>


<line>
A lot of them grow up

to be serial killers.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for that lovely song.

But I'm not a good person.

</line>


<line>
This is the only good thing I've ever done

and I did it by accident.

</line>


<line>
And it just goes to show you

life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

</line>


<line>
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.

You're the ones with the dead parents.

</line>


<line>
-My parents are dead?

-No. No. Not necessarily.

</line>


<line>
Maybe they just didn't want you.

</line>


<line>
My point is,

I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand how people live.

</line>


<line>
It's amazing to me that people

wake up every morning

</line>


<line>
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."

How do people do it?

</line>


<line>
I don't know how.

</line>


<line>
Yay.

</line>


<line>
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser

must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

</line>


<line>
-And I'm not just talking about the butt.

-Ha.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>, how do you always come

up with these amazing butt jokes?

</line>


<line>
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,

you don't come up with butt jokes.

</line>


<line>
You live truthfully in the moment

and the butt joke comes to you.

</line>


<line>
So true. So wise.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I need to "shove off,"

as we sailors say,

on my comedy cruise line, the <ital>Giggleship.</ital>

I shan't be returning.

</line>


<line>
-Shan't you?

-I shannot.

</line>


<line>
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,

as my <name type="ORG">Nu</name>mber Two

and I don't mean<ital> that</ital> kind of number two.

</line>


<line>
What, number two, how do you do that?

</line>


<line>
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz

who cost me 50 grand.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of

production. If there's anything I can do.

</line>


<line>
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

</line>


<line>
-We fixed the whole thing in post.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Remember your first week, these nerds

made a computer scan of your head

so we could finish

if something happened?

</line>


<line>
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

</line>


<line>
Something happened to you,

so these nerds finished the movie.

</line>


<line>
Look what Computer BoJack can do.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Help you out of that tree, ma'am?</ital>

-Look at him save that cat.

</line>


<line>
Now there's a protagonist

we can root for.

</line>


<line>
-You did all that in the computer?

-Not just that.

</line>


<line>
Computer BoJack had so much charisma

and screen presence we ended up going back

</line>


<line>
-and replacing you in every scene.

-I'm not in the movie at all?

</line>


<line>
Not technically, but computer you

is giving the performance of your career.

</line>


<line>
When people see what you do in this movie,

they are gonna storm

Daniel Day-Lewis's house,

schlep him out into the street,

shoot him in the head.

</line>


<line>
That's how good your performance is.

</line>


<line>
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis

look like shit.

</line>


<line>
-They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.

-But it's not my performance.

</line>


<line>
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.

She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.

</line>


<line>
Are you <name type="NORP">Jew</name>ish? Because I feel

some of these you're just making up.

</line>


<line>
We got a screening this weekend.

</line>


<line>
Come see the movie,

we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,

schlemiel, <name type="GPE">schlimazel</name>,

Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

</line>


<line>
Just think, Carolyn,

in one week, all of this will be ours.

</line>


<line>
We should a put a social-media desk there.

</line>


<line>
If we hire someone to micromanage

our clients' online personas

and new media outreach, they'll seem

more gro<name type="ORG">un</name>ded down to earth.

</line>


<line>
Smiling poop emoji,

I love everything about that.

</line>


<line>
I wanna make sure the couches

we get are really comfortable.

</line>


<line>
-Just in case we have some late nights.

-[laughs] Mr. Rabitowitz.

</line>


<line>
This is a place of business.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment

for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond?

</line>


<line>
I just wanna remember this instant

where for once in my life,

</line>


<line>
-everything was going--

-Hold that thought.

</line>


<line>
What is it?

</line>


<line>
Ugh. My wife and I are going

to the ballet tonight,

there's a real ish

with the restaurant.

</line>


<line>
-This is the wife you're divorcing, right?

-You know how it is.

</line>


<line>
You say you want a divorce

and she says, "No, we can make this work."

</line>


<line>
You go to co<name type="ORG">un</name>seling and

remember why you fell in love with her

in the first place

and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
We've been sleeping together

for three months.

</line>


<line>
-We're about to start a company together.

-None of that has to change.

</line>


<line>
I am definitely going to divorce

her probably, it's just...

</line>


<line>
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone

who's never been married.

</line>


<line>
-Listen, this is--

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
Sorry, Katie just said something f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I gotta hop. I love you, though.

</line>


<line>
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning,

I'll be back in a-- Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.

I'm going away for a while.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, where?

-The <ital>Giggleship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's the comedy cruise line

<ital>People </ital>magazine

</line>


<line>
-once called "a comedy cruise line."

-Comedy cruise line?

</line>


<line>
Oh right, your improv thing.

How was your, uh, graduation show?

</line>


<line>
-It was two months ago. You missed it.

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
-No, you're not.

-Well...

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you remember the morning

after my first night here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know why everyone keeps asking

if I remember things. I don't.

</line>


<line>
Just as a general rule,

if your question begins, "Do you remember"

and doesn't end with "how much you hated

<ital><name type="ORG">Moulin Rouge</name>," </ital>the answer's no.

</line>


<line>
I was so happy to have a place

to stay that I made pancakes.

</line>


<line>
And you kept eating them

so I kept making them.

</line>


<line>
And then you got mad at me

for letting you eat so many pancakes.

</line>


<line>
You tried to chase me aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d the pool,

but you were too h<name type="ORG">un</name>gover

and also full from the pancakes

so instead... you took a nap.

</line>


<line>
And when you woke up, you said,

"Thanks for the pancakes.

</line>


<line>
-Now get out of my house."

-I don't remember any of that.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,

just like you wanted.

</line>


<line>
Good. Honestly, you'll probably

be better off without me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But we had some good times,

though, right?

</line>


<line>
-Did we?

-Right. Well, um, take care.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I hope you can find a way

to be happy, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-I really do.

-Yeah, okay.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Todd?

</line>


<line>
You need to get your shit together.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh.

-<name type="ORG">Rutabaga</name> and I are starting a new agency.

</line>


<line>
I want you to come onboard

and write celebrity tweets.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know how to do that.

-You're a ghost-writer.

</line>


<line>
It's the same as writing a book,

they're just a lot shorter

and more people read them.

</line>


<line>
All right, but why are you helping me?

</line>


<line>
Because my life is a mess right now and I

compulsively take care of other people

when I don't know how

to take care of myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I was hoping it was

because you believed in me.

</line>


<line>
I don't.

</line>


<line>
Welcome to my <ital>Giggleship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
For us, it's a place to realize

our higher selves. For the paying public,

it's a place to watch improv and drink

watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

</line>


<line>
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

</line>


<line>
No, no, you just get paid

in experience and stage time.

</line>


<line>
-Which in a way is even better than money.

-Say what?

</line>


<line>
Look, We've arrived

at your living quarters.

</line>


<line>
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.

He gets a mattress.

</line>


<line>
That's the spirit.

</line>


<line>
And you can use improv to make

this room anything you want it to be.

</line>


<line>
My cabin is exactly like yours,

but when I use my imagination,

it becomes a rich stateroom

with a treasure chest full of booty.

</line>


<line>
I like a big booty, if you know what

I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You really are the master

of spontaneous witticisms.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right, you ready? This is go time.

There's no turning back now.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I am ready.

-Great.

</line>


<line>
Now let's get out there and tell all those

garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

what we really think of them,

once and for all.

</line>


<line>
Everyone. We have an anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cement.

</line>


<line>
-[crying]

-Guys, we have an anno<name type="ORG">un</name>cement.

</line>


<line>
-What's going on?

-Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

</line>


<line>
-He had a stroke.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know what you rat bastards

can stroke?

</line>


<line>
-Uh... Oh.

-My big, hairy...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, we burned that bridge.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Todd, you should be up a magician's

sleeve because you are a card.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[shouting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

</line>


<line>
-He refused to scrub the floors.

-Oh, Bryan.

</line>


<line>
Please. My knees were cramping

so I needed to stand.

</line>


<line>
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.

Look.

</line>


<line>
That's solid space-work.

Bryan, don't worry.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go to <name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>

and get this sorted out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>? Uh, <name type="ORG">Copernicus</name>?

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
<ital>One H<name type="ORG">un</name>dred and One Butt Jokes?</ital>

</line>


<line>
"No parking in the rear?"

[laughs] Aah!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="ORG">Copernicus</name> is a fraud!

-A fraud? Me? Ow.

</line>


<line>
-Aah.

-I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Normally, I'd make a perfectly

timed butt joke here,

but as you can see,

I don't have my book.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Guards, take this subversive

to the Yes And room.

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Hey, what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait

till you see my Trip Advisor review.

</line>


<line>
This cruise is getting three stars.

</line>


<line>
Because I have very

mixed feelings about it.

</line>


<line>
-Carolyn, we are free.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Real quick, kiss me once.

Then kiss me twice.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to do that anymore.

</line>


<line>
-I told you, we can make this work--

-No. I don't want--

</line>


<line>
Carolyn, you're a single woman

in your 40s.

</line>


<line>
-Can you really afford to be picky?

-What?

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying, what, you think you're

gonna find some perfect <name type="ORG">un</name>attached guy

who's gonna love you like I do?

</line>


<line>
Who's gonna make you laugh

and feel good about yourself?

</line>


<line>
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

</line>


<line>
If you're holding out

for something better,

well, I hate to break it to you, but

you're gonna be alone for a long time.

</line>


<line>
I'm not afraid of being alone.

</line>


<line>
And you might wanna find

someplace else to work

</line>


<line>
-because you're not coming with me.

-Wait, wait, wait, what?

</line>


<line>
It's my company.

My name is on all the paperwork.

</line>


<line>
I think I can do it without you.

Good luck.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa, Carolyn, we just-- Come... Carolyn.

-My name is Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack voice-over]</nonVerbComm>

<ital>And as I held that baby in my arms,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I knew I had been given a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond chance.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>A chance to finally make things right.</ital>

<ital>And this time, I was gonna win...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>the race of life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Rock music playing]

-[crowd cheering]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa. That was actually good.

-We're doing a full awards push.

</line>


<line>
You should clear your schedule

for the next year.

</line>


<line>
Buckle up, buddy,

this is the year of <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

</line>


<line>
But it wasn't <name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat.

And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

</line>


<line>
What difference does it make?

Smile and collect your trophies.

</line>


<line>
-You know Ana Spanikopita?

-Hello.

</line>


<line>
-Aah!

-They call her the Oscar whisperer.

</line>


<line>
-Ana Spanikopita. Big fan.

-Thank you, it's--

</line>


<line>
I meant you are going to be

a big fan of me

because I am going

to win you an Oscar.

</line>


<line>
Ana is the best there is.

</line>


<line>
-You better start writing your speech.

-I don't have to thank my parents, do I?

</line>


<line>
You're f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny.

I am literally laughing out loud.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-We gotta get you on a talk show.

</line>


<line>
You have any weird history

with Kelly Ripa I should know about?

</line>


<line>
-No. Well, define "weird."

-You look doughy. Do you r<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Cardio? Anything?

-I mean, occasionally.

</line>


<line>
Excuse me?

That was such a beautiful performance.

</line>


<line>
-So brave.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Everyone here loves you.

Do you feel that?

</line>


<line>
-Feel that energy!

-They don't love me.

</line>


<line>
-They don't know me.

-That's why they love you.

</line>


<line>
He's right. Our research shows

<name type="GPE">America</name> likes to <ital>think</ital> they know you,

and then they like learning more

about you, but at a certain point

they pass a threshold where they actually

know you and then they find you weird

and off-putting.

</line>


<line>
Are you saying that nobody who really

knows me could ever love me?

</line>


<line>
-No, no, no. Not nobody. No.

-No.

</line>


<line>
What am I doing here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know where you're going,

but if you could r<name type="ORG">un</name> there.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Sextina</name>, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.

I'm really excited to be working with you.

</line>


<line>
Listen, chitch, if you're going

to tweet for <name type="ORG">Sextina</name> <name type="GPE">Aquafina</name>,

you need to capture the essence

of my personal brand, okay?

</line>


<line>
All upper caps, no p<name type="ORG">un</name>ctuation, lots

of cryptic bullshit about the <name type="ORG">Illuminati</name>

and make sure to mention

my preferred brands, okay?

</line>


<line>
Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch

and [clicking] brand fin polish.

</line>


<line>
-Can you spell that last one?

-No.

</line>


<line>
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.

</line>


<line>
Hey, thank you so much.

You people are the real stars. Huh?

</line>

<ital>Hi. I'm Sarah Koenig.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>This is one ringtone told over</ital>

<ital>the course of several rings.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And the story it's telling you</ital>

<ital>is to answer your phone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Hey, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Hey. Uh...

</line>


<line>
So... How's <name type="GPE">Cordovia</name>?

</line>


<line>
It's... hard.

</line>


<line>
-Do you know where the batteries are?

-What?

</line>


<line>
-The batteries in the remote died.

-Did you check the j<name type="ORG">un</name>k drawer?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I looked in the j<name type="ORG">un</name>k drawer.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna take them

out of the smoke detector.

</line>


<line>
-No, don't do that.

-Well, I'm out of options.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I know this so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds crazy, but I

think maybe you should get back here

</line>


<line>
-so you can help me find the batteries.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
I know you're doing important work

and it's a long way to travel,

but I need you here

and I think you should come home.

</line>


<line>
-Is that really what you want?

-Of course it is.

</line>


<line>
Well, okay, I'm looking

at this website right now

and it says if I leave immediately,

I can still make it home tonight.

</line>


<line>
-That so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds great.

-I love you.

</line>


<line>
I love you, too, Diane.

You know, it's the f<name type="ORG">un</name>niest thing.

</line>


<line>
There is a woman in this restaurant

who looks just like you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

I guess I just have one of those faces.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all shouting and laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, party people,

we have time for one more suggestion.

</line>


<line>
-Todd.

-Did someone say movie theater?

</line>


<line>
I heard movie theater.

</line>


<line>
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear

my giant hat to the movies.

</line>


<line>
Who's this sitting behind me?

John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, it's me, BoJack.

-BoJack?

</line>


<line>
-Todd, I'm getting you out of here.

-I can't leave.

</line>


<line>
I need to take suggestions.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, here's a suggestion,

your name is Todd.

</line>


<line>
You're 24, you live on my couch and

you've always seen the good in me somehow.

</line>


<line>
You've been brainwashed into thinking

that you belong here, but you don't.

You belong back home.

</line>


<line>
If you're any kind of improviser,

you'll take that suggestion

and you'll r<name type="ORG">un</name> with it.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
Let's get out of here.

</line>


<line>
I'm afraid that getting out of here

is not an option.

</line>


<line>
-You've seen too much.

-What the hell are you gonna do about it?

</line>


<line>
-Stop you. With these.

-Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
-Don't do anything crazy, guys.

-You can't be serious.

</line>


<line>
-Just get behind me, BoJack.

-No sudden moves.

</line>


<line>
Be reasonable.

You wouldn't wanna p<name type="ORG">un</name>cture the hull.

</line>


<line>
Especially not when I have this

smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

</line>


<line>
-I've lost them. Where did they go?

-Seriously?

</line>


<line>
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

</line>


<line>
Too bad we're wearing s<name type="ORG">un</name>screen

with SPF a million which protects

against flamethrowers.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
Now we finish this

with our strangle machine.

</line>


<line>
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

</line>


<line>
-Strangle those guys.

-Ugh! [coughs] BoJack, help.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
There is literally nothing

happening to you.

</line>


<line>
You don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand, if you die

in improv, you die in real life.

</line>


<line>
So stupid. Fine.

I guess I have a guard killing machine?

</line>


<line>
Beep, boop, beep.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> No. I have a wife and children.

</line>


<line>
Well, they're improvised,

but they're real to me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all shouting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Can this be the end?

-This whole ship is full of idiots.

</line>


<line>
Beep, boop.

</line>


<line>
Come on, come on, come on.

</line>


<line>
Come on, come on, Todd.

Almost there.

</line>


<line>
Wait. Where are you going?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, improv is f<name type="ORG">un</name>

and great and everything,

but you guys are <ital>really</ital> into improv.

I'm gonna go with my friend.

</line>


<line>
Your friend?

I didn't realize this man was your friend.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, by all means,

go with him, Todd.

</line>


<line>
But, see, I thought this was the man

who sabotaged your rock opera.

</line>


<line>
The one who constantly abuses you and

makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

</line>


<line>
I invited him to.

</line>


<line>
The one who's never said a kind word

to you the entire time you've known him.

</line>


<line>
-Is this your friend, Todd?

-It's more complicated than that.

</line>


<line>
-Is it? We're your friends, Todd.

-More than that, we're a family.

</line>


<line>
-I, uh...

-Hash browns.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I heard hash browns.

</line>


<line>
-Martha, did you see my hash browns?

-Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?

</line>


<line>
It was hash browns, not pancakes.

The first morning you stayed with me.

</line>


<line>
You kept making them and I kept eating

them and then I threw up in the pool.

</line>


<line>
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I

got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

</line>


<line>
-But, you said, "I'll clean it up."

-And did I clean it up?

</line>


<line>
No. You didn't.

I had to call the pool cleaner.

</line>


<line>
-Ha, ha.

-And you said,

</line>


<line>
"Thank you for letting me stay here.

</line>


<line>
I don't have anywhere else to go."

And I remember when you said that,

</line>


<line>
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"

because I felt good about myself.

</line>


<line>
And I don't feel that way a lot.

</line>


<line>
Letting you stay with me

was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

</line>


<line>
I don't think I ever told you that.

But I should have.

</line>


<line>
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all

that up, that was some really good improv.

</line>


<line>
Game recognize game.

</line>


<line>
-Why do you have a boat?

-Uh, I don't remember.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[distorted ringtone playing on phone]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello? Prince?

-Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

from this <name type="GPE">New York</name> playwright,

she really wants to talk to you.

</line>


<line>
-She says you know her, Jill Pill?

-Jill Pill?

</line>


<line>
Ring any bells?

Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

-No, actually. The other TV show.

</line>


<line>
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

</line>


<line>
I'm moving into the new office

and I got Herb's ashes here.

</line>


<line>
I really don't know what

to do with this thing.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Do you want it?</ital>

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[smashing noise over phone]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Why did I take you with me?

</line>


<line>
Herb loved orphans.

</line>


<line>
Mostly as a delivery apparatus

for hackneyed p<name type="ORG">un</name>chlines

and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

</line>


<line>
And we will do our part

to honor his legacy.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, who's Jerb?

-What?

</line>


<line>
Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"

</line>


<line>
Your e-mail said "Jerb."

I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

</line>


<line>
-Is it not--?

-No, obviously that was a typo.

</line>


<line>
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage

to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

</line>


<line>
Kind of so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like something you'd get

at a <name type="LOC">Mediterranean</name> restaurant,

but wouldn't finish.

</line>


<line>
And the waiter would say, "You want me

to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

</line>


<line>
-And you'd say, "No."

-You gotta fix this.

</line>


<line>
Really? We spent a lot of money

on this plaque, you know?

</line>


<line>
-And on the t-shirts.

<name type="ORG">-Jerb</name>'s kids?

</line>


<line>
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

</line>


<line>
T-shirt's say Jerb

so I'm going by the t-shirts.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know, Herb would probably think

that this is pretty f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny

</line>


<line>
-that you couldn't even get this right.

-Yeah. He would.

</line>


<line>
-So, in a way...

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
You wanna get some

<name type="LOC">Mediterranean</name> food?

</line>


<line>
You read my mind.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, God. L<name type="ORG">un</name>gs on fire.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ow. Crap. I hate this.

R<name type="ORG">un</name>ning is terrible.

</line>


<line>
Everything is the worst.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[continues panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

</line>


<line>
-It gets easier.

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
Every day, it gets a little easier.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah?

-But you gotta do it every day.

</line>


<line>
That's the hard part.

But it does get easier.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.
