He's doing great.

Little of this, little of that.

</line>


<line>
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't check on him, did you?

- Completely forgot.

</line>


<line>
- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you miss the three wise people make

their journey to visit the regular baby?

</line>


<line>
Go to his <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
If he's not there, you must retrieve

something for me,

something of a sensitive nature.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop

calling me, asking me to go on errands.

</line>


<line>
- What do you need?

- A letter I wrote him,

back when we were, prepare yourself,

I'm about to say lovers... <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>vers.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was not enough time to prepare.

- Get off the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne, jerk.

</line>


<line>
It was years ago

and it was quite beautiful

and disgusting all at once.

I remember it fondly. And <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rribly.

</line>


<line>
- What's in the letter?

- None of your concern. I must have it,

for... sentimental reasons. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>dbye.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you have a nice p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne call?

<line>
- I got to go do a thing for someone.

- Fine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u made your appearance,

you were magnificent, I'm very proud.

</line>


<line>
But don't forget, you have a full day

I'm <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly more alarmed

Hello, my precious darling

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I am <ital>not </ital>putting on a pedestal.

</line>


<line>
Just calling for our daily download,

as per Dr. <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>'s

friendly but firm suggestion.

</line>


<line>
When do you think you'll be <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, it might be late.

- Okay, just let me know.

</line>


<line>
I cherish you, I respect you

and you have value.

</line>


<line>
I feel valued and I value you.

</line>


<line>
I am hearing that and I accept that.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane?

- Yes?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you accept my acceptance?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I hear it and I accept it and I value it

and all the other verbs.

</line>

Promise you won't work too hard today?

you won't bother that sk<name type="ORG">un</name>k next door.

my favorite weekday client.

</line>


<line>
- Why are you calling on the weekend?

- I need your help.

</line>


<line>
I've done something bad, very bad.

</line>


<line>
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

</line>


<line>
What? No, it's not. Why would I--

</line>


<line>
Listen, I was sniffing aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

<ital>- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u got to help us.</ital>

I'm sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked, Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn.

Sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked real bad.

Yeah, yeah, we got real bad sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked,

super sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked.

</line>


<line>
- Hardcore.

- Yeah, hardcore sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked.

</line>


<line>
Okay. First things first,

don't go back in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J

because I am in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
Yecch! Okay, don't move.

I'll be there in 20.

</line>


<line>
Mind if I do this real quick?

I gotta pick up a letter.

</line>


<line>
Can we make the appearances

we're supposed to make and go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen you much

since you moved out of my deck chairs.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I've been focusing

on my new job and my marriage and--

</line>


<line>
- And avoiding me?

- I'm not avoiding you.

</line>


<line>
I'm just making an effort

to not be in a room alone with you

</line>


<line>
- because I am... avoiding you.

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, I think we're alike

in a lot of ways.

</line>


<line>
I always tell people

you're like the not-cool version of me.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes that's great,

but it also means we can bring out

the worst in each other.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to get my life back on track.

</line>


<line>
I just think maybe it's better,

for both of us,

if we keep things

a little more professional.

</line>


<line>
Yes, okay. Professional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane being professional.

</line>


<line>
We're at the place I needed to go to.

</line>


<line>
It's so weird I drove here on accident.

</line>


<line>
Might as well r<name type="ORG">un</name> in

and grab that thing I need to get.

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
- I think she's dead.

- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe she's just being a-- a whale?

No, she's dead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe there's someone

in her p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne we can call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, kids these days don't call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey co<name type="PERSON">mm</name><name type="ORG">un</name>icate

via a combination of text messages,

</line>


<line>
- eye rolls, and dick pics.

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
What is it? <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ck pics?

Killer whale, that is.

</line>


<line>
Or s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld I say <ital>killed</ital> whale?

</line>


<line>
- Listen, Officer--

- I told you to freeze.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just became prime suspects

in the case I like to call,

</line>


<line>
"Black and <name type="PERSON">White</name> and Dead All Over,

- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.

- I am a woman, sir.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Can we please s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w a <name type="ORG">un</name>ited front

in front of the perps?

</line>


<line>
- We will talk about this later.

- Aww.

</line>


<line>
Ohh! It smells like a sk<name type="ORG">un</name>k

sk<name type="ORG">un</name>ked another sk<name type="ORG">un</name>k in here,

then they smoked a joint.

What happened?

</line>


<line>
First I rolled all over the couch

to get the sk<name type="ORG">un</name>k stench out,

but that did not work.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I ran into every room to rub myself

on all my clothes and belongings,

to get the Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter smell back.

</line>


<line>
And then I smoked a joint,

so that might be

why it smells like sk<name type="ORG">un</name>k in here.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, I have to fix this

before <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane gets <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hings have been shaky with us

since she pretended

to be out of the co<name type="ORG">un</name>try for two months.

</line>


<line>
And then when I filled our entire <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

with these giant crates

of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

</line>


<line>
Why buy these spaghetti strainers

in the first place?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't even remember.

I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>n, married life is weird.

<line>
We're making an effort

and getting stronger every day,

but I swear to <name type="PERSON">God</name> we are like five

big fights away from a divorce,

<line>

<name type="PERSON">Lindsay</name>, I said "we".

Do you need credit for everything?

</line>


<line>
- I would like credit for something.

- [sarcastic yowl]

</line>


<line>
What do we know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Nadia</name> was not murdered.

She died of a heroin overdose.

</line>


<line>
No one tried to frame me.

All right, back in the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> race.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out, <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name> <name type="PERSON">Clooners</name>.

</line>


<line>
But something's still fishy

about this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le mess,

</line>


<line>
- and it's not just the killer whales.

- Whales are ma<name type="PERSON">mm</name>als, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
- I said it's <ital>not</ital> the whales.

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said it's not <ital>just</ital> the whales.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's more to this story.

What are we missing?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>. What was <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>

doing in his backyard in the first place?

</line>


<line>
What was this "system"?

And where is he now?

</line>


<line>
Why was it so important to <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>

to get that letter back?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, the letter.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his mystery has too many things.

</line>


<line>
I say we go back to the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use and

finally get to the bottom of what's what.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

</line>


<line>
A real <name type="PERSON">Jill</name> Pill jail fail

killer whale caper.

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're doing 50 in a 35.

[<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you're right.

</line>


<line>
I feel so alive.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">T</name>his letter is really graphic.

</line>


<line>
It's all about their magical nights

up at the <name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property?

</line>


<line>
She wrote out the so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds.

What is a "sploink"?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you know <name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>

had an <name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property?

</line>


<line>
Sure. He always loved

to disappear up there.

</line>


<line>
After our s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w got canceled,

he went there for six months.

</line>


<line>
It's f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny, at the time no one knew

where he was and we got really worried.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know what?

</line>


<line>
- I don't see him. Do you?

- <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h.

</line>


<line>
- <ital>I'm <name type="PERSON">T</name>erry Gross and this your ring tone.</ital>

- Shit.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, where the hell are you?

- <name type="ORG">Ojai</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hi? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've been gone all night,

all you have to say is <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, hi?"

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry. <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> and I

were trying to find a killer and--

</line>


<line>
Oh, you're with <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> still?

Well, that explains it. Of course.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter,

I <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand and affirm your feeling--

</line>


<line>
I'm glad you're safe.

I was worried about you.

</line>


<line>
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--

- No, stop.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have to call me.

It doesn't matter what's happening,

doesn't matter

if it's the middle of the night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't keep doing this to me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm coming <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
I'm going back to bed.

We'll talk about this in the morning.

</line>


<line>
- Everything okay?

- No.

</line>


<line>
- Sorry.

- It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
It's my fault.

After <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w</ital>

fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

</line>


<line>
Sure, I wrote a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of hit movies,

I made a ton of money,

but it wasn't fulfilling.

</line>


<line>
I remember when I won my <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>,

standing up on that stage,

looking at the statue and t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught,

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is supposed to be

the happiest moment of my life."

</line>


<line>
And I never felt more miserable.

</line>


<line>
- Oh. Because you're sober?

- Because an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> is meaningless.

</line>


<line>
It's all meaningless.

I dedicated myself to helping others.

</line>


<line>
I turned my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me into a halfway <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

for troubled addicts.

</line>


<line>
I had this system for recovery,

and it helped a lot of them,

but even more slipped through the cracks.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat, too, left me empty.

</line>


<line>
Everyone was worried about you,

you know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't just disappear.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u really hurt a lot of people.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes you need to take responsibility

for your own happiness.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't think that's a little selfish?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to tell you.

I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

</line>


<line>
I'm not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> feel bad about it.

</line>


<line>
It takes a long time to realize

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w truly miserable you are,

even longer to see

it doesn't have to be that way.

</line>


<line>
Only after you give up everything

can you begin to find a way to be happy.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe that guy?

What a nut, right?

</line>


<line>
I just wanna go <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.
