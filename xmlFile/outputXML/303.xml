<line>
What happened to my birthday cake?

</line>


<line>
- Goober.

- It wasn't me.

</line>


<line>
But you're welcome to check my pockets.

</line>


<line>
- Go home, Goober.

- Go home, Goober.

</line>


<line>
- [applause]

- [videotape stops]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Oh, I was a Goober, all right.</ital>

<ital>I Goobed with the best of 'em.</ital>

</line>


<line>
But that ain't me anymore.

</line>


<line>
I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/

number one customer of <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>.

</line>


<line>
At <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>, families come together

to admire the fine female form

of the majestic killer whale.

</line>


<line>
It's educational.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Join us in the Splash Zone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You and your little ones

are gonna get moist.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Whoo-hoo!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>These orcas have the floppiest</ital>

<ital>dorsal fins in town</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and they can't wait to jump</ital>

<ital>through hoops for you and your kids.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Bring your prepubescent daughters,

who are beginning to be cognizant

of a woman's role in the world.

</line>


<line>
They won't internalize

deeply problematic notions

about the commodification

of sexuality in today's society.

</line>


<line>
What are you talking about?

It's just whales.

</line>


<line>
And what about so-called "experts,"

who say it's wrong

to keep these girls in captivity

so they can amuse and entertain us?

</line>


<line>
Well, to those people I say,

"Stop saying that, okay?"

</line>


<line>
These sea girls are my family,

and my business.

</line>


<line>
And they can be yours too.

</line>


<line>
Come on down to <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>,

a fun, sexy time for the whole family.

- Hey, <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>.

- Where are you? I hear mirth.

</line>


<line>
An elementary school all inclusive

non-denominational winter day pageant.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. The snow goblin wants to destroy

our seasonal festivities.

</line>


<line>
"Snow goblin" is an offensive slur.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>.

And you thought your play sucked.

</line>


<line>
- I didn't.

- <ital>Well, regardless.</ital>

</line>


<line>
A lot of these fancy kids'

fancy parents are <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> voters.

</line>


<line>
If I wanna get nominated,

I got to rub elbows

</line>


<line>
and whatever the non-denominational

word for schmooze is.

</line>


<line>
Hobnob. Did you check

on <name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name> like I asked?

</line>


<line>
He's doing great.

Little of this, little of that.

</line>


<line>
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.

</line>


<line>
- You didn't check on him, did you?

- Completely forgot.

</line>


<line>
- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Did you miss the three wise people make

their journey to visit the regular baby?

</line>


<line>
Go to his house.

</line>


<line>
If he's not there, you must retrieve

something for me,

something of a sensitive nature.

</line>


<line>
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop

calling me, asking me to go on errands.

</line>


<line>
- What do you need?

- A letter I wrote him,

back when we were, prepare yourself,

I'm about to say lovers... Lovers.

</line>


<line>
- That was not enough time to prepare.

- Get off the phone, jerk.

</line>


<line>
It was years ago

and it was quite beautiful

and disgusting all at once.

I remember it fondly. And horribly.

</line>


<line>
- What's in the letter?

- None of your concern. I must have it,

for... sentimental reasons. Goodbye.

</line>


<line>
- Did you have a nice phone call?

- Are you in the <name type="ORG">Academy</name>?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- Then I don't care what you think.

</line>


<line>
- I got to go do a thing for someone.

- Fine.

</line>


<line>
You made your appearance,

you were magnificent, I'm very proud.

</line>


<line>
But don't forget, you have a full day

of muckety-muck glad-handing.

</line>


<line>
The Bat Mitzvah,

the senior <name type="ORG">Academy</name> member meet and greet.

</line>


<line>
You'll be wonderful,

I have complete faith in you.

</line>


<line>
That is literally the first time

anyone ever said that to me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, you'll keep up

his Internet presence?

</line>


<line>
I want him trending by this afternoon.

</line>


<line>
But good trending, not bad trending,

you understand?

</line>


<line>
Hashtag you betcha.

</line>


<line>
Did I just say hashtag out loud?

Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!

</line>


<line>
I'm honestly more alarmed

by the "you betcha".

</line>


<line>
I'll take a smoke break

before these little boogers

dig into the refrain

of "<name type="PERSON">Frosty</name> the Non-Gendered Snow Person."

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.

<ital>how did you become a ring tone?</ital>

<nonVerbComm>[Lethem]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You know, <name type="PERSON">Terry</name>,</ital>

<ital>growing up in Brooklyn,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was always fascinated by ring tones</ital>

<ital>and the stories they told.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Hello, my precious darling

slice of sunshine,

who I am <ital>not </ital>putting on a pedestal.

</line>


<line>
Just calling for our daily download,

as per Dr. <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>'s

friendly but firm suggestion.

</line>


<line>
When do you think you'll be home?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, it might be late.

- Okay, just let me know.

</line>


<line>
I cherish you, I respect you

and you have value.

</line>


<line>
I feel valued and I value you.

</line>


<line>
I am hearing that and I accept that.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>?

- Yes?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you accept my acceptance?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I hear it and I accept it and I value it

and all the other verbs.

</line>


<line>
Promise you won't work too hard today?

</line>


<line>
I won't, if you promise me

you won't bother that skunk next door.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to come home

to a stinky husband.

</line>


<line>
That is some great food for thought.

I gotta go right now.

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

my favorite weekday client.

</line>


<line>
- Why are you calling on the weekend?

- I need your help.

</line>


<line>
I've done something bad, very bad.

</line>


<line>
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

</line>


<line>
What? No, it's not. Why would I--

</line>


<line>
Listen, I was sniffing around

where I didn't belong and I got skunked.

</line>


<line>
- What?

<ital>- You got to help us.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Us?

- <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>'s here too.

</line>


<line>
I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.

Skunked real bad.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,

super skunked.

</line>


<line>
- Hardcore.

- Yeah, hardcore skunked.

</line>


<line>
Okay. First things first,

don't go back in the house.

</line>


<line>
Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J

because I am in the house.

</line>


<line>
Yecch! Okay, don't move.

I'll be there in 20.

</line>


<line>
Mind if I do this real quick?

I gotta pick up a letter.

</line>


<line>
Can we make the appearances

we're supposed to make and go home?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen you much

since you moved out of my deck chairs.

</line>


<line>
You know, I've been focusing

on my new job and my marriage and--

</line>


<line>
- And avoiding me?

- I'm not avoiding you.

</line>


<line>
I'm just making an effort

to not be in a room alone with you

</line>


<line>
- because I am... avoiding you.

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
You know, I think we're alike

in a lot of ways.

</line>


<line>
I always tell people

you're like the not-cool version of me.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes that's great,

but it also means we can bring out

the worst in each other.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to get my life back on track.

</line>


<line>
I just think maybe it's better,

for both of us,

if we keep things

a little more professional.

</line>


<line>
Yes, okay. Professional.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> being professional.

Doing our jobs and nothing else.

</line>


<line>
We're at the place I needed to go to.

</line>


<line>
It's so weird I drove here on accident.

</line>


<line>
Might as well run in

and grab that thing I need to get.

</line>


<line>
- Then, back to business.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[creaking]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- It's spooky in here. Too spooky.

- Really?

</line>


<line>
And what would be the right amount

of spooky? <name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, this thing's heavy.

</line>


<line>
Now I know how <name type="PERSON">Hilary Swank</name>'s arms

got so jacked.

</line>


<line>
Put it down, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Does it look weird?

Me with an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>?

</line>


<line>
- I actually think that it feels--

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
- I think she's dead.

- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.

</line>


<line>
Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?

No, she's dead.

</line>


<line>
Maybe there's someone

in her phone we can call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, kids these days don't call.

</line>


<line>
They communicate

via a combination of text messages,

</line>


<line>
- eye rolls, and dick pics.

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
What is it? <name type="PERSON">Dick</name> pics?

See if they spell out a message.

</line>


<line>
- [guns cocking]

- <name type="PERSON">Freeze</name>! <name type="PERSON">Drop</name> the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>!

</line>


<line>
- Oh, man.

- Well, well, well.

</line>


<line>
Or should I say whale, whale, whale?

Killer whale, that is.

</line>


<line>
Or should I say <ital>killed</ital> whale?

</line>


<line>
- Listen, Officer--

- I told you to freeze.

</line>


<line>
You just became prime suspects

in the case I like to call,

</line>


<line>
"Black and <name type="PERSON">White</name> and Dead All Over,

A Whale Of A Crime:

</line>


<line>
An Officer <name type="PERSON">Meow Meow</name> <name type="ORG">Fuzzyface</name> Mystery."

</line>


<line>
Eh...

</line>


<line>
- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.

- I am a woman, sir.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lindsay</name>, you know I am trying.

</line>


<line>
Can we please show a united front

in front of the perps?

</line>


<line>
- We will talk about this later.

- Aww.

</line>


<line>
Ohh! It smells like a skunk

skunked another skunk in here,

then they smoked a joint.

What happened?

</line>


<line>
First I rolled all over the couch

to get the skunk stench out,

but that did not work.

</line>


<line>
Then I ran into every room to rub myself

on all my clothes and belongings,

to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

</line>


<line>
And then I smoked a joint,

so that might be

why it smells like skunk in here.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this

before <name type="PERSON">Diane</name> gets home.

</line>


<line>
Things have been shaky with us

since she pretended

to be out of the country for two months.

</line>


<line>
And then when I filled our entire house

with these giant crates

of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

</line>


<line>
Why buy these spaghetti strainers

in the first place?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't even remember.

I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

</line>


<line>
Man, married life is weird.

</line>


<line>
We're making an effort

and getting stronger every day,

but I swear to <name type="PERSON">God</name> we are like five

big fights away from a divorce,

</line>


<line>
I do not want this to be one.

</line>


<line>
Okay, number first.

We got to get you in a tomato bath.

</line>


<line>
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

</line>


<line>
Is marinara all right,

or will I need something zestier

like Arrabiata?

</line>


<line>
Tomato bath.

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
I am so high right now. [sniffs]

Wait, was there a skunk in here?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- What do you know about <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>?

- Uh, who's <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>?

</line>


<line>
Your friend doing the face-down mambo

in the king-sized bathtub.

</line>


<line>
- Now I know her name is <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>.

- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?

</line>


<line>
Although I am trying to branch

into more serious roles.

</line>


<line>
You pigs think you can march all over us.

But I know my rights.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, what are they?

- I mean, I don't <ital>know them</ital> know them.

</line>


<line>
But I know that I have them.

So, can I check my phone real quick?

</line>


<line>
You're not gonna look up your rights,

are you?

</line>


<line>
What? No.

</line>


<line>
I'm just supposed to moderate

an <name type="PERSON">Emily</name> VanCamp live-chat talkback

on <name type="PERSON">Snapchat</name>.

</line>


<line>
Let me just set up

the user preferences here, and...

you can't detain us

unless we're under arrest.

</line>


<line>
Damn it. You <ital>were </ital>looking up

your rights, weren't you?

</line>


<line>
Nope, that was just a thing

I already knew.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's stupid rights these days.

I never get to have any fun.

</line>


<line>
- Let's get out of here.

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, I need to show you something.

</line>


<line>
This is <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>'s phone.

</line>


<line>
I did not know you were such a klepto.

I can buy you a new phone.

</line>


<line>
Check this out,

the last text message she sent.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is going to kill me?"

</line>


<line>
I think someone's trying to frame you,

for murder.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, we're gonna be late

for the Bat Mitzvah.

</line>


<line>
We got to get to <name type="GPE">Brentwood</name>.

</line>


<line>
At this time of day?

It's gonna be... murder.

</line>


<line>

<line>
<ital><music>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</music></ital>

Hey!

</line>


<line>
I can't believe

you're not more concerned about this.

</line>


<line>
- Someone is implicating you in a murder.

- I can be two things at once.

</line>


<line>
I am very concerned,

but also very proud

that today <name type="PERSON">Tovah</name> is a woman.

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>,

potential <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> nominee.

</line>

I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>- Shabbat shalom.</ital>

<ital>- Shabbat shalom</ital> to you.

</line>


<line>
We need to figure out who's behind this.

Call <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>, find out what she knows.

</line>


<line>
Good thinking.

</line>


<line>
If I go to jail, that will throw

a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.

</line>


<line>
The <name type="ORG">Academy</name> does not look kindly

on murder.

</line>


<line>
Rape, they don't seem

to have a problem with.

</line>


<line>
Be careful. <name type="PERSON">Jill</name> could be the one

trying to set you up.

</line>


<line>
She did send us to the house.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Backstrom</name>, turn it down a notch.

Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?

</line>


<line>
This is a crucial weekend

for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> brand awareness.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to tweet?

"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

</line>


<line>
- Hashtag murder party"?

- No, obviously.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm> Bat Mitzvah in <name type="GPE">Brentwood</name>.

Hashtag Jewish stuff.

</line>


<line>
- [<name type="PERSON">Jill</name>] <ital><name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.</ital>

- Hey, <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>.

</line>


<line>
You're not trying to frame me

for murder, are you?

</line>


<line>
<ital>- What?</ital>

- Can you take this seriously?

</line>


<line>
Can you take <ital>this </ital>seriously?

</line>


<line>
You find the letter? Check in the vent

behind the water feeder.

</line>


<line>
I've been pretty tied up

at <name type="PERSON">Drake</name>'s cousin's Bat Mitzvah.

</line>


<line>
Did you know <name type="PERSON">Drake</name>'s cousin was Jewish?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up?

Get the letter.

</line>


<line>
This is why I couldn't live in <name type="GPE">New York</name>.

Everyone's so bossy.

</line>


<line>
Also, what's with the pizza

by the slice thing?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="GPE">New York</name>,

either eat a pizza or don't.

</line>


<line>
I'm calling the last person

<name type="PERSON">Nadia</name> was in contact with before she died.

</line>


<line>
Maybe she knows something.

</line>


<line>
- [female]<ital> <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>?</ital>

- No, this is--

</line>


<line>
<ital>Where you been? Boys upstairs</ital>

<ital>are getting real sick of you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Goober]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Get off the phone,</ital>

<ital>Skinny <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>. You're on the clock.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[female]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I gotta go.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- That man's voice sounded familiar.

- Yeah, super familiar.

</line>


<line>
Something about that voice

made me want to tell it to go home.

</line>


<line>
- [gasps] It's Goober.

- [gasps] Goober.

</line>


<line>
That guy never went home.

</line>


<line>
Except for that one episode

"Goober Goes Home,"

because we were

on a softball team together

and the home was home plate.

</line>


<line>
They must be at <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay, good. Because I absolutely

want to get to the bottom of this.

</line>


<line>
Can we at least wait

until after they lift the chair?

</line>


<line>
- That is my favorite part.

- Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, I taste delicious.

</line>


<line>
How you boys doing in there?

</line>


<line>
- Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.

- Oh, no, the stain.

</line>


<line>
- Me three.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
You took your bath together?

</line>


<line>
Lena <name type="PERSON">Dunham</name> takes baths with her friends

and no one gives her shit.

</line>


<line>
Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.

Do not shake.

</line>


<line>
- The sauce is so sticky and wet.

- Don't shake.

</line>


<line>
It's dripping all over my body.

I gotta shake!

</line>


<line>
- Aaah!

- [Princess Carolyn] Aah!

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[shuddering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, look, that made things worse.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.

You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

</line>


<line>
You got it, chief.

<name type="PERSON">Hooray</name>! Following instructions.

</line>


<line>
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

</line>


<line>
You're not putting emojis in, are you?

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> don't tweet emojis.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>? Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>!

- Oh, hey... you.

</line>


<line>
I haven't seen you in forever.

</line>


<line>
- You came to see your old friend.

- Uh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
All this time

I thought you forgot about me.

</line>


<line>
Things haven't been so swell with me

since the show ended.

</line>


<line>
- Not like you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Movie Star</name>.

- [chuckles] Okay, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Just knowing that you care about me

and would come patronize

my place of business,

</line>


<line>
- it really means a lot.

- You got it, Goober.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober

for 20 years.

</line>


<line>
- You can call me by my real name.

- Okay, maybe I will.

</line>


<line>
Right now, call me by my real name.

I want to hear you.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I want to say <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>... bert.

Goobert?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you?

</line>


<line>
- No, we did, but--

- I get it. I'm a big joke.

</line>


<line>
"Let's all go down to <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>

and laugh at Goober.

</line>


<line>
We'll have a whale of a good time

at Goober's expense.

</line>


<line>
He's always good for a laugh."

</line>


<line>
I should've known better

than to get my hopes up.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
We're looking for one of your strippers,

Skinny <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>?

</line>


<line>
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

We don't employ strippers here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Whale World</name> is a family establishment,

where children of all ages

have a fun, sexy time.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Skinny <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>,

get that sweet tail over here!

</line>


<line>
You got a customer. You enjoy yourself.

</line>


<line>
- Well, hello, land mammals.

- [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
We're just here to ask you some questions

about your friend <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm on the clock. You want to chat?

</line>


<line>
Buy me a private dance

in the Blowhole Room.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, please.

- Ugh, gross. Private dance?

</line>


<line>
But if that's the only way she'll talk,

then fine.

</line>


<line>
Fine, I'm offended. <name type="PERSON">Yuck</name>.

</line>


<line>
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.

</line>


<line>
- But gross.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
Oh, um, you can dance however

you want. Don't do this for my benefit.

</line>


<line>
Tango, waltz, salsa.

I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.

</line>


<line>
- How would you dance then?

- Like a stripper, probably.

</line>


<line>
Listen, we have some bad news.

Your friend <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name> is dead.

</line>


<line>
- Not surprised.

- You're not?

</line>


<line>
A lot of girls like her come through here.

<name type="PERSON">Sweet</name>, vulnerable.

</line>


<line>
This place takes 'em

and makes 'em a lot of promises.

</line>


<line>
They say they're gonna take care of you,

make you big like <name type="PERSON">Shamu</name>.

</line>


<line>
But once your body gets too banged up,

they don't want you no more.

</line>


<line>
- Thar she blows, then thar she goes.

- Shit.

</line>


<line>
Watch your mouth, lady.

There are children here.

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- [giggling]

</line>


<line>
What do you know about <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>'s

relationship with <name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>?

</line>


<line>
Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

</line>


<line>
His house has been abandoned

for months, though. That's all I know.

</line>


<line>
- That's it?

- That's it.

</line>


<line>
A bunch of girls used to hang out.

</line>


<line>
He had some sort of system.

Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.

</line>


<line>
- What do you mean, "system"?

- I have already said too much.

</line>


<line>
A system is a formulated method

or plan of procedure.

</line>


<line>
- I know what the word "system" means--

- But that's all I can say.

</line>


<line>
That text that <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name> sent you,

"<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is going to kill me."

</line>


<line>
Any idea what that's about?

</line>


<line>
Hey, I don't know nothing about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
How do you not know about <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

I am very famous.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">Time</name>'s up.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, if you really want to know

about all that stuff,

come by here real late.

</line>


<line>
There's an after-hours party.

But that's all I can say.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

</line>


<line>
Say you got <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> with you.

That'll get you in. Okay, that's it.

</line>


<line>
Is <name type="PERSON">Wilbur</name> coming today?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wilbur</name>'s not real. He was a character

on a TV show you were on.

</line>


<line>
- Oh. Are my kids coming today?

- Um...

</line>


<line>
- No.

- Hey there, fella.

</line>


<line>
Can't wait for you to see <ital>Secretariat,</ital>

think you're gonna love it.

</line>


<line>
Hey, old pal.

Hope you remember how to vote.

</line>


<line>
We have to go

to this <name type="ORG">Whale World</name> party.

</line>


<line>
I know I should go,

I'm invested in figuring out

who's trying to frame me for murder.

</line>


<line>
Are you sure you wanna go with me?

Outside of work hours?

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

</line>


<line>
Sorry about what I said.

</line>


<line>
I was embarrassed by the person I was

when I was staying with you.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying not to be that person.

</line>


<line>
I make you unhappy?

Is that what you're saying?

</line>


<line>
It's not about being happy.

That's the thing.

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying to get through each day.

</line>


<line>
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"

</line>


<line>
It just makes me more miserable.

</line>


<line>
Can I get a photo with the star?

</line>


<line>
- Of course.

- Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I believe in it,

real lasting happiness.

</line>


<line>
All those perky, well-adjusted people

you see in movies and TV shows?

</line>


<line>
- I don't think they exist.

- No one's happy all the time.

</line>


<line>
- You have to focus on the small things.

- Right.

</line>


<line>
- Like winning an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

- Right.

</line>


<line>
Hey, old pal.

Look at this guy, still alive.

</line>


<line>
Hope your voting finger works.

</line>


<line>
- What happened out here?

- You told us to get rid of the clothes.

</line>


<line>
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.

They're never coming back.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cackling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You two are impossible.

Why did you even call me here?

</line>


<line>
Because you're Princess Carolyn,

you can fix anything.

</line>


<line>
That's true.

But you can't start a fire on your lawn.

</line>


<line>
There's a drought and--

There's a drought.

</line>


<line>
You, thoughtful husband that you are,

got rid of your lawn,

and replaced it

with drought-resistant landscaping.

</line>


<line>
This could work.

I got to make a few phone calls.

</line>


<line>
Aw, thanks. You're the best.

</line>


<line>
I tell you, I've got half a mind

to go over

and give it to that skunk

for starting this whole darn thing.

</line>


<line>
No. You go inside to your spot

and stay there while I fix this.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...

- Stay. Stay.

</line>


<line>
- Stay.

- [whimpers]

</line>


<line>
- [dance music playing]

- Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
- I, uh...

- Living the nightlife.

</line>


<line>
Hashtag feeling good about myself

and my choices.

</line>


<line>
Aah!

</line>


<line>
Hey, look.

</line>


<line>
Let's definitely follow that guy.

</line>


<line>
- Ladies first.

- What a gentleman.

</line>


<line>
Ohh.

</line>


<line>
- Whoa.

- Ooh.

</line>


<line>
Ohh. Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

<nonVerbComm>[phone]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I'm <name type="PERSON">Terry</name> Gross</ital>

<ital>I'm here with--</ital>

<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> kills?

</line>


<line>
Something tells me that's not a reference

to your old stand-up act.

</line>


<line>
Was that necessary?

</line>


<line>
- What do you want?

- I'm with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? Let me see.

</line>


<line>
- See what?

- Let me see some <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
- [sighs] Fine.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, you didn't kill <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>.

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> did.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- [<name type="PERSON">Diane</name> grunts]

</line>


<line>
Nighty-night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Wakey</name>, wakey.

</line>


<line>
- [groaning]

- So, you got a little curious, huh?

</line>


<line>
Thought you'd go sticking your little nose

where it doesn't belong?

</line>


<line>
What's the play here?

Trying to get a cut of my smack biz?

</line>


<line>
What? No, Goober.

</line>


<line>
- You know my real name.

- I actually seriously don't.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We just wanted to know why everyone

was talking about how <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> kills?

</line>


<line>
Why would you implicate me

in your drug business?

</line>


<line>
Wait, I get what happened.

</line>


<line>
You resented me all these years.

My fame, your obscurity.

</line>


<line>
You made me the face of this drug,

because to you my face is a symbol

for the opiate of show business.

</line>


<line>
- No, man. You played The Horse.

- Huh?

</line>


<line>
- Horse is a nickname for heroin.

- What?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>. Horse. Heroin.

- Uh-huh. Uh...

</line>


<line>
Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

</line>


<line>
- Police!

- Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, not again.

</line>


<line>
Gotcha!

<name type="PERSON">Richie Osborne</name>, you're under arrest.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, right, <name type="PERSON">Reggie</name>.

- Richie.

</line>


<line>
- That's what I said. I said Rickie.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
Thank <name type="PERSON">God</name>. How did you find us?

</line>


<line>
Your Twitter account is hooked up

to your phone's location services.

</line>


<line>
We've been tracking you

through your tweets all night.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I've been tracking you

all night.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lindsay</name>, I said "we".

Do you need credit for everything?

</line>


<line>
- I would like credit for something.

- [sarcastic yowl]

</line>


<line>
What do we know?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Nadia</name> was not murdered.

She died of a heroin overdose.

</line>


<line>
No one tried to frame me.

All right, back in the <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> race.

</line>


<line>
Look out, <name type="PERSON">Jurj</name> <name type="PERSON">Clooners</name>.

</line>


<line>
But something's still fishy

about this whole mess,

</line>


<line>
- and it's not just the killer whales.

- Whales are mammals, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
- I said it's <ital>not</ital> the whales.

- You said it's not <ital>just</ital> the whales.

</line>


<line>
There's more to this story.

What are we missing?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>. What was <name type="PERSON">Nadia</name>

doing in his backyard in the first place?

</line>


<line>
What was this "system"?

And where is he now?

</line>


<line>
Why was it so important to <name type="PERSON">Jill</name>

to get that letter back?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, the letter.

This mystery has too many things.

</line>


<line>
I say we go back to the house and

finally get to the bottom of what's what.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

</line>


<line>
A real <name type="PERSON">Jill</name> Pill jail fail

killer whale caper.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>]</nonVerbComm> You're doing 50 in a 35.

[<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you're right.

</line>


<line>
I feel so alive.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> This letter is really graphic.

</line>


<line>
It's all about their magical nights

up at the <name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property?

</line>


<line>
She wrote out the sounds.

What is a "sploink"?

</line>


<line>
Did you know <name type="ORG">Cuddlywhiskers</name>

had an <name type="ORG">Ojai</name> property?

</line>


<line>
Sure. He always loved

to disappear up there.

</line>


<line>
After our show got canceled,

he went there for six months.

</line>


<line>
It's funny, at the time no one knew

where he was and we got really worried.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know what?

</line>


<line>
- I don't see him. Do you?

- Huh.

</line>


<line>
- <ital>I'm <name type="PERSON">Terry</name> Gross and this your ring tone.</ital>

- Shit.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, where the hell are you?

- <name type="ORG">Ojai</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,

all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry. <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and I

were trying to find a killer and--

</line>


<line>
Oh, you're with <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> still?

Well, that explains it. Of course.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I understand and affirm your feeling--

</line>


<line>
I'm glad you're safe.

I was worried about you.

</line>


<line>
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--

- No, stop.

</line>


<line>
You have to call me.

It doesn't matter what's happening,

doesn't matter

if it's the middle of the night.

</line>


<line>
You can't keep doing this to me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

</line>


<line>
I'm going back to bed.

We'll talk about this in the morning.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Everything okay?

- No.

</line>


<line>
- Sorry.

- It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
It's my fault.

</line>


<line>
- [gasps]

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Mmm.

</line>


<line>
After <ital>The <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name> Show</ital>

fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

</line>


<line>
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,

I made a ton of money,

but it wasn't fulfilling.

</line>


<line>
I remember when I won my <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>,

standing up on that stage,

looking at the statue and thought,

</line>


<line>
"This is supposed to be

the happiest moment of my life."

</line>


<line>
And I never felt more miserable.

</line>


<line>
- Oh. Because you're sober?

- Because an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name> is meaningless.

</line>


<line>
It's all meaningless.

I dedicated myself to helping others.

</line>


<line>
I turned my home into a halfway house

for troubled addicts.

</line>


<line>
I had this system for recovery,

and it helped a lot of them,

but even more slipped through the cracks.

</line>


<line>
That, too, left me empty.

</line>


<line>
Everyone was worried about you,

you know.

</line>


<line>
You can't just disappear.

You really hurt a lot of people.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes you need to take responsibility

for your own happiness.

</line>


<line>
You don't think that's a little selfish?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to tell you.

I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.

</line>


<line>
It takes a long time to realize

how truly miserable you are,

even longer to see

it doesn't have to be that way.

</line>


<line>
Only after you give up everything

can you begin to find a way to be happy.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe that guy?

What a nut, right?

</line>


<line>
I just wanna go home.
