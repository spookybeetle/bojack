</line>


<line>
Just for a couple of days.

</line>


<line>
What is going on over there?

</line>


<line>
-It's a minor injury issue.

-A st<name type="ORG">un</name>t went slightly awry.

</line>


<line>
A<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in?

</line>


<line>
And one of our stars

got a little strangled.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Just a little strangled.

</line>


<line>
Like, the minimum amo<name type="ORG">un</name>t of strangled.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's fine now.

It's like it didn't even happen.

</line>


<line>
-Except...

-Except what?

</line>


<line>
Some crew members might have taken

some video of the incident

that could leak to the press

at any moment.

</line>


<line>
But that's it!

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm pulling the plug.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] What?

-No!

</line>


<line>
It's too dangerous!

We gotta cut our losses.

</line>


<line>
Cut your losses?

<ital><name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name></ital> is a monster hit!

</line>


<line>
We put your site on the map, boy-o,

so don't get squeamish now

about <name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>k cost.

</line>


<line>
Face it: <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need us

like a fish needs a bicycle

in <name type="GPE">Portland</name>, <name type="GPE">Austin</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ulder,

or <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>, Saint Paul!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are out of order.

</line>


<line>
Fine. Switch <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ulder and <name type="GPE">Austin</name>

and move the <name type="PERSON">T</name>win Cities to the front.

</line>


<line>
Now, can you give me a chance

to get everything <name type="ORG">un</name>der control?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> slams door] <ital>Yes! Yes! Yes!</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd sighs] <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have one more chance.

</line>


<line>
Do you promise me

you can take care of this?

</line>


<line>
I'm clearing my docket.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is my only priority.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d,

because my boss has made it very clear

that if we let him down, he will, quote,

"eat my ass for dinner."

-Hello?

</line>

Hey, buddy, well, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w ya feeling today?

</line>


<line>
Weird.

Am I supposed to be on set right now?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just stay right there.

I'm coming over.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-Do me a favor, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe don't watch any <name type="PERSON">T</name>V,

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>.

-What up?

</line>


<line>
Draft an email to <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>.

</line>


<line>
I wanna set up an interview for--

Hold on, I'm getting another call.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want that part in the email?

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn! It's <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

</line>


<line>
Remember me? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanted my baby,

and you came down to <name type="PERSON">Ed</name>en,

then you t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught about your past a lot,

and I decided not to give you my baby?

</line>


<line>
Of course I remember you, <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

Unfort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately, this isn't a great time.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I got to thinking... I interviewed

a lot of people for adoption.

</line>


<line>
After I said

I wasn't <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> give them the baby,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey all went cold or nasty. Except you.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were still nice.

</line>


<line>
-[tires screech]

-I think that's a sign. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-How fast can you get to <name type="PERSON">Ed</name>en?

-Why?

</line>


<line>
My boyfriend left me,

my mama stole my truck,

</line>


<line>
-and I don't want this baby no more.

-Oh, fish, <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm kind of in the middle

of something now.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're in the middle of something?

</line>


<line>
I'm about as deep in contractions

as an apostrophe!

</line>


<line>
-[panting]

-I know. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is all just coming so fast.

</line>


<line>
I... Let me call you back.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but if this baby pops out

and you're not here,

</line>


<line>
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.

-[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]

</line>


<line>
I'm kidding,

I'm giving it to someone else. [gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

<name type="PERSON">-Hi</name>.

</line>


<line>
I always forget <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w tiny

and <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ckensian this place is.

</line>


<line>
It's really great <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you don't need

nice things to be happy.

</line>


<line>
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?

-[door closes]

</line>


<line>
For the last couple months,

I've had work to distract me,

</line>


<line>
but now that we're on strangle hiatus,

I can't stop thinking about that "thing"

</line>


<line>
that happened in the prepiere

of the <ital><name type="PERSON">Phil</name><name type="PERSON">bert</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-"Strangle hiatus?"

<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, stay on topic.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what "thing" I'm talking about?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he thing between us?

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
When we had sex?

</line>


<line>
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.

<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>man-y style?

</line>


<line>
Yep, I remember.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> has no idea,

and I've never felt so guilty in my life.

</line>


<line>
I hate keeping <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets from people.

</line>


<line>
It's like <name type="PERSON">Rob Schneider's</name>

surprise party all over a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u cheating on your girlfriend

is not the same

as <name type="PERSON">Rob Schneider's</name> surprise party.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right, this is much less sad

and involves more people.

</line>


<line>
-Just tell <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> the truth.

-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.

</line>


<line>
-Could you do it?

-What? No!

</line>


<line>
But you're so good at bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing people out.

I'm more of a "good news" guy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u want your ex-wife to explain the fact

that you cheated <ital>with </ital>your ex-wife

to your current girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Well, of course every idea so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds stupid

if you describe what it is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not the only one

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> feels gross about that night.

</line>


<line>
Do you have any idea <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w shitty I felt

after you left?

</line>


<line>
So I made you feel gross, and now...

</line>


<line>
No, you didn't make me anything!

I am gross.

</line>


<line>
I feel, all the time, like a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rbage fire.

</line>


<line>
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,

but a barge, floating out to sea,

with no rudder.

</line>


<line>
I am a rudderless burning

large <name type="PERSON">ga</name>rbage barge.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way

all the time,

but I don't usually,

and now, for the first time ever, I do,

and I don't know what to do

with that feeling!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d! <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld feel bad!

-Well, I do!

</line>


<line>
-Great! Me, too!

-Great!

</line>


<line>
Great!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both moaning, kissing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, what, exactly,

do you think happened last night?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I don't know. We s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t some stuff?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here was an accident on set

and <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> got injured.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, she did?

-She's fine.

</line>


<line>
-But some footage has gotten out.

-Footage?

</line>


<line>
And because of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w it looks,

some people might get the impression

that you were trying to hurt <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> get the impression.

-Right.

</line>


<line>
-But I wasn't.

-Of course not.

</line>


<line>
What did happen?

</line>


<line>
So, the two of you are <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do

a sit-down interview with <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[chuckles]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> She makes news f<name type="ORG">un</name>!

</line>


<line>
Yes. All you need to say is that

you know the footage looks bad,

</line>


<line>
but you and <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> are actors.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u performed a convincing scene,

and you can't wait

for everyone to see the new season.

</line>


<line>
Well, it seems like you've got everything

<name type="ORG">un</name>der control.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I'm sorry things got so messy

with the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
I didn't always look out for you

as much as I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld have.

</line>


<line>
I can take care of myself.

I know you've got a lot on your plate.

</line>


<line>
It's just been so crazy,

this adoption process,

but I think once I get a baby,

my life will be less hectic, you know?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is why new mothers always

seem so <name type="PERSON">chill</name>ed-out and well-rested.

</line>


<line>
Okay, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you save your f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny jokes

for the interview?

</line>


<line>
But please don't make jokes

at the interview.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both sigh]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Sorry I broke every piece

of furniture you own.

</line>


<line>
-Will 20 dollars cover it?

-Don't worry about it. But, yes.

</line>


<line>
-So, what happens now?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-I have to tell <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-And we're getting back together.

-Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
-But she's a great girl.

-No, no.

</line>


<line>
But she is a great girl.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just don't know her.

</line>


<line>
No, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to get back together

with you.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I think you mi<name type="PERSON">s<name type="ORG">un</name></name>derstood.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen why do you keep doing this?

-Why do you keep doing this?

</line>


<line>
-Because I love you!

-Don't say that.

</line>


<line>
It's true. I never stopped loving you.

</line>


<line>
No. We can't do this ever a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
See? I told you you were great

at giving bad news.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is not what I wanted to hear.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"

</line>

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u go, "Well..." and you roll me

through the ri<name type="PERSON">ga</name>marole.

</line>

-Don't forget to plug your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

so illuminating. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you so much."

we'll be out of here before <ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>raffic.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Am I crazy

or was she kind of hitting on me?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u guys have a real flirty energy,

like <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>tt Lauer and t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se ma<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zine

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w me this video.

</line>


<line>
No, I really don't think

that's necessary.

</line>


<line>
I'll look like an idiot

if I don't know what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?

</line>


<line>
Cut to: <name type="PERSON">"Ooh</name>, it's really bad!"

But, no, seriously, can I see it?

<line>
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...

</line>


<line>
Well, this looks like...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm actually...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane! What have you been up to?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell me everything.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I've been working

on a book of essays--

</line>


<line>
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,

and it's very rude of you

to assume that I care.

</line>


<line>
I have news that's actually interesting.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Girl Croosh</name> is pivoting to video,

and I want you to be <ital>the face.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he face?

-Of the site.

</line>


<line>
Every woman <name type="ORG">un</name>der 40 will t<name type="ORG">un</name>e in

to hear what you have to say.

</line>


<line>
And possibly women over 40,

but we have no way of knowing

because they're invisible

to our site metrics.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Stefani</name>... no.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand.

My parents never said no to me growing up,

so I'm literally incapable

of processing it as a concept.

</line>


<line>
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserable

and I make other people miserable.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what I'm doing.

I can't be a trusted news source,

or an aut<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rity,

or a role model for anybody.

</line>


<line>
Uh, no one called you a "role model."

Settle down.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Um...

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what your problem is?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u <name type="PERSON">ho</name>ld everyone

to an impossible standard,

including yourself.

</line>


<line>
It's super helpful

for writing <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t-take shakedowns,

and clickbait take-downs,

but totally toxic for your personal life

and internalized sense

of self-worth, girl.

</line>


<line>
But s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uldn't we be asking

more of ourselves

</line>


<line>
-and of the people in our lives?

-Of course. But we all fail, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he world is <name type="ORG">un</name>forgiving enough as it is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he least we could do is find ways

to forgive each other and ourselves.

</line>


<line>
Well, then maybe we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be

more forgiving in our content,

and maybe not publish so many take-downs?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

No, <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a very bad time.

We're about to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot the interview.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized

your schedule.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u could write it down.

-With what, a quill?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, <name type="PERSON">Elbridge Gerry</name>.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, this lady s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>wed up

at the office

and she was being super annoying,

so I brought her here.

</line>


<line>
-What lady? [<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you answering your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne?

Why aren't you in North <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>ina?

</line>


<line>
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.

</line>


<line>
As soon as this is settled

I will take the first plane there,

but this is just not the best time.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, if you can't do this, don't do it.

</line>


<line>
My mom worked all the time

and she never made time for me.

</line>


<line>
I felt so alone growing up,

especially because I never knew my dad

or my twin brother

because our parents broke up

when we were babies,

and wouldn't even talk to each other.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">T</name>racy, I had no idea.

</line>


<line>
My w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le life,

all I had was this half of a medallion

with part of a family crest on it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he crest of a family I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>ring.

-Ex-squeeze me?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, but your story sucks.

</line>


<line>
I mean, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> wasn't separated

from their family as a baby

and still wears their half of a medallion

in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pes of one day being re<name type="ORG">un</name>ited

with their long-lost twin?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat exact thing happened to me

and you don't see me bitching about it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">God</name></name>, get over yourself.

I didn't realize it was a co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>on thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, obviously it is,

so can you get to your point already?

</line>


<line>
I was getting to it

if you'd quit talking already.

</line>


<line>
My point is, not every woman is supposed

to be a mother.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you'd be happier

if you freed yourself

from that expectation,

and just lived the life

you'd clearly rather be living.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>wo minutes to air!

</line>


<line>
No, that's not... I'm not...

I can't even deal with this right now.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to leave.

-All right, let's go.

</line>


<line>
She's in one of her moods.

</line>


<line>
I still think it's pretty nutty

we both have the left half of a medallion.

</line>


<line>
Like, what are the odds?

</line>


<line>
Nah, it's a completely different thing

with me. Mine is the right half.

</line>


<line>
-So...

-Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[exhales]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[clears throat]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Hey.

</line>


<line>
-Hello, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

-Are you okay? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look good.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I'm so sorry.

-Let's just do the interview, okay?

</line>


<line>
-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> come clean about everything.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Everyone needs to know what I did.

</line>


<line>
-[bell rings]

-[man] Please get in positions.

</line>


<line>
No. Don't do that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, what I did to you--

I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.

</line>


<line>
I'll say it was pretty bad.

</line>


<line>
-It was assault.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u physically overpowered me,

and if there were any justice,

you would be in jail right now.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so...

</line>


<line>
But my career,

after so many failed attempts,

is finally starting to take off.

</line>


<line>
I am getting offers, and fan mail,

and ma<name type="PERSON">ga</name>zine columns

about what a good actor I am.

</line>


<line>
People know me because of my acting.

</line>


<line>
And all that goes away if I'm just

the girl w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> got c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ked

by <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man.

</line>


<line>
I can't lie about this.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be the most notable

thing that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be the question

I get asked in interviews

for the rest of my life.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I--

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to do this for me, okay?

</line>


<line>
Because I just want this to be over.

</line>


<line>
Can we talk about it,

maybe after the interview?

</line>


<line>
No. I will be civil to you on set

when we have scenes together,

but otherwise, I never wanna think

about you a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, guys, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w are we doing?

-So good, <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>.

</line>


<line>
We're so excited to be here,

aren't we, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Um, yeah.

<line>

<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> looks so angry in the video.

</line>

And <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, you look terrified.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>, we're actors. It's what we do.

</line>

-Oh, thank <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

but they were total boobs.

</line>


<line>

<line>
Are you saying I don't have the aut<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rity

to do my job?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Now entering sleep mode.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna sleep with me?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat is not a mode

I'm comfortable with, Mr. Fondle.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital>Please connect to power source!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sps]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So first, he said

I had insufficient power...

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
Which I have never heard him say

to a man.

</line>


<line>
And then he asked me to "connect"

to his "power source."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you feel physically threatened?

Was there any implication of assault?

</line>


<line>
Not assault, but he did make a mention

of "low battery".

</line>


<line>
It is never acceptable to threaten

an employee with battery at any level.

</line>


<line>
What time is it right now?

</line>


<line>
For female employees

of one popular website,

the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!

</line>


<line>
What started with the alle<name type="PERSON">ga</name>tions

of one j<name type="ORG">un</name>ior executive

has quickly snowballed

into an avalanche of accusation,

as women at every level have come forward

with their own harrowing stories

of what happens

when the big hand

meets the little hand.

</line>


<line>
He said he wanted to "...get all up

in my guts with his penis

and ejaculate inside me."

</line>


<line>
At the time, I just t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught

it was typical corporate banter,

but now I'm like, uh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, obviously,

</line>


<line>
men s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld not be en<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ging

in predatory behavior at the office,

</line>


<line>
but I'm worried now the pendulum's

<name type="PERSON">gonna</name> swing too far in the other extreme

</line>


<line>
where they'll be held acco<name type="ORG">un</name>table

for that behavior, and that's not ideal.

</line>


<line>
Uh, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> Fondle is a sex robot,

and he s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld not be a CEO

of any company.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[reporter]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> When you say "sex robot,"

you're speaking metap<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rically, right?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he board has taken decisive action

to remove <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> Fondle

</line>


<line>
by placing him

on an indefinite paid leave.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,

canceling our slate of streaming series

and refocusing on our original mission

of being a website you can go to

</line>


<line>
if you don't know what time it is,

that also doesn't harass anyone.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a great day for the women

of this company,

</line>


<line>
many of w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m will be laid off.

</line>


<line>
-[reporters clamoring]

</line>


<line>
So, you got a call from your dentist;

no cavities.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Emily</name> Van Camp wants to move

your four o'clock to five.

</line>


<line>
And also, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd wanted me to let you know

that the network folded,

everyone got fired...

[yawns] And your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w is canceled.

</line>


<line>

We're all just... guys...

and bad stuff sometimes.

<line>
And all we can do is try to do

less bad stuff and more good stuff,

but you're never going to be good.

Because you're not bad.

So, you need to stop using that

as an excuse.

</line>


<line>
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.

</line>


<line>
Because I need to talk to you

about something.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, this is really bad.

Why would you do this to me?

</line>


<line>
I didn't tell you what it is.

</line>


<line>
No one ever "needs to talk"

about something good!

</line>


<line>
No one ever says,

"I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday"

or, "I need to talk to you:

and her red carpet looks this season

are to die for!"

</line>

I was going to tell you.

</line>


<line>

as the <name type="PERSON">Felicity Jones</name> thing?

we're going to get through it together.

-Is that okay?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, you have two options.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can go back <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

and try to do things your way,

like you've been doing all your life,

or you can see what these guys

have to offer.

</line>


<line>
I don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why you're being so nice to me.

</line>


<line>
After everything you know about me,

all the shit I put you through.

</line>


<line>
When I was in high sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol,

I had this friend. <name type="PERSON">Abby</name>.

</line>


<line>
She was my only friend

and we did everything together,

<name type="ORG">un</name>til she got adopted by the cool kids

and then she turned on me...

so fast.

</line>


<line>
She used every <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret she knew about me,

every vulnerability.

</line>


<line>
She made me miserable

my entire sop<name type="PERSON">ho</name>more year.

</line>


<line>
But then that su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er

when her mom got sick, like really sick,

and all her cool friends were off

vacationing in <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rtha's <name type="PERSON">Vine</name>yard,

</line>


<line>
-I was there for her.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm an idiot. And it was <name type="PERSON">Abby</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I hated her,

and I will never forgive her,

but she needed me and...

she was my best friend and I loved her.

</line>


<line>
And now... you're here, and I hate you,

but you're my best friend,

and you need me.
