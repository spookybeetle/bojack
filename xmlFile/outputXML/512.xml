<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>]</nonVerbComm> You shut down production?

</line>


<line>
Just for a couple of days.

</line>


<line>
What is going on over there?

</line>


<line>
-It's a minor injury issue.

-A stunt went slightly awry.

</line>


<line>
Again?

</line>


<line>
And one of our stars

got a little strangled.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Just a little strangled.

</line>


<line>
Like, the minimum amount of strangled.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's fine now.

It's like it didn't even happen.

</line>


<line>
-Except...

-Except what?

</line>


<line>
Some crew members might have taken

some video of the incident

that could leak to the press

at any moment.

</line>


<line>
But that's it!

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm pulling the plug.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Flip</name>] What?

-No!

</line>


<line>
It's too dangerous!

We gotta cut our losses.

</line>


<line>
Cut your losses?

<ital>Philbert</ital> is a monster hit!

</line>


<line>
We put your site on the map, boy-o,

so don't get squeamish now

about sunk cost.

</line>


<line>
Face it: You need us

like a fish needs a bicycle

in <name type="GPE">Portland</name>, <name type="GPE">Austin</name>, <name type="GPE">Boulder</name>,

or <name type="GPE">Minneapolis</name>, Saint <name type="PERSON">Paul</name>!

</line>


<line>
You are out of order.

</line>


<line>
Fine. Switch <name type="GPE">Boulder</name> and <name type="GPE">Austin</name>

and move the Twin Cities to the front.

</line>


<line>
Now, can you give me a chance

to get everything under control?

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> slams door] <ital>Yes! Yes! Yes!</ital>

-[<name type="PERSON">Todd</name> sighs] You have one more chance.

</line>


<line>
Do you promise me

you can take care of this?

</line>


<line>
I'm clearing my docket.

This is my only priority.

</line>


<line>
Good,

because my boss has made it very clear

that if we let him down, he will, quote,

"eat my ass for dinner."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[high-pitched ringing]

-[ringtone playing]

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
Hey, buddy, well, how ya feeling today?

</line>


<line>
Weird.

Am I supposed to be on set right now?

</line>


<line>
You just stay right there.

I'm coming over.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-Do me a favor, though?

</line>


<line>
Maybe don't watch any TV,

or go on the Internet,

</line>


<line>
or take any phone calls

from anybody else until I get there, okay?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-[touch tones beeping]

</line>


<line>
-Ugh.

-[line ringing]

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>.

-What up?

</line>


<line>
Draft an email to <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>.

</line>


<line>
I wanna set up an interview for--

Hold on, I'm getting another call.

</line>


<line>
You want that part in the email?

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Princess Carolyn! It's <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

</line>


<line>
Remember me? You wanted my baby,

and you came down to <name type="LOC">Eden</name>,

then you thought about your past a lot,

and I decided not to give you my baby?

</line>


<line>
Of course I remember you, <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I got to thinking... I interviewed

a lot of people for adoption.

</line>


<line>
After I said

I wasn't gonna give them the baby,

</line>


<line>
They all went cold or nasty. Except you.

You were still nice.

</line>


<line>
-[tires screech]

-I think that's a sign. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
-How fast can you get to <name type="LOC">Eden</name>?

-Why?

</line>


<line>
My boyfriend left me,

my mama stole my truck,

</line>


<line>
-and I don't want this baby no more.

-Oh, fish, <name type="PERSON">Sadie</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'm kind of in the middle

of something now.

</line>


<line>
You're in the middle of something?

</line>


<line>
I'm about as deep in contractions

as an apostrophe!

</line>


<line>
-[panting]

-I know. This is all just coming so fast.

</line>


<line>
I... Let me call you back.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but if this baby pops out

and you're not here,

</line>


<line>
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
I'm kidding,

I'm giving it to someone else. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hi.

</line>


<line>
I always forget how tiny

and Dickensian this place is.

</line>


<line>
It's really great how you don't need

nice things to be happy.

</line>


<line>
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?

-[door closes]

</line>


<line>
For the last couple months,

I've had work to distract me,

</line>


<line>
but now that we're on strangle hiatus,

I can't stop thinking about that "thing"

</line>


<line>
that happened in the prepiere

of the <ital>Philbert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-"Strangle hiatus?"

-<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, stay on topic.

</line>


<line>
-You know what "thing" I'm talking about?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-The thing between us?

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
When we had sex?

</line>


<line>
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.

Human-y style?

</line>


<line>
Yep, I remember.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> has no idea,

and I've never felt so guilty in my life.

</line>


<line>
I hate keeping secrets from people.

</line>


<line>
It's like <name type="PERSON">Rob Schneider</name>'s

surprise party all over again.

</line>


<line>
You cheating on your girlfriend

is not the same

as <name type="PERSON">Rob Schneider</name>'s surprise party.

</line>


<line>
You're right, this is much less sad

and involves more people.

</line>


<line>
-Just tell <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name> the truth.

-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.

</line>


<line>
-Could you do it?

-What? No!

</line>


<line>
But you're so good at bumming people out.

I'm more of a "good news" guy.

</line>


<line>
You want your ex-wife to explain the fact

that you cheated <ital>with </ital>your ex-wife

to your current girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Well, of course every idea sounds stupid

if you describe what it is.

</line>


<line>
You're not the only one

who feels gross about that night.

</line>


<line>
Do you have any idea how shitty I felt

after you left?

</line>


<line>
So I made you feel gross, and now...

</line>


<line>
No, you didn't make me anything!

I am gross.

</line>


<line>
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.

</line>


<line>
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,

but a barge, floating out to sea,

with no rudder.

</line>


<line>
I am a rudderless burning

large garbage barge.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way

all the time,

but I don't usually,

and now, for the first time ever, I do,

and I don't know what to do

with that feeling!

</line>


<line>
-Good! You should feel bad!

-Well, I do!

</line>


<line>
-Great! Me, too!

-Great!

</line>


<line>
Great!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning, kissing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So, what, exactly,

do you think happened last night?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
I don't know. We shot some stuff?

</line>


<line>
There was an accident on set

and <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> got injured.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, she did?

-She's fine.

</line>


<line>
-But some footage has gotten out.

-Footage?

</line>


<line>
And because of how it looks,

some people might get the impression

that you were trying to hurt <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>.

</line>


<line>
-They're gonna get the impression.

-Right.

</line>


<line>
-But I wasn't.

-Of course not.

</line>


<line>
What did happen?

</line>


<line>
So, the two of you are gonna do

a sit-down interview with <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name> <name type="ORG">Braxby</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> She makes news fun!

</line>


<line>
Yes. All you need to say is that

you know the footage looks bad,

</line>


<line>
but you and <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> are actors.

</line>


<line>
You performed a convincing scene,

and you can't wait

for everyone to see the new season.

</line>


<line>
Well, it seems like you've got everything

under control.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry things got so messy

with the show.

</line>


<line>
I didn't always look out for you

as much as I should have.

</line>


<line>
I can take care of myself.

I know you've got a lot on your plate.

</line>


<line>
It's just been so crazy,

this adoption process,

but I think once I get a baby,

my life will be less hectic, you know?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure.

</line>


<line>
That is why new mothers always

seem so chilled-out and well-rested.

</line>


<line>
Okay, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you save your funny jokes

for the interview?

</line>


<line>
But please don't make jokes

at the interview.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both sigh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Sorry I broke every piece

of furniture you own.

</line>


<line>
-Will 20 dollars cover it?

-Don't worry about it. But, yes.

</line>


<line>
-So, what happens now?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-I have to tell <name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-And we're getting back together.

-Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
-But she's a great girl.

-No, no.

</line>


<line>
But she is a great girl.

You just don't know her.

</line>


<line>
No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to get back together

with you.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-I think you misunderstood.

</line>


<line>
-Then why do you keep doing this?

-Why do you keep doing this?

</line>


<line>
-Because I love you!

-Don't say that.

</line>


<line>
It's true. I never stopped loving you.

</line>


<line>
No. We can't do this ever again.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sorry.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
See? I told you you were great

at giving bad news.

</line>


<line>
That is not what I wanted to hear.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>. <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
This interview's gonna go down smooth,

like a 1995 <name type="ORG">Zinfandel</name>.

</line>


<line>
You ever try one of those '95 zins?

Zinfandels.

</line>


<line>
Bad year for <name type="GPE">Oklahoma</name> federal buildings.

</line>


<line>
-M'kay.

-Here's how it's gonna go down.

</line>


<line>
Red light on the camera goes bloop!

I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?"

</line>


<line>
You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"

</line>


<line>
You go, "Well..." and you roll me

through the rigamarole.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, don't--

-Don't forget to plug your show.

</line>


<line>
Then I go, "Wow. This has been

so illuminating. Thank you so much."

</line>


<line>
Red light goes boo-de-de-boop,

we'll be out of here before <ital>Traffic.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And, yes, I'm talking about

the <name type="PERSON">Stephen Soderbergh</name> movie <ital>Traffic.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's playing on FX tonight,

and I'm hoping to catch it.

</line>


<line>
Love me some <name type="PERSON">Cheadle</name>.

</line>


<line>
Am I crazy

or was she kind of hitting on me?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You guys have a real flirty energy,

like <name type="PERSON">Matt</name> Lauer and those magazine

cut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.

</line>


<line>
-This should be fun.

-Now that's the spirit!

</line>


<line>
You gotta show me this video.

</line>


<line>
No, I really don't think

that's necessary.

</line>


<line>
I'll look like an idiot

if I don't know what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?

</line>


<line>
Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!"

But, no, seriously, can I see it?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> grunting in video]

-Hey, wow, look at me go.

</line>


<line>
-[Princess Carolyn's voice] <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>!

-Oh. Oh!

</line>


<line>
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...

</line>


<line>
Well, this looks like...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm actually...

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>! What have you been up to?

Tell me everything.

</line>


<line>
Actually, I've been working

on a book of essays--

</line>


<line>
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,

and it's very rude of you

to assume that I care.

</line>


<line>
I have news that's actually interesting.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Girl Croosh</name> is pivoting to video,

and I want you to be <ital>the face.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-The face?

-Of the site.

</line>


<line>
Every woman under 40 will tune in

to hear what you have to say.

</line>


<line>
And possibly women over 40,

but we have no way of knowing

because they're invisible

to our site metrics.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Stefani</name>... no.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand.

My parents never said no to me growing up,

so I'm literally incapable

of processing it as a concept.

</line>


<line>
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserable

and I make other people miserable.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what I'm doing.

I can't be a trusted news source,

or an authority,

or a role model for anybody.

</line>


<line>
Uh, no one called you a "role model."

Settle down.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Um...

-You know what your problem is?

</line>


<line>
You hold everyone

to an impossible standard,

including yourself.

</line>


<line>
It's super helpful

for writing hot-take shakedowns,

and clickbait take-downs,

but totally toxic for your personal life

and internalized sense

of self-worth, girl.

</line>


<line>
But shouldn't we be asking

more of ourselves

</line>


<line>
-and of the people in our lives?

-Of course. But we all fail, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.

</line>


<line>
The least we could do is find ways

to forgive each other and ourselves.

</line>


<line>
Well, then maybe we should be

more forgiving in our content,

and maybe not publish so many take-downs?

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
- All right, let's bring in the talent.

-[mumbling]

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

-Hey, is this a good time to talk?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Stuart</name>. This is a very bad time.

We're about to shoot the interview.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized

your schedule.

</line>


<line>
-You could write it down.

-With what, a quill?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, <name type="PERSON">Elbridge Gerry</name>.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, this lady showed up

at the office

and she was being super annoying,

so I brought her here.

</line>


<line>
-What lady? [gasps]

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you answering your phone?

Why aren't you in North Carolina?

</line>


<line>
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.

</line>


<line>
As soon as this is settled

I will take the first plane there,

but this is just not the best time.

</line>


<line>
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.

</line>


<line>
My mom worked all the time

and she never made time for me.

</line>


<line>
I felt so alone growing up,

especially because I never knew my dad

or my twin brother

because our parents broke up

when we were babies,

and wouldn't even talk to each other.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">Tracy</name>, I had no idea.

</line>


<line>
My whole life,

all I had was this half of a medallion

with part of a family crest on it.

</line>


<line>
The crest of a family I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
-Boring.

-Ex-squeeze me?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, but your story sucks.

</line>


<line>
I mean, who wasn't separated

from their family as a baby

and still wears their half of a medallion

in the hopes of one day being reunited

with their long-lost twin?

</line>


<line>
That exact thing happened to me

and you don't see me bitching about it.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">God</name>, get over yourself.

-Get over yourself.

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize it was a common thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, obviously it is,

so can you get to your point already?

</line>


<line>
I was getting to it

if you'd quit talking already.

</line>


<line>
My point is, not every woman is supposed

to be a mother.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you'd be happier

if you freed yourself

from that expectation,

and just lived the life

you'd clearly rather be living.

</line>


<line>
Two minutes to air!

</line>


<line>
No, that's not... I'm not...

I can't even deal with this right now.

</line>


<line>
-You need to leave.

-All right, let's go.

</line>


<line>
She's in one of her moods.

</line>


<line>
I still think it's pretty nutty

we both have the left half of a medallion.

</line>


<line>
Like, what are the odds?

</line>


<line>
Nah, it's a completely different thing

with me. Mine is the right half.

</line>


<line>
-So...

-Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm> Hey.

</line>


<line>
-Hello, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

-Are you okay? You look good.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I'm so sorry.

-Let's just do the interview, okay?

</line>


<line>
-I'm gonna come clean about everything.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Everyone needs to know what I did.

</line>


<line>
-[bell rings]

-[man] Please get in positions.

</line>


<line>
No. Don't do that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, what I did to you--

I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.

</line>


<line>
I'll say it was pretty bad.

</line>


<line>
-It was assault.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
You physically overpowered me,

and if there were any justice,

you would be in jail right now.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so...

</line>


<line>
But my career,

after so many failed attempts,

is finally starting to take off.

</line>


<line>
I am getting offers, and fan mail,

and magazine columns

about what a good actor I am.

</line>


<line>
People know me because of my acting.

</line>


<line>
And all that goes away if I'm just

the girl who got choked

by <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
I can't lie about this.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be the most notable

thing that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
I don't want you to be the question

I get asked in interviews

for the rest of my life.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, I--

-You need to do this for me, okay?

</line>


<line>
Because I just want this to be over.

</line>


<line>
Can we talk about it,

maybe after the interview?

</line>


<line>
No. I will be civil to you on set

when we have scenes together,

but otherwise, I never wanna think

about you again.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, guys, how are we doing?

-So good, <name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>.

</line>


<line>
We're so excited to be here,

aren't we, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Um, yeah.

-[buzzer blares]

</line>


<line>
I'm here with <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>

and <name type="PERSON">Gina</name> <name type="PERSON">Cazador</name>,

stars of the hit show <ital>Philbert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Let's cut to the chase. That video.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>,

it's so embarrassing.

</line>


<line>
-This is all a misunderstanding.

-I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

</line>


<line>
We've actually been laughing

about it here on set!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Really?

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> looks so angry in the video.

</line>


<line>
And <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, you look terrified.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Biscuits</name>, we're actors. It's what we do.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, thank <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

-Yep, actors.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I gotta ask.

Is the story true? Are you two an item?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Busted!

</line>


<line>
Oh, boy.

Looks like you got your scoop!

</line>


<line>
Can you give us a kiss?

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Sure thing.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[kisses]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
-What's it like dating your co-star?

-It's so great.

</line>


<line>
I'll bet sometimes, though,

you wanna strangle each other, right?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you bet!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> chuckles]

-[<name type="PERSON">Gina</name> growling]

</line>


<line>
Okay, you two.

This has been illuminating.

</line>


<line>
-Thank you so much.

-[bell rings]

</line>


<line>
-[man] That's a cut!

-That was amazing.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Gina</name>]</nonVerbComm> Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You wanted to see me, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I must make love to you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> You mean to my brain,

because I have such good ideas.

</line>


<line>
Thanks for the encouragement.

I never got that at my last job.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Nice boobs.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That's exactly right.

</line>


<line>
Those guys were nice,

but they were total boobs.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm gonna go review

the third quarter budget

with our diagnostics team.

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>Insufficient power.</ital>

<ital>-</ital>To review the budget?

</line>


<line>
-[panel beeping]

-[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>] <ital>Insufficient power.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you saying I don't have the authority

to do my job?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Now entering sleep mode.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You wanna sleep with me?

</line>


<line>
That is not a mode

I'm comfortable with, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Please connect to power source!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So first, he said

I had insufficient power...

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
Which I have never heard him say

to a man.

</line>


<line>
And then he asked me to "connect"

to his "power source."

</line>


<line>
Did you feel physically threatened?

Was there any implication of assault?

</line>


<line>
Not assault, but he did make a mention

of "low battery".

</line>


<line>
It is never acceptable to threaten

an employee with battery at any level.

</line>


<line>
What time is it right now?

</line>


<line>
For female employees

of one popular website,

the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!

</line>


<line>
What started with the allegations

of one junior executive

has quickly snowballed

into an avalanche of accusation,

as women at every level have come forward

with their own harrowing stories

of what happens

when the big hand

meets the little hand.

</line>


<line>
He said he wanted to "...get all up

in my guts with his penis

and ejaculate inside me."

</line>


<line>
At the time, I just thought

it was typical corporate banter,

but now I'm like, uh...

</line>


<line>
Look, obviously,

</line>


<line>
men should not be engaging

in predatory behavior at the office,

</line>


<line>
but I'm worried now the pendulum's

gonna swing too far in the other extreme

</line>


<line>
where they'll be held accountable

for that behavior, and that's not ideal.

</line>


<line>
Uh, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name> is a sex robot,

and he should not be a CEO

of any company.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[reporter]</nonVerbComm> When you say "sex robot,"

you're speaking metaphorically, right?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
The board has taken decisive action

to remove <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>

</line>


<line>
by placing him

on an indefinite paid leave.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,

canceling our slate of streaming series

and refocusing on our original mission

of being a website you can go to

</line>


<line>
if you don't know what time it is,

that also doesn't harass anyone.

</line>


<line>
This is a great day for the women

of this company,

</line>


<line>
many of whom will be laid off.

</line>


<line>
-[reporters clamoring]

-[camera shutter clicking]

</line>


<line>
So, you got a call from your dentist;

no cavities.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Emily</name> Van Camp wants to move

your four o'clock to five.

</line>


<line>
And also, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name> wanted me to let you know

that the network folded,

everyone got fired...

[yawns] And your show is canceled.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It's over. It's all over.

</line>


<line>
What are you talking about?

It's not over.

</line>


<line>
We just have to find our baby

another home.

</line>


<line>
Maybe What <name type="ORG">Time</name> Is It Right Now is gone,

but there are like a billion

other websites, right?

</line>


<line>
What about that website you go to,

to pay your parking tickets?

</line>


<line>
Or if we're really desperate, TNT?

</line>


<line>
The point is we're just getting started,

Princess Carolyn!

</line>


<line>
-[door grinds]

-Princess Carolyn?

</line>


<line>
-[phone rings]

-She's gone.

</line>


<line>
Unless...

</line>


<line>
I was Princess Carolyn the whole time.

</line>


<line>
Mm.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[in female voice]</nonVerbComm> Oh, fish!

</line>


<line>
Well, this is it, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Fondle</name>.

The end of the line.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Hiya, hotshot.

</line>


<line>
I've been following your career

pretty closely and I like what I see.

</line>


<line>
How'd you like a corner office

at <name type="ORG">Disney</name>-Fox-AT&amp;T-AOL-

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Give it to me!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh, you know this guy just got fired

for sexual harassment, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, so he's learned his lesson

and he's ready to reenter the workforce.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I have many penises.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> You said it, buddy.

Give us a call.

</line>


<line>
Do you wanna take a ride?

There's something I wanna show you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Henry</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[knocking on door]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello.

</line>


<line>
Shouldn't you be out

"not really strangling" someone?

</line>


<line>
The last time I saw you,

you said you still believed

I could be a better person.

</line>


<line>
-Do you still believe that?

-I do.

</line>


<line>
I need you to write one

of your take-downs.

</line>


<line>
-About me.

-What?

</line>


<line>
You can't write anything

about <name type="PERSON">Gina</name>, but... the other stuff.

</line>


<line>
Everything. I need to get it out.

</line>


<line>
No. I'm done writing about you,

or for you, or with you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, please, I need this.

</line>


<line>
I'm a bad guy

and the world needs to know.

</line>


<line>
There's no such thing as "bad guys"

or "good guys."

</line>


<line>
We're all just... guys...

who do good stuff sometimes

and bad stuff sometimes.

</line>


<line>
And all we can do is try to do

less bad stuff and more good stuff,

but you're never going to be good.

Because you're not bad.

</line>


<line>
So, you need to stop using that

as an excuse.

</line>


<line>
I am asking to be held accountable.

</line>


<line>
And I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.

</line>


<line>
Whatever you put in that story,

no one is gonna "hold you accountable."

</line>


<line>
You need to take responsibility

for yourself.

</line>


<line>
I don't know how to do that!

It's all over. [pants]

Oh, man.

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Aw.

</line>


<line>
She's beautiful.

What are you gonna call her?

</line>


<line>
Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

</line>


<line>
But not really, though, right?

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you think my cactus is gonna be

okay if I'm not there for six weeks?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I think

your cactus is gonna be okay.

</line>


<line>
-Is this a mistake?

-No.

</line>


<line>
Wow, it feels so weird to be eating here.

</line>


<line>
So, this is what it's like

from the other side.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>, I took you here

because I wanted you to be somewhere

you felt comfortable.

</line>


<line>
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.

</line>


<line>
Because I need to talk to you

about something.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, this is really bad.

Why would you do this to me?

</line>


<line>
I didn't tell you what it is.

</line>


<line>
No one ever "needs to talk"

about something good!

</line>


<line>
No one ever says,

"I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday"

or, "I need to talk to you:

<name type="PERSON">Felicity Jones</name> hired a new stylist

and her red carpet looks this season

are to die for!"

</line>


<line>
Well, good news first:

<name type="PERSON">Felicity Jones</name> did hire a new stylist,

but sadly,

her fashion choices just aren't popping.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! This is bad news!

Well, thank you for telling me.

</line>


<line>
That isn't the thing

I was going to tell you.

</line>


<line>
There's more bad news?

</line>


<line>
Is it worse or not as bad

as the <name type="PERSON">Felicity Jones</name> thing?

</line>


<line>
Well, it's different...

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

we're going to get through it together.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is, I love you,

and nothing's going to change that.

</line>


<line>
Nothing you say is going to make me

stop loving you, no matter what.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Pickles</name>... I...

</line>


<line>
What is it?

</line>


<line>
-[grunts] Will you marry me?

-[squeals]

</line>


<line>
What do I say... when I go in?

</line>


<line>
You say, "Hello. I am <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Horseman</name>, obviously.

</line>


<line>
You've probably heard of me.

I'm very famous.

</line>


<line>
So... Sober me up, please!"

</line>


<line>
What if I get sober...

and I'm still the same awful person

I've always been,

only more... sober?

</line>


<line>
I think that is a very real possibility.

</line>


<line>
-Don't be shitty.

-I'm not.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Rehab</name> is not a cure-all that's gonna

suddenly make you not an asshole.

</line>


<line>
Then why are we doing this?

Let's turn around and go home.

</line>


<line>
-You wanna go home?

-Is that okay?

</line>


<line>
Look, you have two options.

</line>


<line>
You can go back home

and try to do things your way,

like you've been doing all your life,

or you can see what these guys

have to offer.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand

why you're being so nice to me.

</line>


<line>
After everything you know about me,

all the shit I put you through.

</line>


<line>
When I was in high school,

I had this friend. <name type="PERSON">Abby</name>.

</line>


<line>
She was my only friend

and we did everything together,

until she got adopted by the cool kids

and then she turned on me...

so fast.

</line>


<line>
She used every secret she knew about me,

every vulnerability.

</line>


<line>
She made me miserable

my entire sophomore year.

</line>


<line>
But then that summer

when her mom got sick, like really sick,

and all her cool friends were off

vacationing in <name type="LOC">Martha</name>'s Vineyard,

</line>


<line>
-I was there for her.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm an idiot. And it was <name type="PERSON">Abby</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I hated her,

and I will never forgive her,

but she needed me and...

she was my best friend and I loved her.

</line>


<line>
And now... you're here, and I hate you,

but you're my best friend,

and you need me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales, exhales]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You know what you're gonna say?

You wanna practice?

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna say,

"Hello. I am <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, you know who I am,

because I'm very famous,

and also we called ahead.

</line>


<line>
And I am here because... I need help."
