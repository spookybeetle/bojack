  <title>Our A-Story Is a 'D' Story - BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
- Huh?

- Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

</line>


<line>
- I don't have actual honey.

- [sighs]

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- Diane!

</line>


<line>
Hey, Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

Mwah.

</line>


<line>
BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man!

</line>


<line>
- Put her there!

- That's all right.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna get

that handshake.

</line>


<line>
No, you're not.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Since when am I Honey?

</line>


<line>
Since now.

</line>


<line>
I made up the nickname

while you were back east.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, really? You made up

calling someone honey?

</line>


<line>
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

</line>


<line>
Hey, why don't we give

BoJack a ride?

</line>


<line>
That's okay.

Todd's supposed to pick me up.

</line>


<line>
Where is he?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[indistinct chatter]</nonVerbComm>

First day, huh?

Well, stick with me.

You're gonna be just fi--

<nonVerbComm>[gasping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Probably just forgot,

the lazy bum.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'll take the ride

as long as it's not as bumpy

as that pilot's landing.

</line>


<line>
That was seriously

very scary.

</line>


<line>
- Hey...

- I'm just glad you were there,

because I really would have

freaked out by myself.

</line>


<line>
Be stiller,

my beating heart.

</line>


<line>
Stiller crazy

after all these years.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- Did I miss something f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny?

</line>


<line>
- I love f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny somethings.

- No, we were just laughing

about this Ben Stiller article

from the plane.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- Ooh, he is the best.

</line>


<line>
- What did it say?

- You wouldn't get it.

</line>


<line>
Either you read <ital>Hemisphere's</ital>

<ital>Magazine, </ital>or you don't.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I might be crazy, because

this is such a dumb question,

and I'm embarrassed

to even ask,

but do I have anything to worry

about with you and Diane?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

What?

</line>


<line>
Get out of here.

</line>


<line>
I got to say, BoJack,

that is a relief.

</line>


<line>
Ho-ho! Whoo!

<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you guys

want to grab dinner?

</line>


<line>
Or at least some road sodas,

</line>


<line>
so I don't have

to go through the ordeal

</line>


<line>
of sobering up and then having

to get dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k all over again?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I actually already made

special plans

</line>


<line>
for just the two of us.

</line>


<line>
Oh, come on.

</line>


<line>
You're the one

who's always saying

you want to hang out

with BoJack more,

and how it's weird that BoJack

never returns your calls,

and how I should

hang up the phone

because maybe BoJack's

trying to call you right now.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
I guess we can

make this work.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man.

Remember that guy in 34-B?

</line>


<line>
Do I? Can't stop

remembering him.

</line>


<line>
Uh, hey.

Diane and I have memories, too.

</line>


<line>
This place reminds me

of a cliffside meal we had

</line>


<line>
one romantic vacay to <name type="LOC">Cabo</name>.

</line>


<line>
Boring. I wasn't there.

</line>


<line>
Can we keep this

general interests?

</line>


<line>
Well, here's to a meal

we're all here for.

</line>


<line>
Mmm.

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh. Ew.

</line>


<line>
There's something

in my food.

</line>


<line>
Ah, crap.

Someone get the manager.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no. Wait.

</line>


<line>
It's supposed to be in there.

Welcome home, honey.

</line>


<line>
I got you a D pendant,

because I am D-pendant on you.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- Yeah. Real-- Real cute.

</line>


<line>
- A D for dog.

- It's for Diane.

</line>


<line>
This is the sweetest choking

hazard anyone's ever given me.

</line>


<line>
- [moans]

- Mwah.

</line>


<line>
Well, how about some champagne

for the happy couple.

</line>


<line>
Waiter, get me

a bottle of Dom

</line>


<line>
to keep with the trend

of sweet D gifts.

</line>


<line>
You're too kind,

but everyone knows you go off

menu for the good stuff.

</line>


<line>
Yes, get me your most expensive

bottle from the back.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps a 1922-ish Heidsieck

Diamant Bleu?

</line>


<line>
A toast on me

to Diane and Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

</line>


<line>
I'd like a ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d of drinks

for everyone.

</line>


<line>
Off the menu, of course.

</line>


<line>
- [all cheering]

- BoJack, folks. What a sport.

</line>


<line>
And while we're all

in giving moods,

</line>


<line>
I'd like to buy you all an <name type="ORG">Xbox</name>,

courtesy of me.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all cheering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Wow. You guys don't

have to do this.

</line>


<line>
Look, I could happily

go down this petty road

of raising and re-raising

one another.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> Please do!

</line>


<line>
But I'd instead

like to highlight the fact

that Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>'s

ripping off my toast

</line>


<line>
the same way he ripped off

my entire career.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 2]</nonVerbComm> Uh, we prefer gifts

over observations.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Well, here's something

I didn't rip off.

</line>


<line>
This brand new helicopter

I just bought.

</line>


<line>
Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride

in the chopper?

</line>


<line>
- [applause and cheering]

- Okay, guys. This has been f<name type="ORG">un</name>,

and also an offensive display

of extravagant wealth,

but maybe we should

call it a night.

</line>


<line>
What's the rush?

</line>


<line>
Because I just bought

the restaurant,

and we can stay

as long as we want.

</line>


<line>
- [all cheering]

- Hey, you. I own you now.

</line>


<line>
- Do a dance.

- [scats]

</line>


<line>
Oops.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

</line>


<line>
- It's all yours.

- Please, you first.

</line>


<line>
Apparently, we both

like to be clean.

</line>


<line>
I love being clean.

That's so coincidental.

</line>


<line>
- I'm Todd.

- Klaus.

</line>


<line>
Look, I know

you're new here,

but we have a lot in common:

being white, into cleansing.

</line>


<line>
I think you'd enjoy hanging out

with me and the gang.

</line>


<line>
When you say "the gang,"

do you mean a gang?

</line>


<line>
Check this out.

If you want to lift weights,

we got great yard

connections.

</line>


<line>
If you like toilet wine,

we spent the past 20 years

perfecting pr<name type="ORG">un</name>o.

</line>


<line>
The <name type="NORP">Aryan</name> nation is number one

for a reason.

</line>


<line>
Never thought I'd say this,

but you put a pretty good

spin on <name type="NORP">Nazi</name>s.

</line>


<line>
Hey, tell you what.

Drop by our party tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Shoot the shit with the guys,

mostly about <name type="NORP">Jew</name>s,

and make up your own mind.

</line>


<line>
Until then,

take my card.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Uh, where were you

keeping that card?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Forty-five, forty-six,

forty-seven...

</line>


<line>
Guys, can we give this thing

a rest?

</line>


<line>
Rest? Why rest?

I'm not tired.

</line>


<line>
I'm twice as not tired.

</line>


<line>
Or D, sex and candy?

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm><ital> BoJack!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Todd, where the hell

have you been?

</line>


<line>
I had to carpool home

from the airport

like a goddamn

environmentalist.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry,

but I'm in jail, dude.

</line>


<line>
Well, you called the right

person, because I need your help

and you're my

phone-a-friend.

</line>


<line>
Marie Curie won Nobel prizes

in which two sciences?

</line>


<line>
<ital>A, chemistry and physics.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- B, biology and physics--

- Oh, B! The answer's B!

</line>


<line>
- It's A!

- Damn it, Todd!

</line>


<line>
This was life or death.

</line>


<line>
Same with me.

The bail's set at 50 bucks.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'll be here wai--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Yes! I am the champion

of the games!

</line>


<line>
Did you see that, Diane?

</line>


<line>
Diane?

</line>


<line>
You win, old friend.

</line>


<line>
Now if you'll excuse me,

</line>


<line>
I'm going to take

my girlfriend to bed.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We're still out?

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Night, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Good night, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Give me a bottle of something

to help me forget my problems.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

</line>


<line>
What is this,

breakfast?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's about right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulping]</nonVerbComm>

effectively.

<ital>the famed <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name>d sign.</ital>

Weird.

</line>


<line>
Weirder.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Why the hell would I steal

a giant D?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ding-dong! It's Diane.</ital>

</line>


<line>
D-- D-- Damn!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Meanwhile,</ital>

<ital>local authorities</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>are already investigating</ital>

<ital>several suspects.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>David Duchovny,</ital>

<ital>Dick Van Dyke, DMX,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and of course Dane Cook,</ital>

<ital>who we all know is a thief.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

</line>


<line>
I can't work on the book today.

Too ill. Cough.

</line>


<line>
Are you ill,

or h<name type="ORG">un</name>g-over?

</line>


<line>
Because instead of coughing

you just said the word cough.

</line>


<line>
Plus you left me a long,

dr<name type="ORG">un</name>ken voicemail last night.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, was it bad?

</line>


<line>
It was mostly a lot

of wheezing,

as if you were

climbing something,

followed by the so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds

of dismantling metal,

and then gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ting like you were

dragging something heavy

at least a few miles.

</line>


<line>
I didn't say anything

incriminating, did I?

</line>


<line>
As incriminating

as that question? No.

</line>


<line>
Good. Well, just as

a general rule,

you probably shouldn't

be listening

to any voicemails

I leave after--

</line>


<line>
- What time do I start drinking?

- Noon?

</line>


<line>
- Yup. See you later.

- But we had an appointment.

</line>


<line>
What's that? An actor flaking

on an obligation?

</line>


<line>
- Welcome to <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name>d.

- I think you mean <name type="LOC">Hollywoo</name>.

</line>


<line>
Did you see? Someone stole the D

off the sign.

</line>


<line>
Cough, cough, cough,

cough, cough.

</line>


<line>
Cough, cough, cough,

cough, door slam.

</line>


<line>
- [phone rings]

- What is it, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
You know, I'm tied up

with all my Deans today.

</line>


<line>
Kane, Norris, Winters,

and Koontz,

all being questioned

by police.

</line>


<line>
It was me. I stole the D.

</line>


<line>
- What?

<ital>- Now be a good agent</ital>

and make this

not my problem.

</line>


<line>
How did you even--?

</line>


<line>
You know, your scandal-to-work

ratio is, like, five to one.

</line>


<line>
Look, I need to get rid

of this before Diane sees it.

</line>


<line>
Why do you

care if Dia-- Oh, fish.

</line>


<line>
Are you in love

with your biographer?

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
<ital>[laughs]</ital>

<ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Get out of here.

</line>


<line>
You stole the D for Diane.

Unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I don't know.

The D might be for David,

because apparently

when I was dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k,

</line>


<line>
I printed out a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch

of pictures of David Boreanaz.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You did that.

</line>


<line>
Look, I'll keep your little

crush busy long enough

for you to get rid

of the contraband,

but the next three weddings

I'm invited to,

you're my date, dummy.

</line>


<line>
Since when to women your age

get invited to weddings?

</line>


<line>
I have a lot

of nieces and nephews!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone beeps off]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- [claps]

- Well, you pulled it off,

you deviant.

</line>


<line>
Get it? D-viant?

</line>


<line>
- I got it.

- Tell me,

how are you gonna complete

your giant bracelet?

</line>


<line>
With the chain-link fence

from <name type="GPE">Dodger</name>'s Stadium?

</line>


<line>
No. How'd you figure out

it was me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, how did I figure it out?

Well, I just followed the clues,

used deduction, puzzle-solving,

a little bit of forensics,

and also,

what did I do?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I listened to the voicemail

you left me

saying you were stealing the D

because of Diane

so I could, and I quote,

"Suck your D."

</line>


<line>
Stop leaving voicemails!

</line>


<line>
Admit it!

You like my girlfriend.

</line>


<line>
Oh, come on. I mean,

am I attracted to her? Sure.

</line>


<line>
Do my days feel better

when I'm aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d her? Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Does she get me in ways

no woman ever has? Indubitably.

</line>


<line>
Do I fantasize about her?

Yes, but only in two positions.

</line>


<line>
Look, am I the kind of guy

who would try to steal

someone else's girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Sure, of course,

but do I like her?

</line>


<line>
The answer's no.

You have nothing to worry about.

</line>


<line>
I'll cut you a deal.

</line>


<line>
I help you get rid

of that D,

and you never talk

to Diane again.

</line>


<line>
Well, I have to talk to her,

because she's writing my book.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but just don't

pursue her romantically?

</line>


<line>
- Deal.

- Ha!

</line>


<line>
- I knew I'd get that handshake.

- I regret this already.

</line>


<line>
Spread them wide, ladies.

This is a random cavity search.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Whoa!

Buy a guy a drink first.

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- Did we just say that...

</line>


<line>
- Oh!

- ...at the same time?

</line>


<line>
Look, I saw you talking

to Klaus in the shower.

</line>


<line>
Now, the <name type="NORP">Aryan</name>s are good guys,

don't get me wrong.

</line>


<line>
But I don't know

if you're gonna get

the right attention

over there.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I'd hate to get lost

in a shop that big.

</line>


<line>
Now we can't

offer you the works,

but in the <name type="NORP">Latin</name> Kings,

you'll be a star.

</line>


<line>
We're number two,

and that means we try harder.

</line>


<line>
Am I really being courted

by two gangs?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I feel like

the belle of the ball.

</line>


<line>
So, this is the shapeless

biographer

</line>


<line>
I've heard so much about.

</line>


<line>
We've met several times.

</line>


<line>
Did you just call me here

to insult me?

</line>


<line>
What is your <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, lady?

</line>


<line>
I mean, how do you get

two grown men fighting over you

like a foul ball

at a football game?

</line>


<line>
First of all, football doesn't

have foul balls.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, sports.

</line>


<line>
Second of all,

nobody's fighting over me.

</line>


<line>
Open your eyes.

</line>


<line>
BoJack's clearly

in love with you.

</line>


<line>
Wha--?

</line>


<line>
Get out of here!

</line>


<line>
Get out of here?

Why would I get out of here?

</line>


<line>
You get out of here.

This is my office.

</line>


<line>
I get the army men are police,

but what's the mustard packet

again?

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's just

a mustard packet.

</line>


<line>
- It's left over from l<name type="ORG">un</name>ch.

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
Well, can we move it

off the table?

</line>


<line>
No. I still might

want it later.

</line>


<line>
Good call.

</line>


<line>
So how do we get

the D from here

all the way up to here?

</line>


<line>
What, with all these cops

and mustards,

</line>


<line>
- it's gonna be a pickle.

- Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
The pickle's a <name type="ORG">SWAT</name> van,

but I see your point.

</line>


<line>
Might be easier to just ditch

the evidence. But how?

</line>


<line>
I-- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
You think these coffees

would get the juices flowing.

</line>


<line>
Well, they do have Bailey's

in them.

</line>


<line>
Is that why I feel dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k?

</line>


<line>
Because I've had, like,

seven or eight coffees.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I admit,

it's been bad for ideas,

but it's been great

for camaraderie.

</line>


<line>
Couldn't agree more.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, hey.

What time is it?

</line>


<line>
I probably need

to move my helicopter.

</line>


<line>
It's in a two-hour zone.

</line>


<line>
You beautiful bastard,

that's it!

</line>


<line>
We can pick up the D with your

chopper, fly it out of here,

and then dump it

out into the ocean.

</line>


<line>
Stupendous!

</line>


<line>
Take that, the ocean.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone vibrates and rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- What now, Todd?

<ital>- Listen.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, kind of landed myself in a

two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

</line>


<line>
The dates being prison gangs

and the prom being a jump-in,

so do you remember how you got

out of the same jam

on <ital><name type="ORG">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ah, a classic con<name type="ORG">un</name>drum.

</line>


<line>
Well, I recall one time

on <ital>Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>'s <name type="ORG">House</name>--</ital>

</line>


<line>
I think he's talking to me,

pal.

You know, the guy

whose show

invented the

two-dates-to-the-prom story.

</line>


<line>
You may have invented it, but

I think our show perfected it.

</line>


<line>
The only thing

you ever perfected

</line>


<line>
- was stealing my th<name type="ORG">un</name>der.

- Stealing your th<name type="ORG">un</name>der, eh?

</line>


<line>
Now you're even stealing

the words I'm saying.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You know, it's tough.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I agree with the <name type="NORP">Latin</name> Kings

on social issues,

but fiscally

I'm more of an <name type="NORP">Aryan</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, juggling both

never ends well.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>,

anything to contribute?

</line>


<line>
He's just staring blankly now.

</line>


<line>
Stealing your th<name type="ORG">un</name>der.

</line>


<line>
You could also just

bail me out of here, as I said.

</line>


<line>
<ital>- It's only 50 bucks--</ital>

- Got to go, pal.

</line>


<line>
Hope it's a magical night.

</line>


<line>
All right,

you ready for the plan?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
But we are gonna need

a big distraction

to keep the eyes

off the skies.

</line>


<line>
You leave that to me.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, wait.

You had a lot to drink.

</line>


<line>
You better have

a cup of coffee.

</line>


<line>
Who loves you, people?

</line>


<line>
Look this way,

news media.

</line>


<line>
A celebrity is throwing away

his hard-earned cash.

</line>


<line>
Everyone pay attention to me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's only

one-dollar bills, folks.

</line>


<line>
Don't bother.

</line>


<line>
No, it's still free,

spendable money.

</line>


<line>
This is a huge story.

</line>


<line>
Dollars are like

the new penny.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Cash is for poor people.

</line>


<line>
What is wrong

with you bozos?

</line>

Just riot over

the damn money already.

What? This old thing?

</line>


<line>
The guards made me wear it.

</line>

Yeah, well,

it suits you.

You're an autumn, bro.

<nonVerbComm>[both gulping]</nonVerbComm>

It's good, right?

Oh.

Come meet my boy,

</line>

Uh, you know,

I'll-- I'll be right back.

I-- I left my cot <name type="ORG">un</name>made.

</line>


<line>

- Ooh, watch it.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sorry I'm late.

</line>


<line>
Hope you didn't think I was

pulling an Anne Frank on you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Good one.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe it?

</line>


<line>
I was double-crossed

by the one man

</line>


<line>
I assumed was too stupid

to even single-cross.

</line>


<line>
What? I have no idea

what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
I do have a life outside of you,

you know.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> took my D

and gave it to Diane.

</line>


<line>
Once again, he completely

ripped me off.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

That whole thing.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

Just a minute, <name type="ORG">Cate</name>.

</line>


<line>
Look, you may have come up

with a log line,

but he's the one

who sold the pitch.

</line>


<line>
This is more on brand for him

than it is for you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>- What do you mean?</ital>

- De<name type="ORG">sec</name>rated a major landmark

in a dr<name type="ORG">un</name>ken stupor,

that's a BoJack <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man thing.

</line>


<line>
But stealing it

for your girlfriend

as a grand display

of affection?

</line>


<line>
That's Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>.

</line>


<line>
You're right.

It's Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> all over.

</line>


<line>
It's the kind of bold,

romantic gesture

they base movies on.

</line>


<line>
Actually,

that's not a bad idea.

</line>


<line>
Lora? Check if anyone's

bought the rights yet.

</line>


<line>
Can we keep this about me,

please?

</line>


<line>
Even if he stole

your stealing of the D,

what he made his was telling

Diane how he felt

from his heart.

</line>


<line>
You could never

say it to me,

and you still

can't say it to her.

</line>


<line>
That's not true.

I can express feelings.

</line>


<line>
Nothing on the outside.

Nothing on the inside.

</line>


<line>
Look, I got to bo<name type="ORG">un</name>ce.

Quick question, though.

</line>


<line>
Would you see <name type="ORG">Cate</name> Blanchett

in a movie about Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name>?

</line>


<line>
Why are you wasting my time

with this?

</line>


<line>
- Of course I would. Who wouldn't?

- Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[disco music plays]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And that's why Eva Bra<name type="ORG">un</name>

was like the fifth Beatle

of <name type="ORG">the Third Reich</name>.

</line>


<line>
Wow. I never knew neo-<name type="NORP">Nazi</name>s

were so interested in <name type="NORP">Nazi</name>s.

</line>


<line>
You got some great moves,

Todd.

</line>


<line>

and I love it.

</line>


<line>
Hey, no disrespect,

but I got a few chess pieces

I forgot need whittling.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

Oh, excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank God

you're back.

</line>


<line>
I was getting nervous that

you left me for another gang.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
If that happened,

I'd have to kill you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[bleats]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you

for rescheduling

given your recent, uh,

everything.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. That was really

something.

</line>


<line>
I guess he makes

your heart stand Stiller?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but for some reason

the jury's Stiller out

on how I feel about it.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's because

it wasn't for you.

</line>


<line>
That wasn't a Diane thing.

It was a Mr. <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name> thing.

</line>


<line>
Well, what would be

a Diane thing?

</line>


<line>
A Diane thing would be

something that shows

he really knows you,

like giving you an iPod loaded

with all your favorite podcasts,

or a practical houseplant,

or surprising you

with a bo<name type="ORG">un</name>d album

of photos and emails

he saved.

</line>


<line>
That's-- That's what the Diane

I know would want.

</line>


<line>
What are you saying to me?

</line>


<line>
Just that you should be

with someone

who knows you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? Like who?

</line>


<line>
- I--

- [device beeps]

</line>


<line>
Whoa, were we--

Were we taping?

</line>


<line>
Um, okay.

</line>


<line>
Uh, you want to hear

my Andy Dick story?

</line>


<line>
It's a doozie.

</line>


<line>
All we ask for is 10%

of anything pilfered.

</line>


<line>
Drugs, cigarettes.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's the standard

gang rate.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got to go, uh,

do a prison thing.

</line>


<line>
That so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds legitimate.

We are in prison, after all.

</line>


<line>
Whew. Hey.

</line>


<line>
White people, right?

</line>


<line>
Todd? Why in the name

of Pat Buchanan

are you dressed

like a <name type="NORP">Latin</name> King?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what--

- What the hell, bro?

</line>


<line>
- Are you playing both sides?

- Look, guys,

</line>


<line>
I didn't want to choose between

you because I like you both.

</line>


<line>
Look, in fact, if you just

took the time

to get to know each other

the way you did me,

</line>


<line>
I think you'd agree

we don't need gangs anymore

because, deep down,

we're all just people.

Look, uh, things got

a bit weird earlier,

so I-- I want to make sure

that we're still on for tomorrow

to talk about the time

I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

</line>


<line>
I'm really sorry

about before.

</line>


<line>
I know the D was overkill,

so I got you something

more personal.

</line>


<line>
Aww.

</line>


<line>
I also wanted to just, um,

let you know

how much I appreciate you

working on this book with me.

</line>


<line>
I know I sometimes

get carried away,

but it's because

I love you so much.

</line>


<line>
You're a catch, Diane,

and I think you know

how much I love catch.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry if I've been

difficult in any way

during this process.

</line>


<line>
You know, it's-- It's really hard

to have somebody,

</line>


<line>
I don't know, know you,

I guess.

</line>


<line>
And you do, uh,

know me, Diane.

</line>


<line>
We're very different,

but I think we bring out

the best in each other.

</line>


<line>
It's like you're chocolate

and I'm--

</line>


<line>
- <name type="ORG">Peanutbutter</name>?

- [laughs] What? Now see?

</line>


<line>
That was so much better

than what I was gonna say.

</line>


<line>
- I was gonna say carrots.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
And I know I'm not

the perfect guy.

</line>


<line>
I actually kind of hate myself

a lot of the time.

</line>


<line>
But when-- When I'm with you,

I, uh, don't hate myself.

</line>


<line>
I like being aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d you,

and I don't know

if I ever told you that

in so many words,

so I'm telling you.

</line>


<line>
Diane, I've got an important

question to ask.

</line>


<line>
No cameras,

no big spectacle.

</line>


<line>
Just me and you.

</line>


<line>
Call me back.

by the way.
