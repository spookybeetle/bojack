<line>
Let me be the first to tell you:

I'm bad news.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're actually not the first

to tell me that.

</line>


<line>
I can't offer you parental guidance

or advice or love or support

or prolonged conversation

or interest in you,

</line>


<line>
-or remembering your name.

-It's <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck.

</line>


<line>
-And I'm not looking for another dad.

-Great.

</line>


<line>
But I've always wanted to know

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> my mother is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur mother? What do I look like,

<name type="PERSON">Josh Radnor</name>?

</line>


<line>
Nothing? Nothing for <name type="PERSON">Josh Radnor</name>.

How quickly we forget.

</line>


<line>
Just tell me the name of the woman

you had sex with in December 1999.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's all the relationship

we need to have.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was quite a time

for our nation, sex-wise...

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ Oh, 1999 ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Actually, I don't need a w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le long story.

Just get to the point.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he point is I banged a lot of women.

</line>


<line>
One-night stands, two-night stands,

<name type="ORG">nooners</name>, spooners, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t-air ballooners.

</line>


<line>
So, out of all of these women

it so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds like you really respected,

is there any chance

one of them got pregnant

and then put the baby up for adoption?

</line>


<line>
I guess <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy was kind of

a poking <name type="PERSON">ho</name>les in the condom type.

</line>


<line>
Real nutter. <name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d lay, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh.

</line>


<line>
Glad to hear my mother

was a "nutter" and "a good lay."

</line>


<line>
Can I meet her? Where is she?

</line>


<line>
I bet she's still in that same apartment

in the <name type="LOC">Valley</name>. What a dump!

</line>


<line>
Can you take me there?

</line>


<line>
Help me find my mom

and I'll leave you alone forever.

</line>


<line>
Deal. But can we go in the morning?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[yawning]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> It's getting pretty late,

I become a real ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le

if I don't get a solid seven <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs

of bed drinking a night.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld get going.

</line>


<line>
My <name type="PERSON">ho</name>stel's all the way downtown

in a pretty bad area.

</line>


<line>
Wait.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake this.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Here I go, <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe there are

no murderers out.

</line>


<line>
Yes, everyone <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pes that all the time.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, just do me a favor.

-Ugh! What now?

</line>


<line>
If I do get murdered,

will you call my eight dads

and tell them I love them?

</line>


<line>
I gotta call all eight? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hey can't

work out a p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne tree? [groans]

</line>


<line>
If you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a baby,

stay here for the night.

</line>


<line>
-All right!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>ake the couch and be quiet.

</line>


<line>
Don't get on your p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne and text

all your friends <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w sweet my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use is.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>urn off all the lights when you're

going to sleep, all of the lights.

-Wait, I'm not really--

-What if we try...

</line>


<line>
Wait, I'm almost... Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's going to happen.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> I'm sorry,

it's just difficult with all the--

-Right.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>he campaign.

-Exactly.

</line>


<line>
But it's just another two months, right?

</line>


<line>
After the election

everything goes back to normal.

</line>


<line>
-Well, <name type="ORG">un</name>less I win.

-Right.

</line>


<line>
I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.

</line>


<line>
I always knew I was probably

good at something,

but I never knew what it was.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks to <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>, I've finally realized

I'm good at people liking me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's great, and you know

I'm so happy for you,

</line>


<line>
but do you have to be

the pro-fracking candidate?

</line>


<line>
-[shudders]

<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, this is the campaign.

</line>


<line>
Nothing anyone says

during a campaign matters.

</line>


<line>
It's just promising a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of stuff

to get people to vote for you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen when you get an office,

you can do whatever you want.

</line>


<line>
-Democracy in action.

<name type="PERSON">-<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rk</name> my words--

the only fracking

that's going to be happening

</line>


<line>
-is in this bedroom.

-All right, guy.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> drill you deep,

and fill you with a mysterious substance

that scientists still don't quite

<name type="ORG">un</name>derstand the ramifications of.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his isn't sexy for me-- aaah!

-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d someone say "busy day"?

</line>


<line>
No one said "busy day," <name type="PERSON">Katrina</name>.

What <ital>did </ital>we say about knocking?

</line>


<line>
It wastes vital <name type="ORG">sec</name>onds

we'll never get back?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, everyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> isn't me

needs to shut up right now.

</line>


<line>
-No one else was talking.

-I actually have good news for once.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">CNN</name> released a poll today,

and for the first time ever,

</line>


<line>
-Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter is up.

-Damn!

</line>


<line>
Wow! Am I <name type="PERSON">John</name> <name type="PERSON">David</name>son,

<name type="PERSON">Cathy <name type="PERSON">Lee</name> Crosby</name>

and <name type="PERSON">Fran <name type="PERSON">T</name>arkenton</name> right now,

because that's--

</line>


<line>
We don't have time for the reference

you're setting up.

</line>


<line>
We're doing a presser in 30.

Go downstairs, get some breakfast.

</line>


<line>
Yeah! Breakfast!

</line>


<line>
Am I <name type="PERSON">Emilio Estevez</name>, <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>lly Ringwald,

-Just get breakfast!

-All right!

</line>


<line>
-[<name type="PERSON">ho</name>rn blaring]

-Don't you forget about me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane</name>, you look sad.

-We were kind of in the middle of--

</line>


<line>
No, I'm saying you <ital>look </ital>sad.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you need to put on fo<name type="ORG">un</name>dation,

What the...? <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>h?

</line>


<line>
-[electricity crackling]

-Aaah! Aaah!

</line>


<line>
What's going on down here?

</line>


<line>
I was trying to make you breakfast

to thank you for letting me stay here!

</line>


<line>
I put a Pop-<name type="PERSON">T</name>art in the microwave!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you take the foil off?

-No! I was doing it popcorn style!

</line>


<line>
It's all right, it's not your fault.

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>king food is impossible.

</line>


<line>
Let's get out of here

and take you to your mom's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld we do something about the fire?

</line>


<line>
Just leave it.

It'll tire itself out eventually.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[m<name type="ORG">un</name>ching]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> is this lady?

</line>


<line>
It's actually a cute story.

She was the president of my fan club.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u had sex with the president

of your fan club?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. <name type="PERSON">"Oh</name>, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, what a monster!"

</line>


<line>
I slept with someone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> loved me

more than anybody else

and dedicated her life to knowing things

about me and caring about me.

</line>


<line>
How could I be so shallow?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right, I'm sorry.

Finish your cute story.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le story.

</line>


<line>
She was the president of my fan club,

I had sex with her.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I didn't think about her

for 18 years, and here we are.

</line>

Like an omelet bar

at a mongoose convention,

you are r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning dangerously low on eggs.

</line>


<line>
How many do I have left?

</line>


<line>
Well, let's just say

it's more than <name type="PERSON">Harry Potter</name> movies,

but fewer than James <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>nd movies.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Doc</name>tor, no!

-What do you reco<name type="PERSON">mm</name>end?

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. Have you considered

impregnating a yo<name type="ORG">un</name>ger woman?

</line>


<line>
No, I want to do it with this woman.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u could try throwing money

at the problem.

<ital>Let's put a baby in you.</ital>

</line>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy, hey.

</line>


<line>
-I knew it. I knew you'd come back.

-Right. Um...

here's a very specific question:

after we had sex,

did you by any chance get pregnant

and put a baby up for adoption?

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-Wait, really?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you're my mother.

Can I hug you?

</line>


<line>
-I'm hugging my mother.

<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, I'm sorry,

I really wanted to tell you.

</line>


<line>
But when I called the number

that you <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve me,

it was for a sandwich s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>p in <name type="PERSON">T</name>emecula.

</line>


<line>
Wha...? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's so weird.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u must have dialed it wrong.

</line>


<line>
And then I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught, well, you know,

sooner or later you'd call me.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, I was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name>,

but then, you know, 9/11 happened...

</line>


<line>
-Can you ever forgive me?

-I think so.

</line>


<line>
Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?

Please come in.

</line>


<line>
And that was just such

a tough time for our co<name type="ORG">un</name>try...

</line>


<line>
So, once we introduced vicious knife-play

into our routine,

it really <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve our sex life the edge.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ve it, <name type="PERSON">croosh</name>ed it.

</line>


<line>
So the article is just about

a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?

</line>


<line>
We already have <name type="PERSON">Raquel</name>'s piece

about 69 days of sixty-nining.

</line>


<line>
-Uh-huh!

<name type="PERSON">-So <name type="PERSON">croosh</name></name>.

</line>


<line>
What about our readers

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> <ital>aren't</ital> having sex with their husbands?

</line>


<line>
Isn't this just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> make them feel bad?

</line>


<line>
Not everyone gets to have

great sex all the time, right?

</line>


<line>
Ladies?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane? Can I talk to you

in your office for a minute?

</line>


<line>
I don't have an office.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u said offices have corners

and corners are the patriarchy.

</line>


<line>
Fine. Can I talk to you in the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t-take,

cool-down yo<name type="PERSON">ga</name> area?

<line>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u seem tense.

<line>
Have you been eating gluten

and also not having sex with your husband?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, <name type="PERSON">Stefani</name>, that's not--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, relax! <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not a conversation

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a conversation

between a friend and her superior.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he campaign

has been testing our marriage.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, it's great to see

Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter so excited,

and I am supporting that.

</line>


<line>
But if I'm being <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nest,

</line>


<line>
I can't wait for it to be over

so things can go back to normal.

</line>


<line>
-H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>. And what happens if he wins?

-He's not going to win.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you see the new <name type="ORG">CNN</name> poll this morning?

</line>


<line>
He could win. People do love fracking.

</line>


<line>
It's f<name type="ORG">un</name> to say! "Frack! Frack!

<name type="PERSON">Fricky-fricky</name>-frack" [laughs]

</line>


<line>
People wouldn't love saying it

if they <name type="ORG">un</name>derstood what it actually was.

</line>


<line>
-So tell them.

-I can't go a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst my husband.

</line>


<line>
What the frack? Why not?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta do you, girl.

</line>


<line>
I always say, you gotta do you.

</line>


<line>
And if he's doing him,

then w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s doing you?

</line>


<line>
Because right now,

it seems like no one's doing you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
...and then when I was eight,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lizzie D<name type="ORG">un</name>bar's</name> mom rented us all

<ital>Freaky Friday</ital> for a sleepover,

and I got really sad because I realized

I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.

</line>


<line>
Am I talking a lot?

I feel I'm talking a lot.

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-Oh! I need to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you something.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

but I was so head over heels

in love with your father

that after we made sweet love,

and he didn't call me a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

</line>


<line>
I just got so jealous, so I made a list

of every girl he was with...

and I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d their <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me addresses...

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-...and drew <name type="PERSON">Xs</name> over their eyes.

</line>


<line>
I'm loving this conversation

but I have to go the bathroom now,

for non-me being weirded out

by this conversation-related reasons.

</line>


<line>
I just keep thinking about

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w different things would have been

if you'd have just called me.

</line>


<line>
We could have had a family together

for 18 loving years.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat might have--

-[<name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck] <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[groans]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Kids. What?

</line>


<line>
Can you join me

in the bathroom for a minute?

</line>


<line>
What?! No!

</line>


<line>
-Do you want me, sweetheart?

-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.

</line>


<line>
Uh... <name type="PERSON">Holly</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>ck?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat woman is not my mother.

She's lying to us!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy? No way!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is from the premiere

of <ital>Autumn in <name type="GPE">New <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>rk</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat movie came out in August of 2000.

I was born in September.

</line>


<line>
Does this woman look

eight months pregnant to you?

</line>


<line>
Why would they release a romantic drama

called <ital>Autumn in <name type="GPE">New <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>rk</name></ital>

in the middle of su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er?

</line>


<line>
Richard <name type="PERSON">Gere</name>

had just done <ital>R<name type="ORG">un</name>away Bride,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Winona Ryder</name> was <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t off

<ital>Girl, Interrupted</ital>

</line>


<line>
-so the studio got cocky.

-How do you know all this?

</line>


<line>
I looked it up on the Internet

because I saw this picture

and got confused why <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy

would wear a su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er dress

to a movie called

<ital>Autumn in <name type="GPE">New <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>rk</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is a su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er dress?

I guess I don't know dresses.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, focus! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not my mom!

</line>


<line>
So the lesson here is

I was right to never call her.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, so w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>--

-[<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy] Are you okay in there?

</line>


<line>
-Don't come in!

-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he scrapbook! She has that list

of all the other women you slept with.

</line>


<line>
If we get the book, we can find my mom.

</line>


<line>
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,

then you sneak in and grab the book.

Suddenly, I was awash in dreams

I received a check in the mail

for $200 with the memo line,

<line>
So you put me up for adoption?

Every name on that list was a dead end.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
Yeah. But what if I told you

there's a name that isn't on that list?

</line>


<line>
Someone <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>rcy never knew about.

</line>


<line>
What? Where is she now?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. But you can stay with me

while we try to find her?

</line>


<line>
Okay. Yeah. What's her name?

</line>


<line>
Her name was <name type="PERSON">Brown</name> Car... la.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Carl</name>a <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benz... <name type="PERSON">Brown</name>.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">Carl</name>a <name type="ORG">Mercedes</name> Benzbrown"?

Weird name.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u've got a weird name.

-I guess you're right.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe that's the first thing

we'll talk about when I meet her.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,

but you didn't give me much c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ice.

</line>


<line>
I know these last few days

have been crazy.

</line>


<line>
-But this is the hard part.

-I need you to drop out of the race.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Please, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his isn't worth it.

</line>


<line>
I hear what you're saying

and I will try to be more conscientious

of your needs.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Drop</name> out of the race.

-Because your needs are important.

</line>


<line>
I've written another piece

for <name type="PERSON">Girl Croosh</name>.

</line>


<line>
It's called

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>he Case A<name type="PERSON">ga</name>inst Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter."

</line>


<line>
When I hit this button,

the post goes live.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, don't.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to.

And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name>, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can't do that.

</line>


<line>
Because you're the only one allowed

to make decisions for this family?

</line>


<line>
No. Because it's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> come off

as a weird lovers' spat

and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

</line>


<line>
-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.

-Oh, come on.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u told me you weren't going to frack,

and now I can't

turn on a faucet in my own <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me

wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut getting third-degree burns.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get it. So like always,

you're mad at someone,

so your solution is to air

your dirty la<name type="ORG">un</name>dry for everyone to see.

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is not about <ital>us.</ital>

I don't want <ital>you </ital>to be governor

because you would be bad at it,

because you don't stand for anything.
