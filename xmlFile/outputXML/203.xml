<line>
I'm sorry

I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[audience]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Aww.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's all right. I've learned

that when you're in a loving family

there's nothing wrong

with a little <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rsin' aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughter, applause]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Cut!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w, folks.

</line>


<line>
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Brad</name>ley.

</line>


<line>
Little <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
And our star, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks for coming out.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you very much.

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

<name type="PERSON">-Wow</name>!

</line>


<line>
Great pilot.

</line>


<line>
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard

with that "<name type="PERSON">ga</name>g me with a spoon" joke.

</line>


<line>
And then we topped it

with the "get a room" joke.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his was so f<name type="ORG">un</name>.

</line>


<line>
Do we get to make more?

</line>


<line>
I think we got a real s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t.

</line>


<line>
And as long as the ratings don't dip

below a dismal 15 million a night,

we could be on the air for many years.

</line>


<line>
-No way!

-All right!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur <name type="ORG">Squirt</name>, sir.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
And if that happens,

take care of each other.

</line>


<line>
No matter what,

we're going to stick together.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you, <name type="PERSON">T</name>ina,

for t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se touching gr<name type="ORG">un</name>ts and growls.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u probably remember me

from my 2002 guest role

</line>


<line>
on <ital>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>o!

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you.

</line>


<line>
But perhaps the greatest role

I've ever played is friend.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> was a dear friend

and I am <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nored to be dedicating

this bench in his memory.

</line>


<line>
In his last days, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s cancer

had gone into remission.

</line>


<line>
He was full of <name type="PERSON">ho</name>pe.

</line>


<line>
But on the drive <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me from the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>spital,

his brakes <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve out,

he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

</line>


<line>
He survived the crash,

but he was allergic to peanuts.

</line>


<line>
He died instantly.

</line>


<line>
Let us now read his final tweets.

</line>


<line>
"I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> live forever!

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'invincible.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I think I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> hit that truck.

</line>


<line>
Hashtag '<name type="PERSON">ho</name>pefully it isn't full

of peanuts.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

</line>


<line>
I was wondering

where you wandered off to.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit. Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
I'm no good with f<name type="ORG">un</name>erals.

</line>


<line>
When I cry, it messes up my makeup

and then I get really bu<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ed out.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, same for me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> told me you came

by the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use last su<name type="PERSON">mm</name>er.

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d he tell you anything else?

</line>


<line>
No, we talked about cancer,

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w hard it is living with cancer,

about the L.A. Kings,

and then back to cancer.

</line>


<line>
-Probably--

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen I read that chapter in your book

about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w he never for<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve you

and he tried to kick you out of the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use

</line>


<line>
and you ended up wrestling on the floor

over a telescope.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you did read that part?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I just wish

there was something I could do.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna go grab a cup of vodka?

I-- I'm sorry, the f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

</line>


<line>
No. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld stick aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe you'll find

that something you're looking for.

</line>


<line>
But if you're ever in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

drop me a line.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
I t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught you lived in <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ine.

</line>


<line>
I always pictured you there.

</line>


<line>
A little <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use by a lake?

</line>


<line>
I was just there for, like, a month,

30 years ago.

</line>


<line>
-I live outside <name type="GPE">Santa Fe</name> now.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] <name type="PERSON">T</name>hink everyone here read my book?

-I didn't.

</line>


<line>
Of course you didn't.

</line>


<line>
Here's the CliffsNotes version:

Shut up, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd!

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go play astronaut in the tr<name type="ORG">un</name>k

of your car for the next few <name type="PERSON">ho</name>urs.

</line>


<line>
Have f<name type="ORG">un</name> being sad.

</line>


<line>
Do you know what you're supposed to do

with our date pits?

</line>


<line>
Why serve dates

and not have a place to put the pits?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

some people just have no class.

</line>


<line>
What are you doing here?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u didn't know <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
No, but I do know a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t ticket,

and this f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral's a real w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m's-w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>m.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Jake</name> and <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ggot Gyllenhaal,

that <name type="NORP">Pakistani</name> girl

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> go rub me some elbows.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's so much to hate

about what you just said.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d news. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know when someone dies,

everyone wants to buy their shit?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're lucky you have a piece

of <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,</ital>

because this is where money

starts rolling in.

</line>


<line>
I don't want that. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's blood money.

</line>


<line>
Well, what do you want me to do with it?

It's coming.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

</line>


<line>
-I can't deal with this.

-Oh, come on!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't think <name type="PERSON">Elton <name type="PERSON">John</name></name>

was raking it in when <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ana died?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>re like "Candle in the Windfall."

Cha-ching! H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <ital><name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have to live with the shitty</ital>

<ital>thing you did for the rest of your life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="NORP">British</name> accent]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Hello, love.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle,

I actually came here to be alone.

</line>


<line>
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

</line>


<line>
I just flew in across the pond

and I don't know which end is up.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his might be a stupid question,

but were you always so... <name type="NORP">British</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, let's get some light in here,

it's so dreadfully dreary.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure

you used to be <name type="GPE">America</name>n.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's better.

</line>


<line>
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.

She needs to lie down.

</line>


<line>
I'm not freaking out.

</line>


<line>
I just don't <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand

why that lady was being all judgy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u were touching her face

and telling her she was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> die next.

</line>


<line>
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

</line>


<line>
How is that my problem?

</line>


<line>
Hey, when was the last time

all four of us were in the same room?

</line>


<line>
Probably not since the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w ended.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I left <name type="GPE">California</name>

pretty much right after.

</line>


<line>
Now I got the biggest hardware store

in <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a lie. We're actually in <name type="GPE">Olympia</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I'm on the West End

playing <name type="PERSON">Juliet</name>'s... nurse.

</line>


<line>
-And <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w are your kids?

-I don't have any kids.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I just assumed

you had a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of kids,

</line>


<line>
'cause, you know, your body.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
I assumed

you weren't still a massive c<name type="ORG">un</name>t.

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Jesus</name> Christ, <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's an okay thing to say in <name type="GPE">England</name>.

</line>


<line>
S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ve it up your ass

with a spoonful of su<name type="PERSON">ga</name>r,

you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

</line>


<line>
-<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s, hey, hey, come on.

-Let go of me!

</line>


<line>
-I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> hulk out!

-<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s, can we just be civil for one day?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you're one to talk.

-What's that mean?

</line>


<line>
Were you being civil

when you had sex with my mom?

</line>


<line>
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which

one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-<name type="PERSON">T</name>his sucks. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u guys suck.

</line>


<line>
I don't even know

why I came to this party.

</line>


<line>
It's not a party, it's <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> died?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, maybe it's for the best

we don't get together that often.

</line>


<line>
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

</line>


<line>
Well, no one knows <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w to get

<name type="ORG">un</name>der your skin like family.

</line>


<line>
We're not a family, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
We probably won't even see each other

a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in, <name type="ORG">un</name>til the next f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral.

</line>


<line>
-Why are you all looking at me?

-<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are the oldest.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are a severe alco<name type="PERSON">ho</name>lic.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nestly so high right now,

I don't even know where I'm looking.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

and don't forget to suck a dick, <name type="GPE">dumbshi</name>--

</line>


<line>
Pardon me. Is one of you <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
I am. Of course. <name type="PERSON">God</name>, are you blind?

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
Well, forgive me.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>'s blind executor.

</line>


<line>
Per the instructions of his last will

and testament, I am to give you this disk.

</line>


<line>
Am I close?

</line>


<line>
Just take the disk from the guy.

</line>


<line>
It contains directions to <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s gold.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s gold?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here were no further details.

</line>


<line>
He was a peculiar client.

</line>


<line>
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

</line>


<line>
I'm just a blind man.

</line>


<line>
Still, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ught me wise

for some reason.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps it is my overly formal

manner of speech.

</line>


<line>
I bid you good day.

</line>


<line>
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

</line>


<line>
Right at shin level.

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do

with a floppy disk?

</line>


<line>
H<name type="PERSON">mm</name>...

</line>


<line>
So, what's up, kiddo?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> and my mom

are becoming, like, friends

and they're acting real weird.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oof</name>! Uh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[rattling overhead]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's somebody beneath you!

</line>


<line>
Jeez, all day with the...

</line>


<line>
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u wanna check out

this cool new <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me I got?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have solitaire? On your computer?

</line>


<line>
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

</line>


<line>
Wow!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s computer had a floppy disk drive.

</line>


<line>
I bet it's still in his old office.

Unless somebody else moved in.

</line>


<line>
Nobody wanted <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s office, remember?

</line>


<line>
Because it was <name type="ORG">un</name>der tap dancing star

<name type="PERSON">Savion Glover's</name> office. Let's go.

</line>


<line>
-What? Right now?

-Yeah. Don't you get it?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s giving us a re<name type="ORG">un</name>ion special.

</line>


<line>
Remember <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w he always wanted to do

a treasure h<name type="ORG">un</name>t episode of <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

but the network said it was too edgy?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his is that episode.

</line>


<line>
-I just don't know.

-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

</line>


<line>
Wait, so you'd rather just stay

at this f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral and be sad,

instead of going on a crazy adventure

to find our dead friend's <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret treasure?

</line>


<line>
Do you have any idea

<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w insane you so<name type="ORG">un</name>d?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get it.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u just don't wanna be here.

</line>


<line>
No, that's not it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> clearly wanted us to do this,

as a family.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> cares what he wanted?

</line>


<line>
He doesn't, because he's dead.

</line>


<line>
And we all know he hated your guts.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. He was my best friend

and he died hating me

and nothing I do is <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> change that,

but <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> left you that disk

because he wanted us to find his gold.

</line>


<line>
If we can <name type="PERSON">ho</name>nor <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s last wish,

then that's something.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what, but it's something.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. For <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

-Fine.

</line>


<line>
-S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>tg<name type="ORG">un</name>!

-Everyone knows you can't call s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>tg<name type="ORG">un</name>

</line>


<line>
-before you see the car!

-My turn! Get out of my way!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Brad</name>, hang on one <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>ur mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
I loved you in that one episode

of <ital>Law &amp; Order: SVU.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
How would you like

to narrate a documentary for--

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

but today is about <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

so let's respect that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I-- I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
I'll let you get back to your business.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Winkly</name>, such a shame, isn't it?

About our friend <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
It really burns my brisket

that some people would turn a f<name type="ORG">un</name>eral

into some kind of <name type="PERSON">schmooze</name>fest.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se other people are the worst.

</line>


<line>
I bet that woman barely knew <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, hi, I'm <name type="PERSON">Henry</name>.

</line>


<line>
I used to vol<name type="ORG">un</name>teer with <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

at Habitat For <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>manity.

</line>


<line>
Or as we like to call it,

<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>itat For Henranity. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
We spent most of the day working

on that name,

and only part of the day building,

but still, we helped some people.

</line>


<line>
-How did you know <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

-We also vol<name type="ORG">un</name>teered at a, um...

soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!

Whichever one is the good one.

</line>


<line>
What? I never knew you did that.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn, please elaborate.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, why don't you

talk about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w you knew <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I never met the guy.

I'm just here to <name type="PERSON">schmooze</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>ell us about your thing, t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ugh,

it so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds fascinating.

</line>


<line>
Everyone, <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ther ro<name type="ORG">un</name>d and listen

to Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn's story.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

Her name is <name type="PERSON">Nora</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know,

my parents got a divorce because of you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Nora</name>? I don't know.

I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

Okay, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd, you can do this.

Five <name type="ORG">Squirt</name>s.

What are the writers doing to my baby?

Are they killing it?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey keep giving the best story lines

about dr<name type="ORG">un</name>k driving?

Don't worry so much.

It's my le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>cy they're crapping all over.

Hold on.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Joe</name>lle.

Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

</line>


<line>
Don't you have any friends

your own age from sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol?

</line>


<line>
No. My mom's boyfriend <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me-sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ols me.

He's a p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>tographer.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend

to support female solidarity.

</line>


<line>
-So scram!

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, be nicer to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, will you?

She didn't c<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ose this life.

</line>


<line>
Remember this word: family.

</line>


<line>
Okay? <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u two are family,

whether you like it or not,

and that's the most important thing.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u listening? What's the most important?

</line>


<line>
Family. It's family. I get it.

</line>


<line>
I've got it! <name type="PERSON">T</name>he password is...

<line>
"password."

</line>


<line>
It worked!

So in that memory,

were you <name type="NORP">British</name> or <name type="GPE">America</name>n?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he disk just has just one file on it,

it's--

It's the address of a storage locker

A storage locker? Ugh!

At long last, can you keep down the noise,

keep down the f<name type="ORG">un</name>k?

</line>


<line>
If tap dancing was <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be a cool thing,

it would have caught on by now!

And when the mayor <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve us the key

<line>
Don't say that.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are you?

</line>


<line>
Some kind of magical trash troll?

</line>


<line>
No. I'm a janitor.

</line>


<line>
But I was clearing out some

of the old stages,

and I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d this transformation chamber.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oks like a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of old j<name type="ORG">un</name>k.

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you a story.

</line>


<line>
Back in the '90s, the biggest <name type="PERSON">dweeb</name>

of them all was <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> <name type="PERSON">Urkel</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
It was so f<name type="ORG">un</name>ny <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w he never knew

whether or not he did that.

</line>


<line>
Right.

Well, nerdy <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> <name type="PERSON">Urkel</name> invented a machine

that transformed him

into the debonair <name type="PERSON">Stefan Urquelle</name>.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Janitor</name>, you're standing next

to a machine right now.

</line>


<line>
Yes. <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why I brought it up.

</line>


<line>
Now, this is just a prop.

</line>


<line>
But it represents a very powerful idea.

</line>


<line>
So if I go through that magic machine,

I'll become cool and confident?

</line>


<line>
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[inhales, exhales deeply]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
-I feel different.

-Now, son--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>odd? W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd?

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">T</name>oad. <name type="PERSON">T</name>oad Chavay.

</line>


<line>
And I gotta get my <name type="PERSON">bub</name>ble on.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>chine? <name type="ORG">Squirt</name> me. Hi-yah!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat'll do, machine.

</line>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at all this

<ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d </ital>fan correspondence

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> received in the post. Capital!

<line>

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>here's a b<name type="ORG">un</name>ch of fur in here.

</line>


<line>
It's bear fur.

</line>


<line>
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s nurse is a bear.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u think she knew about this gold?

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen to this letter.

I think it might be a clue.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>. "<name type="PERSON">Dear <name type="PERSON">Herb</name></name>,

just finished reading your novel.

</line>


<line>
It's phenomenal.

</line>


<line>
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

</line>


<line>
Sincerely, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>,

the guy from that one episode

of <ital>Law &amp; Order: SVU."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> wrote a novel?

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u look thin. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you get into <name type="ORG">CrossFit</name>?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is, it is super sli<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ing.

I am for totes jel over here.

</line>


<line>
It's rectal cancer.

</line>


<line>
Ew! Some of us are eating.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, the reason I called you

is because I need a favor.

</line>


<line>
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

</line>


<line>
I want you to sober up.

</line>


<line>
First of all, rude. Second, gross.

And third, why?

</line>


<line>
I have a very important job for you,

but if you're zonked out all the time,

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure I can trust you

with the responsibility.

</line>


<line>
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sniffing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
I said tomorrow, right?

</line>


<line>
I've been working on this novel.

I wanna be remembered for something.

</line>


<line>
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom

that got ripped away from me.

</line>


<line>
But now, with this book,

I have something good.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

</line>


<line>
-It's my <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>-terpiece.

<name type="PERSON">-W<name type="PERSON">ho</name></name>a.

</line>


<line>
I want you to make sure

it gets published after I die.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u can co<name type="ORG">un</name>t on me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>o life, huh? It'll kill you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, the gold is his manuscript.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> made me promise

to get it published after he died.

</line>


<line>
And you're just remembering this now?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he ketamine's wearing off.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you were the other kid

on <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why you've been following us

aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d all day.

</line>


<line>
So no one's read this book

except for <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>

</line>


<line>
-and now the book is missing?

-He must have been waiting for <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> to die

so he could steal the book

and publish it himself.

</line>


<line>
But then when the cancer went

into remission--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Guy</name>s, I don't think

that car crash was an accident.

</line>


<line>
I think <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> might have been murdered!

<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sping]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[huffing]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

</line>


<line>
Something about a merger?

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">T</name>oad, baby.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Coolsville</name>, daddy-o.

</line>


<line>
Oh, lookie here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>! <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's my bike!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Oop</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Di</name>d I do that?

</line>


<line>
Damn. I know I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be mad,

but that guy's just so cool.

</line>


<line>
And when the river finally stopped,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> went over

to a poor little <name type="GPE">Ottawa</name>n boy

and he said, "<name type="PERSON">Son</name>, you have water now."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know, a lot of people go their

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le lives and they never give a damn.

</line>


<line>
But <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>? He <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se beavers a dam.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat was beautiful.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u clearly had a special relationship.

</line>


<line>
We were <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> sprinkle <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

over the ocean,

but his resting place s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be

someplace meaningful, don't you think?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you take this up to <name type="GPE">Ottawa</name>

and spread his ashes there.

</line>


<line>
And make sure you take a video,

and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

</line>


<line>
So we can always remember

your great friendship.

</line>


<line>
Everybody, stop!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name> is a stone-cold killer!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[all <name type="PERSON">ga</name>sp]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
What? I'm not a killer.

</line>


<line>
Unless you mean killer of gloom,

because I bring joy everywhere I go.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you mean "killer of gloom

because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know that's not what I meant.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u murdered <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

so you could publish his book.

</line>


<line>
But we're not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> let you

steal his le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>cy, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
I was afraid this would happen.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no, he's got a g<name type="ORG">un</name>!

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
No, I have <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s book.

</line>


<line>
I didn't kill <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

but I did steal his manuscript.

</line>


<line>
-So that I could burn it.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Because it's terrible.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll see for myself.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>he air in 1830s <name type="GPE">California</name> was fragrant

with the flowers of laughter

and the smoke of adventure."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Uh.

</line>


<line>
After he died, <name type="PERSON">T</name>ina and I agreed

we couldn't let the book get published.

</line>


<line>
It would have turned <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

into a laughingstock.

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>he carpenter's boy was a h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry boy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Hu</name>ngry for crumpets.

But also h<name type="ORG">un</name>gry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

</line>


<line>
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

</line>


<line>
I know there's no acco<name type="ORG">un</name>ting for taste,

but come on.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
He's right. <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> wanted a le<name type="PERSON">ga</name>cy,

but he already has one.

</line>


<line>
People loved <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d.</ital>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>his would only ruin that.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,

<name type="GPE">America</name>n <name type="PERSON">T</name>V legend <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
No need to apologize.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u ascribed a mystery to <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s death

to give it meaning.

</line>


<line>
But there is no meaning in death.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's why it's so terrifying.

</line>


<line>
