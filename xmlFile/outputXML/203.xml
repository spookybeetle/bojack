  <title>Still Broken - <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name></title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
I'm sorry

I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience]</nonVerbComm> Aww.

</line>


<line>
That's all right. I've learned

that when you're in a loving family

there's nothing wrong

with a little horsin' around.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter, applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbComm> Cut!

</line>


<line>
That's the show, folks.

</line>


<line>
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

</line>


<line>
Joelle.

</line>


<line>
Bradley.

</line>


<line>
Little <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
And our star, <name type="PERSON">BoJack Horseman</name>!

</line>


<line>
Thanks for coming out.

Thank you very much.

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

-Wow!

</line>


<line>
Great pilot.

</line>


<line>
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard

with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

</line>


<line>
And then we topped it

with the "get a room" joke.

</line>


<line>
This was so fun.

</line>


<line>
Do we get to make more?

</line>


<line>
I think we got a real shot.

</line>


<line>
And as long as the ratings don't dip

below a dismal 15 million a night,

we could be on the air for many years.

</line>


<line>
-No way!

-All right!

</line>


<line>
-Your <name type="ORG">Squirt</name>, sir.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
And if that happens,

take care of each other.

</line>


<line>
No matter what,

we're going to stick together.

</line>

<nonVerbComm>[♪♪]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[unintelligible groans continue]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Tina</name>,

for those touching grunts and growls.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
You probably remember me

from my 2002 guest role

</line>


<line>
on <ital>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Whoo!

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
But perhaps the greatest role

I've ever played is friend.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> was a dear friend

and I am honored to be dedicating

this bench in his memory.

</line>


<line>
In his last days, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s cancer

had gone into remission.

</line>


<line>
He was full of hope.

</line>


<line>
But on the drive home from the hospital,

his brakes gave out,

he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

</line>


<line>
He survived the crash,

but he was allergic to peanuts.

</line>


<line>
He died instantly.

</line>


<line>
Let us now read his final tweets.

</line>


<line>
"I'm gonna live forever!

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'invincible.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full

of peanuts.'

</line>


<line>
Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

</line>


<line>
I was wondering

where you wandered off to.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit. Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
I'm no good with funerals.

</line>


<line>
When I cry, it messes up my makeup

and then I get really bummed out.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, same for me.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> told me you came

by the house last summer.

</line>


<line>
Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Did he tell you anything else?

</line>


<line>
No, we talked about cancer,

how hard it is living with cancer,

about the L.A. Kings,

and then back to cancer.

</line>


<line>
-Probably--

-Then I read that chapter in your book

about how he never forgave you

and he tried to kick you out of the house

</line>


<line>
and you ended up wrestling on the floor

over a telescope.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you did read that part?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I just wish

there was something I could do.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

</line>


<line>
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?

I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

</line>


<line>
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

</line>


<line>
No. You should stick around.

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe you'll find

that something you're looking for.

</line>


<line>
But if you're ever in <name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>,

drop me a line.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">New Mexico</name>?

</line>


<line>
I thought you lived in <name type="GPE">Maine</name>.

</line>


<line>
I always pictured you there.

</line>


<line>
A little house by a lake?

</line>


<line>
I was just there for, like, a month,

30 years ago.

</line>


<line>
-I live outside Santa Fe now.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?

-I didn't.

</line>


<line>
Of course you didn't.

</line>


<line>
Here's the CliffsNotes version:

Shut up, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>!

</line>


<line>
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk

of your car for the next few hours.

</line>


<line>
Have fun being sad.

</line>


<line>
Do you know what you're supposed to do

with our date pits?

</line>


<line>
Why serve dates

and not have a place to put the pits?

</line>


<line>
You know,

some people just have no class.

</line>


<line>
What are you doing here?

You didn't know <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
No, but I do know a hot ticket,

and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Jake</name> and <name type="PERSON">Maggot Gyllenhaal</name>,

that <name type="NORP">Pakistani</name> girl

who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

</line>


<line>
There's so much to hate

about what you just said.

</line>


<line>
Good news. You know when someone dies,

everyone wants to buy their shit?

</line>


<line>
You're lucky you have a piece

of <ital>Horsin' Around,</ital>

because this is where money

starts rolling in.

</line>


<line>
I don't want that. That's blood money.

</line>


<line>
Well, what do you want me to do with it?

It's coming.

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

</line>


<line>
-I can't deal with this.

-Oh, come on!

</line>


<line>
You don't think <name type="PERSON">Elton <name type="PERSON">John</name></name>

was raking it in when <name type="PERSON">Diana</name> died?

</line>


<line>
More like "Candle in the Windfall."

Cha-ching! Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>]</nonVerbComm> <ital>You have to live with the shitty</ital>

<ital>thing you did for the rest of your life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="NORP">British</name> accent]</nonVerbComm> Hello, love.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Joelle,

I actually came here to be alone.

</line>


<line>
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

</line>


<line>
I just flew in across the pond

and I don't know which end is up.

</line>


<line>
This might be a stupid question,

but were you always so... <name type="NORP">British</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, let's get some light in here,

it's so dreadfully dreary.

</line>


<line>
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure

you used to be American.

</line>


<line>
That's better.

</line>


<line>
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.

She needs to lie down.

</line>


<line>
I'm not freaking out.

</line>


<line>
I just don't understand

why that lady was being all judgy.

</line>


<line>
You were touching her face

and telling her she was gonna die next.

</line>


<line>
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

</line>


<line>
How is that my problem?

</line>


<line>
Hey, when was the last time

all four of us were in the same room?

</line>


<line>
Probably not since the show ended.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I left <name type="GPE">California</name>

pretty much right after.

</line>


<line>
Now I got the biggest hardware store

in <name type="GPE">Seattle</name>.

</line>


<line>
That's a lie. We're actually in <name type="GPE">Olympia</name>.

</line>


<line>
And I'm on the West End

playing <name type="PERSON">Juliet</name>'s... nurse.

</line>


<line>
-And how are your kids?

-I don't have any kids.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I just assumed

you had a bunch of kids,

</line>


<line>
'cause, you know, your body.

</line>


<line>
Come on, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
I assumed

you weren't still a massive cunt.

</line>


<line>
-Joelle.

-That's an okay thing to say in <name type="GPE">England</name>.

</line>


<line>
Shove it up your ass

with a spoonful of sugar,

you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

</line>


<line>
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.

-Let go of me!

</line>


<line>
-I'm gonna hulk out!

-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you're one to talk.

-What's that mean?

</line>


<line>
Were you being civil

when you had sex with my mom?

</line>


<line>
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which

one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-This sucks. You guys suck.

</line>


<line>
I don't even know

why I came to this party.

</line>


<line>
It's not a party, it's <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s funeral.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> died?

</line>


<line>
You know, maybe it's for the best

we don't get together that often.

</line>


<line>
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

</line>


<line>
Well, no one knows how to get

under your skin like family.

</line>


<line>
We're not a family, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
We probably won't even see each other

again, until the next funeral.

</line>


<line>
-Why are you all looking at me?

-You are the oldest.

</line>


<line>
You are a severe alcoholic.

</line>


<line>
I'm honestly so high right now,

I don't even know where I'm looking.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

</line>


<line>
Pardon me. Is one of you <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>?

</line>


<line>
I am. Of course. <name type="PERSON">God</name>, are you blind?

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
Well, forgive me.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>'s blind executor.

</line>


<line>
Per the instructions of his last will

and testament, I am to give you this disk.

</line>


<line>
Am I close?

</line>


<line>
Just take the disk from the guy.

</line>


<line>
It contains directions to <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s gold.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s gold?

</line>


<line>
There were no further details.

</line>


<line>
He was a peculiar client.

</line>


<line>
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

</line>


<line>
I'm just a blind man.

</line>


<line>
Still, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> thought me wise

for some reason.

</line>


<line>
Perhaps it is my overly formal

manner of speech.

</line>


<line>
I bid you good day.

</line>


<line>
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

</line>


<line>
Right at shin level.

</line>


<line>
What are we supposed to do

with a floppy disk?

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
So, what's up, kiddo?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and my mom

are becoming, like, friends

and they're acting real weird.

</line>


<line>
Oof! Uh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rattling overhead]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

</line>


<line>
There's somebody beneath you!

</line>


<line>
Jeez, all day with the...

</line>


<line>
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

</line>


<line>
You wanna check out

this cool new game I got?

</line>


<line>
You have solitaire? On your computer?

</line>


<line>
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

</line>


<line>
Wow!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s computer had a floppy disk drive.

</line>


<line>
I bet it's still in his old office.

Unless somebody else moved in.

</line>


<line>
Nobody wanted <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s office, remember?

</line>


<line>
Because it was under tap dancing star

<name type="PERSON">Savion Glover</name>'s office. Let's go.

</line>


<line>
-What? Right now?

-Yeah. Don't you get it?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s giving us a reunion special.

</line>


<line>
Remember how he always wanted to do

a treasure hunt episode of <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

but the network said it was too edgy?

This is that episode.

</line>


<line>
-I just don't know.

-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

</line>


<line>
Wait, so you'd rather just stay

at this funeral and be sad,

instead of going on a crazy adventure

to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

</line>


<line>
Do you have any idea

how insane you sound?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I get it.

You just don't wanna be here.

</line>


<line>
No, that's not it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> clearly wanted us to do this,

as a family.

</line>


<line>
Who cares what he wanted?

</line>


<line>
He doesn't, because he's dead.

</line>


<line>
And we all know he hated your guts.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. He was my best friend

and he died hating me

and nothing I do is gonna change that,

but <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> left you that disk

because he wanted us to find his gold.

</line>


<line>
If we can honor <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s last wish,

then that's something.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what, but it's something.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. For <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

-Fine.

</line>


<line>
-Shotgun!

-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

</line>


<line>
-before you see the car!

-My turn! Get out of my way!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Brad</name>, hang on one second.

</line>


<line>
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Hi, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
I loved you in that one episode

of <ital>Law &amp; Order: SVU.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
How would you like

to narrate a documentary for--

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

but today is about <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

so let's respect that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, I-- I'm so sorry.

</line>


<line>
I'll let you get back to your business.

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Winkly</name>, such a shame, isn't it?

About our friend <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
It really burns my brisket

that some people would turn a funeral

into some kind of schmoozefest.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know.

</line>


<line>
Those other people are the worst.

</line>


<line>
I bet that woman barely knew <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, hi, I'm <name type="PERSON">Henry</name>.

</line>


<line>
I used to volunteer with <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

at Habitat For Humanity.

</line>


<line>
Or as we like to call it,

Herbitat For Henranity. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
We spent most of the day working

on that name,

and only part of the day building,

but still, we helped some people.

</line>


<line>
-How did you know <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

-We also volunteered at a, um...

soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!

Whichever one is the good one.

</line>


<line>
What? I never knew you did that.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you

talk about how you knew <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I never met the guy.

I'm just here to schmooze.

</line>


<line>
Tell us about your thing, though,

it sounds fascinating.

</line>


<line>
Everyone, gather round and listen

to Princess Carolyn's story.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Wow, <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> kept all this old stuff.

</line>


<line>
He sure did.

</line>


<line>
Look, one of those answering machines

with tapes.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>, this is Manny from Pep Boys.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>We fixed the brakes on your car,</ital>

<ital>pick it up tomorrow.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Just to reiterate,</ital>

<ital>your brakes are in great shape</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and shouldn't give you any more trouble.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Unless, of course,</ital>

<ital>someone intentionally cut them,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but why would anyone do that?</ital>

<ital>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Probably because I'm such a big fan.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Horsin' Around<ital> was a goddamn riot!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I especially loved those kids.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You know, wasn't so crazy</ital>

<ital>about the horse, though--</ital>

</line>


<line>
Message deleted.

</line>


<line>
Mm... How curious.

</line>


<line>
How could you like <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

but not the horse?

</line>


<line>
That's like watching <ital>Castle</ital>

but hating castles.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I've never seen it.

I assume it's about castles.

</line>


<line>
-Wow!

-[all yell]

</line>


<line>
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

</line>


<line>
-How did you get here?

-I was in your trunk.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm in outer space.

</line>


<line>
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, can't I help?

</line>


<line>
Here's 10 bucks. There's a <name type="ORG">Squirt</name> machine

by the garage. Get five cans.

</line>


<line>
You got it. I won't let you down.

</line>


<line>
-[clattering, thumping]

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
Your mom, was her name <name type="PERSON">Karen</name>?

</line>


<line>
-Can we drop it?

-Something with a "K"?

</line>


<line>
Her name is <name type="PERSON">Nora</name>. You know,

my parents got a divorce because of you.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Nora</name>? I don't know.

I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

</line>


<line>
Okay, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>, you can do this.

</line>


<line>
Five Squirts.

</line>


<line>
You just need to take this money

and put it in that machine.

</line>


<line>
This-- Wait, what?

What happened to the $10?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No! Wind! Be cool!

</line>


<line>
-Hey! That's mine!

-[screeching]

</line>


<line>
-[screams]

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screeches]</nonVerbComm>

[thud]

</line>


<line>
Why does this always happen to me?

</line>


<line>
Looks like <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> set up a password.

</line>


<line>
Oh, this is easy. Try "<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>."

</line>


<line>
-No. Didn't work.

-"<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>-BFF"?

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>-I-Forgive-You"?

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm out of ideas.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
I'm just, like, so mad.

</line>


<line>
Well, you should be.

</line>


<line>
You're on the show

that fired <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>.

</line>


<line>
What are the writers doing to my baby?

Are they killing it?

</line>


<line>
Are they putting my baby into a car,

then driving the car into a lake?

</line>


<line>
Topical! I still got it!

</line>


<line>
They keep giving the best story lines

to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

</line>


<line>
I haven't gotten

a single very special episode.

</line>


<line>
When am I gonna learn

about drunk driving?

</line>


<line>
Don't worry so much.

It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna come out

smelling like a daisy.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You're a real actress,

you should be doing theater.

</line>


<line>
Hold on.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Joelle.

Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

</line>


<line>
Don't you have any friends

your own age from school?

</line>


<line>
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.

He's a photographer.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend

to support female solidarity.

</line>


<line>
-So scram!

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, be nicer to <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, will you?

She didn't choose this life.

</line>


<line>
Remember this word: family.

</line>


<line>
Okay? You two are family,

whether you like it or not,

and that's the most important thing.

You listening? What's the most important?

</line>


<line>
Family. It's family. I get it.

</line>


<line>
I've got it! The password is...

</line>


<line>
"password."

</line>


<line>
It worked!

</line>


<line>
Joelle.

</line>


<line>
So in that memory,

were you American?

</line>


<line>
The disk just has just one file on it,

it's--

</line>


<line>
It's the address of a storage locker

in <name type="GPE">Van Nuys</name>.

</line>


<line>
A storage locker? Ugh!

</line>


<line>
This treasure hunt sucks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[rattling overhead]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
At long last, can you keep down the noise,

keep down the funk?

</line>


<line>
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,

it would have caught on by now!

</line>


<line>
And when the mayor gave us the key

to the city,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.

It's about people."

</line>


<line>
-How touching.

-Good story.

</line>


<line>
-Who are you again?

-Wow, that was touching.

</line>


<line>
A story that could never be topped.

</line>


<line>
Or could it?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song

in the key of <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>.

</line>


<line>
You clearly knew the man so well.

</line>


<line>
Please tell us another story

but with even more details.

</line>


<line>
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

</line>


<line>
Tell us another story, Pink Cat <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>.

</line>


<line>
Story, story!

</line>


<line>
Come on, everybody.

What is this, a funeral?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Story, story, story!

</line>


<line>
Well, you blew it again.

</line>


<line>
You really are a dweeb.

</line>


<line>
Don't say that.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, who are you?

</line>


<line>
Some kind of magical trash troll?

</line>


<line>
No. I'm a janitor.

</line>


<line>
But I was clearing out some

of the old stages,

and I found this transformation chamber.

</line>


<line>
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you a story.

</line>


<line>
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb

of them all was <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> <name type="PERSON">Urkel</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
It was so funny how he never knew

whether or not he did that.

</line>


<line>
Right.

Well, nerdy <name type="PERSON">Steve</name> <name type="PERSON">Urkel</name> invented a machine

that transformed him

into the debonair <name type="PERSON">Stefan Urquelle</name>.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Janitor</name>, you're standing next

to a machine right now.

</line>


<line>
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

</line>


<line>
Now, this is just a prop.

</line>


<line>
But it represents a very powerful idea.

</line>


<line>
So if I go through that magic machine,

I'll become cool and confident?

</line>


<line>
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[inhales, exhales deeply]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I feel different.

-Now, son--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Todd</name>? Who's <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>?

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">Toad</name>. <name type="PERSON">Toad</name> Chavay.

</line>


<line>
And I gotta get my bubble on.

</line>


<line>
Machine? <name type="ORG">Squirt</name> me. Hi-yah!

</line>


<line>
That'll do, machine.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
Look at all this

<ital>Horsin' Around </ital>fan correspondence

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> received in the post. Capital!

</line>


<line>
Guys.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Someone already got to <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s gold.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
There's a bunch of fur in here.

</line>


<line>
It's bear fur.

</line>


<line>
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s nurse is a bear.

You think she knew about this gold?

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen to this letter.

I think it might be a clue.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ahem</name>. "<name type="PERSON">Dear <name type="PERSON">Herb</name></name>,

just finished reading your novel.

</line>


<line>
It's phenomenal.

</line>


<line>
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

</line>


<line>
Sincerely, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>,

the guy from that one episode

of <ital>Law &amp; Order: SVU."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> wrote a novel?

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

</line>


<line>
No, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>, I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.

I am for totes jel over here.

</line>


<line>
It's rectal cancer.

</line>


<line>
Ew! Some of us are eating.

</line>


<line>
Look, the reason I called you

is because I need a favor.

</line>


<line>
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

</line>


<line>
I want you to sober up.

</line>


<line>
First of all, rude. Second, gross.

And third, why?

</line>


<line>
I have a very important job for you,

but if you're zonked out all the time,

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure I can trust you

with the responsibility.

</line>


<line>
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniffing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I said tomorrow, right?

</line>


<line>
I've been working on this novel.

I wanna be remembered for something.

</line>


<line>
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom

that got ripped away from me.

</line>


<line>
But now, with this book,

I have something good.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

</line>


<line>
-It's my <name type="PERSON">Kazzaz</name>-terpiece.

-Whoa.

</line>


<line>
I want you to make sure

it gets published after I die.

</line>


<line>
You can count on me.

</line>


<line>
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, the gold is his manuscript.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> made me promise

to get it published after he died.

</line>


<line>
And you're just remembering this now?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.

The ketamine's wearing off.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>, you were the other kid

on <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That's why you've been following us

around all day.

</line>


<line>
So no one's read this book

except for <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>

</line>


<line>
-and now the book is missing?

-He must have been waiting for <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> to die

so he could steal the book

and publish it himself.

</line>


<line>
But then when the cancer went

into remission--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my <name type="PERSON">God</name>.

</line>


<line>
Guys, I don't think

that car crash was an accident.

</line>


<line>
I think <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> might have been murdered!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[huffing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What's going on?

</line>


<line>
Something about a merger?

</line>


<line>
My name's <name type="PERSON">Toad</name>, baby.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Coolsville</name>, daddy-o.

</line>


<line>
Oh, lookie here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Yo! That's my bike!

</line>


<line>
Oops. Did I do that?

</line>


<line>
Damn. I know I should be mad,

but that guy's just so cool.

</line>


<line>
And when the river finally stopped,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Herb</name> went over

to a poor little Ottawan boy

and he said, "<name type="PERSON">Son</name>, you have water now."

</line>


<line>
You know, a lot of people go their

whole lives and they never give a damn.

</line>


<line>
But <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>? He gave those beavers a dam.

</line>


<line>
That was beautiful.

</line>


<line>
You clearly had a special relationship.

</line>


<line>
We were gonna sprinkle <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

over the ocean,

but his resting place should be

someplace meaningful, don't you think?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you take this up to <name type="GPE">Ottawa</name>

and spread his ashes there.

</line>


<line>
And make sure you take a video,

and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

</line>


<line>
So we can always remember

your great friendship.

</line>


<line>
Everybody, stop!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name> is a stone-cold killer!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all gasp]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
What? I'm not a killer.

</line>


<line>
Unless you mean killer of gloom,

because I bring joy everywhere I go.

</line>


<line>
Did you mean "killer of gloom

because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

</line>


<line>
You know that's not what I meant.

</line>


<line>
You murdered <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

so you could publish his book.

</line>


<line>
But we're not gonna let you

steal his legacy, <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
I was afraid this would happen.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
No, I have <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s book.

</line>


<line>
I didn't kill <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>,

but I did steal his manuscript.

</line>


<line>
-So that I could burn it.

-What?

</line>


<line>
Because it's terrible.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll see for myself.

</line>


<line>
"The air in 1830s <name type="GPE">California</name> was fragrant

with the flowers of laughter

and the smoke of adventure."

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Uh.

</line>


<line>
After he died, <name type="PERSON">Tina</name> and I agreed

we couldn't let the book get published.

</line>


<line>
It would have turned <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>

into a laughingstock.

</line>


<line>
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

</line>


<line>
Hungry for crumpets.

But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

</line>


<line>
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

</line>


<line>
I know there's no accounting for taste,

but come on.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
He's right. <name type="PERSON">Herb</name> wanted a legacy,

but he already has one.

</line>


<line>
People loved <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

This would only ruin that.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,

American TV legend <name type="PERSON">Henry</name> <name type="PERSON">Winkler</name>.

</line>


<line>
No need to apologize.

</line>


<line>
You ascribed a mystery to <name type="PERSON">Herb</name>'s death

to give it meaning.

</line>


<line>
But there is no meaning in death.

</line>


<line>
That's why it's so terrifying.

</line>


<line>
It was just easier to believe

that you killed him for his book

than believe that he just died

for nothing.

</line>


<line>
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

</line>


<line>
That's why most people die.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, Horse <name type="PERSON">Guy</name>, but you can't.

</line>


<line>
Wow, heady stuff.

</line>


<line>
But let's not get distracted

from what a true friend

Princess Carolyn is.

</line>


<line>
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Fantastic.

</line>


<line>
Hey. Special delivery.

</line>


<line>
Courtesy of the <name type="PERSON">Toad</name>-man.

</line>


<line>
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up

your sleeves like that? You look weird.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I-- [coughs]

</line>


<line>
Well, you know, I was--

I was trying out a new look.

</line>


<line>
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

</line>


<line>
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

</line>


<line>
-Here's your <name type="ORG">Squirt</name>, sir.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
And if that happens, I want you

to take care of each other.

</line>


<line>
No matter what,

we're going to stick together.

</line>


<line>
-Congratulations!

-Hey, good job.

</line>


<line>
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.

-Anyone got coke?

</line>


<line>
ABC sent us limousines

to take us to the wrap party.

</line>


<line>
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

</line>


<line>
-Seriously, no one has coke?

-Let's go.

</line>


<line>
You don't wanna go to the party?

</line>


<line>
Nah.

</line>


<line>
Hey, we never got a chance

to walk around the lot.

</line>


<line>
Wanna check out that water tank

where they filmed <ital>The Love Boat?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding? I've always wanted

to get tanked in a tank.

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

-Shh.

</line>


<line>
-Quiet. Be careful.

-Oh, okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
You ready?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-What--? The water's only two inches deep.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
Are you scared at all?

</line>


<line>
That if the show takes off,

everything's going to change?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> No, I'm not scared, BJ.

The future is bright.

</line>


<line>
Just look at it.
