  <title>Old Acquaintance - <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> <name type="ORG">Horse</name>man</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
When you two first came into my office,

</line>


<line>
I was like,

"<name type="PERSON">T</name>his marriage is not going to last."

</line>


<line>
But you've really put the work in.

I deem your marriage fixed.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hanks, Dr. <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>.

</line>


<line>
We couldn't have done this wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut you

and your many novelty certificates.

</line>


<line>
Well, this has certainly been a big year

for the <name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name> marriage.

</line>


<line>
It certainly has.

</line>


<line>
But now it's New Year's Eve and, <name type="PERSON">Katie</name>,

my New Year's resolution to you

is to spend more time

with my wonderful wife, w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> I--

</line>


<line>
- [cell p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne rings]

- I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, um, but--

-Hello.

</line>


<line>
Hey, partner, big news. <name type="PERSON">Hu</name>ge news.

</line>


<line>
I'm all ears.

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he Flight of the <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name></ital>

just lost their lead.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey start s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting next week.

</line>


<line>
So what you're telling me is <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher

needs a new star i<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ediately

for his three-picture yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g adult

dystopian future franchise?

</line>


<line>
Yup. What's that I hear?

</line>


<line>
Beep beep.

Someone's calling on the other line.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's strange. Hello?

</line>


<line>
It's Oodles of <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ney calling.

Will we accept the charges?

</line>


<line>
Why would Oodles of <name type="PERSON">Mo</name>ney

be calling collect?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,

we cannot afford it.

</line>


<line>
I gotta go in. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But make sure

you're back before, you know.

</line>


<line>
Deal. Best deal I ever made.

[kisses]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name>om!

What's black and white and sexy all over?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Chuff</name> <name type="PERSON">Hollister</name>.

</line>


<line>
He's yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g, he's <name type="PERSON">ho</name>t,

he's <name type="NORP">Australian</name> or <name type="NORP">British</name> or whatever.

</line>


<line>
We can paint over his stripes

so he looks like a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse.

</line>


<line>
I can see the headline now:

<name type="ORG">Chuff</name> <name type="PERSON">Hollister</name> is...

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he next <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s got star power and grit

up the <name type="GPE">wazoo</name>. I can't imagine...

</line>


<line>
Anyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> would appeal

to the audience more than <name type="ORG">Chuff</name>.

</line>


<line>
He's got sex appeal...

</line>


<line>
- Gravitas...

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>uth...

</line>


<line>
- Experience...

- And abs coming out of the <name type="GPE">wazoo</name>.

</line>


<line>
And what a <name type="GPE">wazoo</name> it is.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>his would put <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>-<name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name>--

- On the map.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he map of profitable agencies, that is.

</line>


<line>
Perfect, because wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut it

we could be in--

</line>


<line>
Real trouble. We did not hit

our projected earnings for the year.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he year's not over yet.

We still have one day to go all out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Rutaba<name type="PERSON">ga</name></name>, do you think

we have the sp<name type="ORG">un</name>k and moxie--

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a good name

for a lady detective series.

</line>


<line>
--required to pull this off

and save the agency?

</line>


<line>
Hell yeah, I do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat would be a great title

for a movie about marrying Satan.

</line>


<line>
How are we losing money?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name>, we're getting <name type="ORG">Chuff</name> this part

and coming out on top.

</line>


<line>
I know we will,

because we're the good guys.

<line>
Suck a duck a duck a dick, <name type="GPE">dumbshi</name>t.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

<ital>- Hey, loser.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you get a call

about that <ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital> thing?

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do it, are you?

- I'm sorry, what thing?

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d, the <name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

sequel series <name type="PERSON">Brad</name>'s trying to get made?

</line>


<line>
He called to ask me, I asked him,

can you put a bullet in my brain?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat would probably be

a better career move.

</line>


<line>
Wait, slow down.

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you say <ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I know.

It s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld be <ital><name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d,</ital> right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w people would watch.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> doing cool skateboard tricks

and eating kettle corn.

</line>


<line>
Hold on, if this was a real thing,

why would <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> call you and not me?

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knows?

Why do people do anything?

</line>


<line>
Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma

from <ital><name type="GPE">Poca<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ntas</name></ital> my emergency contact?

</line>


<line>
Are you sure this w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le thing

isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream

</line>


<line>
from mi<name type="GPE">xin</name>g the wrong pills?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you not hear?

I'm clean and sober, eight months.

</line>


<line>
Really? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.

</line>


<line>
Because I heard

if you stop doing drugs for a while,

</line>


<line>
the first time you do them a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

it's amazing.

</line>


<line>
-What? No, just stay sober.

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Whatever.

Call me when you're ready to party.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Well, that's troubling.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe they're doing

a <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital> reboot wit<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ut me?

</line>


<line>
What do you care?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're about to be nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
Not the point. <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is about respect.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, is this really a good idea?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne rings]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're doing a new s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w

in the extended <ital><name type="PERSON">Horsin</name>' Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital>

</line>


<line>
cinematic <name type="ORG">un</name>iverse and you didn't call me?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital> is just an idea I had.

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's not officially happening or anything.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I would love for you to be part of it,

but the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rse died in the series finale.

</line>


<line>
So? We could write aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d that.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="ORG">Horse</name> dying was just a dream.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="ORG">Horse</name> had a twin brother,

comes back as a g<name type="PERSON">ho</name>st.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> missed the <name type="ORG">Horse</name> so much

he built a robot <name type="ORG">Horse</name> as a tribute.

</line>


<line>
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,

but this is ridiculous."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se are off the top of my head,

they're all gold.

</line>


<line>
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.

</line>


<line>
I've been having trouble

getting networks on the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne,

but with a big star like you attached,

we could sell this right away.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't say I'm attached...

</line>


<line>
Don't move.

I'm getting the next flight down to <name type="GPE">LA</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Right now?

- And purchased.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, for the last 20 years

</line>


<line>
I've been telling people

I didn't need the trappings of fame,

that I was better off,

happy with my little B-plus life

at my little B-plus hardware store

in little B-plus <name type="GPE">Olympia</name>, <name type="GPE">Washington</name>.

</line>


<line>
B-minus children. But it's a lie.

</line>


<line>
I miss the warmth of the spotlight

on my face.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he thrill of telling a joke

and feeling it land.

</line>


<line>
Is that a thrill you experienced?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he sitcom stage is my <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me,

and I'm tired of denying myself that.

</line>


<line>
I'm ready to come <name type="PERSON">ho</name>me.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you let me call him?

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Ah, smell that <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name> air.

Keep an eye out for my brother.

</line>


<line>
- How will I know which one's him?

- He's the one that looks like me.

</line>


<line>
- Got it.

- [ringtone] <ital>W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>'s that dog? Mister P--</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- Hey, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
Is this an okay time to talk business?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm just waiting

for Captain <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
What is that, like, a cereal?

</line>


<line>
No, my brother.

</line>


<line>
- He's picking us up at the airport.

- Nice.

</line>


<line>
Speaking of driving people places,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>

had a killer <name type="PERSON">ho</name>liday season

and I think New Year's

is going to be even bigger.

</line>


<line>
I'm loving that segue, <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are a conversational <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>gellan.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>urns out there's a huge <name type="NORP">dem</name>and

for a safe space for women. W<name type="PERSON">ho</name> knew?

</line>


<line>
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.

</line>


<line>
So I was thinking, what's the next step?

</line>


<line>
What if we made our safe space

for women...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[crashes]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
...also available to men?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's an <name type="ORG">un</name>tapped market.

</line>


<line>
All right, then it's agreed.

</line>


<line>
No goodbye?

</line>


<line>
He's a conversational <name type="PERSON">Amelia</name> Earhart.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter and

Captain <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter in the same room?

</line>


<line>
What is this, a flashback episode?

</line>


<line>
Captain <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, you old so-and-so.

</line>


<line>
- Get over here.

- [<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Careful.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[both laugh]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
Where's Mrs. Captain <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter?

</line>


<line>
She's in <name type="GPE">Alaska</name> r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning the Iditarod.

She sends her love.

</line>


<line>
And this <name type="PERSON">noogie</name>.

</line>


<line>
W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>o!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, this is my big brother.

</line>


<line>
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.

</line>


<line>
And you always will be.

</line>


<line>
It's nice to meet you, Captain.

</line>


<line>
Hey, put that thing away.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're family.

</line>


<line>
- [growls]

- [<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane] Oh!

</line>


<line>
So <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher is about to s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ot

the <ital>Flight of the <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name></ital> trilogy

in <name type="GPE">New Zealand</name>,

and <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is perfect for the lead.

</line>


<line>
A part like that would really <name type="ORG">un</name>derline

that <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s more than just an actor,

he's a movie star.

</line>


<line>
If I'm doing that,

I conveniently won't be able

to do that dumbass

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d</ital> s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell him

you don't want to do it?

</line>


<line>
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--

</line>


<line>
I slept with his mother.

</line>


<line>
- Gross.

- No.

</line>


<line>
I slept with her 20 years ago.

She was yo<name type="ORG">un</name>g then, not gross.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, loved you in

<ital><name type="PERSON">T</name>he <name type="PERSON">Caveman</name>'s Valentine.</ital>

<line>
Samuel L. <name type="PERSON">Jack</name>son had that big beard?

<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok it up.

</line>


<line>
- When you start laughing, call me.

- Will do.

</line>


<line>
Do we have an offer

on the <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name></ital> movie?

</line>


<line>
I'll get it, <name type="GPE">Kalamata</name>.

Don't get your pita in a wad.

</line>


<line>
Wow. <ital>Flight of the <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Now w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> let these little monsters

onto my peninsula?

</line>


<line>
We're your nephews.

</line>


<line>
What? I don't remember my nephews

being made out of candy.

</line>


<line>
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.

- [all laugh]

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at t<name type="PERSON">ho</name>se children.

Little miracles, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey're adorable, not that

I value them based on their looks.

</line>


<line>
Because, of course,

children in society today

are often reduced to their cuteness.

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to get

to know your children as people,

so I can specifically

compliment them individually

on the fo<name type="ORG">un</name>dation of their characters.

</line>


<line>
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
- Do you believe in the soul?

- What?

</line>


<line>
Life is the most precious resource

we have. Remember that, <name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> Pretty great, right?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you tell your brother

about the A-B-O-R-<name type="PERSON">T</name>-I-O-N?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he audition?

No, I could never tell him about that.

</line>


<line>
He thinks I'm offer-only,

it would break his heart.

</line>


<line>
Wait, what audition?

</line>


<line>
- No, the abortion.

- Oh, no. S<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld I have?

</line>


<line>
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he kind of stuff you'd hear

in a sad <name type="PERSON">Creed</name> song.

</line>


<line>
Or a happy <name type="PERSON">Elliott Smith</name> song.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,

but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, that's a <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> expression.

I guess in human terms it would be:

</line>


<line>
He's all talk, and no s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>oting you

with an assault rifle.

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think humans do?

</line>


<line>
Am I wrong?

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[<name type="PERSON">Rutaba<name type="PERSON">ga</name></name>]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> <name type="PERSON">Bo</name>om! <name type="PERSON">T</name>his is <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher.

</line>


<line>
And this is everyone w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> works for him.

</line>


<line>
Now <name type="ORG">un</name>fort<name type="ORG">un</name>ately for us,

everyone on this board

must really like their boss's movies,

because for the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>lidays,

they're all <ital>Gone Girl.</ital>

<line>
Wait a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond, I know that face.

Why does she look so familiar?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, fish.

- Oh, fish.

</line>


<line>
So when I fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d out

that the best assistant I ever had

was working for <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher,

</line>


<line>
I mean, what are the odds?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d he hire you because of your cute

little Benjamin Button-nose?

</line>


<line>
I'll put in a good word for <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

but I'm just an assistant.

</line>


<line>
Just an assistant?

<name type="PERSON">Laura</name>, assistants are everything.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're the first people in,

the last people out.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know everyone's real name, age,

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have power, because in today's economy

the only true power is information.

</line>


<line>
I want you to use that power.

</line>


<line>
I want you to get your boss

to pick <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> as his <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name>.

</line>


<line>
I always believed in you, <name type="PERSON">Laura</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he question is:

do you believe in yourself?

</line>


<line>
Wow, that's--

I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

</line>


<line>
Because that was--

Is that a speech you had ready to go?

</line>


<line>
- Will you do this for me?

- Of course.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u went to bat for me when I tried

to get a promotion at <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name>.

</line>


<line>
I pushed so hard for you.

I did everything I could.

</line>


<line>
I mean, we <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ls gotta look out

for each other. Right?

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[th<name type="ORG">un</name>der cracks]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So you're talking about a merger?

</line>


<line>
Since my dad croaked

I've been r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name> myself,

and I've been doing a pretty good job,

A-minus/B-plus.

</line>


<line>
But I could use a few more experienced

hands to help guide the ship,

</line>


<line>
- because being a boss is really hard.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn can be a proud woman.

I'm glad you came to me first.

</line>


<line>
I would have gone to her directly,

but sometimes she yells at me

and I do not like being yelled at

and that is just something that people

need to <name type="ORG">un</name>derstand about me.

</line>


<line>
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

</line>


<line>

<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[th<name type="ORG">un</name>der]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

</line>


<line>
So on the new s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> is the dad,

and he's raising three little <name type="PERSON">ho</name>rses.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u couldn't have told me

this over the p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w is going to change my life.

</line>


<line>
I'm taking the kids out of sc<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ol

and moving everyone down here.

</line>


<line>
I just had an offer accepted

on a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use in <name type="GPE">Sherman Oaks</name>.

</line>


<line>
As long as I don't change my mind

before the new year, boom.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>wo million dollars, gone.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>he new year? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's tonight.

- I know.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Di</name>d you talk to my agent

by any chance?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- She didn't call you?

</line>


<line>
I talked to her, and I don't know

if she wants me to do it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w agents are.

</line>


<line>
Just remember,

I'm not the bad guy here.

</line>


<line>
I hear you loud and clear.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry.

We won't take no for an answer.

</line>


<line>
I think my schedule's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be tough--

Might be going to <name type="GPE">New Zealand</name>.

</line>


<line>
We'll work aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d your schedule.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name><name type="PERSON">ho</name>se bastards got my quote

so damn high.

</line>


<line>
We'll pay it.

No obstacle is insurmo<name type="ORG">un</name>table.

</line>


<line>
- As long as you want to do it.

- And I do want to do it.

</line>


<line>
Get me out of this thing.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his ass<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le's giving me everything

I ask for. What a nightmare.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">T</name>ell him you don't want to do the s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

- I can't. It would destroy him.

</line>


<line>
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

so I don't think about the people

I'm destroying.

</line>


<line>
Do you not know what an agent is?

</line>


<line>
- [knocking]

- [<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>] <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>, are you okay in there?

</line>


<line>
Is it number one or number two?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat cat's r<name type="ORG">un</name>ning circles aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d us.

What are we going to do?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe we can distract her?

I'm thinking laser pointer.

</line>


<line>
If we're going to beat her,

we need to think like her.

</line>


<line>
Instead of convincing the <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name></ital>

people they don't want <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

what if we convince <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>

he doesn't want <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name>?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Fantastic. How do we do that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>? <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's what I said when

they said you wanted to meet with me.

</line>


<line>
I figured you never wanted

to see me a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in.

</line>


<line>
I never want to see anyone a<name type="PERSON">ga</name>in,

but there's a book I've been trying

to turn into a movie and I need your help.

</line>


<line>
It's a coming-of-age story

about a girl w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> likes jellybeans.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he option expires tonight at midnight,

<name type="ORG">un</name>less I can find a big enough star

to <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure f<name type="ORG">un</name>ding.

</line>


<line>
Frankly, I already <name type="PERSON">ga</name>ve up on it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen my agent said,

"<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s interested."

</line>


<line>
So the reason

you think I'm right for the role

is because I'm a big enough star

to <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure f<name type="ORG">un</name>ding?

</line>


<line>
Don't get smart, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're not good at it.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're really giving the hard sell here.

</line>


<line>
I hear they've got you locked in

to some fantasy dystopia thing.

</line>


<line>
Are you just <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> do stupid bullshit

for the rest of your life?

</line>


<line>
For work or, like, in general?

</line>


<line>
I saw something in you,

something most people don't know you have,

and it kills me that instead

of sharing it with the world,

you want to hide it <name type="ORG">un</name>der some

wonderland <name type="ORG">un</name>icorn nonsense.

</line>


<line>
It's a <name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name>. Unicorns are for babies.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he movie I want to make

isn't glamorous or sexy.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u don't get to be the big hero

everybody loves.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u get to be a guy

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> works at a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>s station,

w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> gets in a fight with his daughter

about jellybeans.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's the w<name type="PERSON">ho</name>le movie.

It's small and it's real.

</line>


<line>
And you'd get to work

with a director w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> sees you.

</line>


<line>
And I can't sell it any better than that.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're right, that one scene

we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>t that didn't even make it

into the <ital><name type="ORG">Secre</name>tariat </ital>movie

was the best thing I ever did.

</line>


<line>
Why am I wasting my time

with this other stuff?

</line>


<line>
- So you're in?

- Let's do it.

</line>


<line>
Great. How's your little friend

with the face?

</line>


<line>
Is he up to his old tricks,

getting into scrapes?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[laughs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>> What a little scamp.

Will you tell him I said hi?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>'s movie so<name type="ORG">un</name>ds perfect.

</line>


<line>
Is it the nobody's-<name type="PERSON">gonna</name>-see-it element

or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his jellybean thing could s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w the world

that <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>'s more than just a movie star.

</line>


<line>
- He's an actor.

- Yeah, well, that's great,

but I've been working all day

on getting him the <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name> </ital>movie

you said would s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w the world

he's a movie star.

</line>


<line>
I don't want that anymore.

I want to do something real.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u realize <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w much money

we'd be walking away from?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his isn't about money.

Doesn't matter to me.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.

- Right. So what's the problem?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you can find a way

for <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> to do both?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're supposed to be

this amazing agent, after all.

</line>


<line>
I'll see what I can do.

</line>


<line>
New beers for the new year's?

</line>


<line>
We got a regular

<name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ya Angelou over here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Goo</name>d times.

</line>


<line>
- [cell p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne <name type="GPE">rings]-</name>

- Oh, it's <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd. Gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
- <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ybe you can call him back later?

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>odd!

</line>


<line>
Don't be too long,

or I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> drink all your beer.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[sighs]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<name type="PERSON">Di</name>ane, do you ever look up at the stars

and feel like

they're tiny <name type="PERSON">ho</name>les in the sky,

sucking out all the oxygen,

and suddenly you can't breathe

because you're thinking about <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w small

you are and <name type="PERSON">ho</name>w meaningless it all is?

</line>


<line>
Uh... I guess.

</line>


<line>
It's so cruel to let people love you.

</line>


<line>
All you're doing is promising

you'll one day break their hearts.

</line>


<line>
Cool fire pit.

</line>


<line>
So it turns out men love safe spaces

for women even more than women do.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u gotta read some of these co<name type="PERSON">mm</name>ents.

<name type="ORG">Queefburglar69</name> says:

</line>


<line>
"<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese sexy lady chauffeurs

always get me where I need to go."

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's <name type="ORG">un</name>ambiguous.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he only problem is some of the drivers

have been complaining

about the new customer base.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>he workers are allowed to complain?

We gotta tighten up that ship.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Mo</name>st of the new passengers

are perfect gentlemen,

but we've fo<name type="ORG">un</name>d that a growing number

are rating our drivers

not on performance but on "ban<name type="PERSON">ga</name>bility",

which creates an <name type="ORG">un</name>fair advantage

for our "ban<name type="PERSON">ga</name>ble" drivers

and creates what some

of our more <name type="PERSON">ho</name>mely employees

have dubbed a <name type="PERSON">ho</name>stile sexy-ocracy.

W<name type="PERSON">ho</name>a!

</line>


<line>
Well, our first priority is creating

a safe space for women,

so if our women

don't feel safe in that space,

we s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld replace them

with women w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> do.

</line>


<line>
Where can we find women w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> are

comfortable aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d gentlemen?

</line>


<line>
I know. A gentleman's club.

</line>

</line>


<line>
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

but I pulled some strings and you're in.

</line>


<line>
I always knew you were a superstar.

</line>


<line>
Let's get drinks in the new year

and work out the <name type="ORG">deets--</name>

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's a fast way of saying details

for people w<name type="PERSON">ho</name> don't have time

for every detail of the word details.

<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name> on line two.

<line>
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

</line>


<line>
I'm <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> bat her aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d

like a ball of foil.

</line>


<line>
I know you're excited, but we are still

in a very precarious position,

and I wonder if foil-ball-batting

is the best tack here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>, this is where I live.

Watch and learn.

</line>


<line>
Hey, we heard <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>

had a great meeting on <ital><name type="ORG">Jelly</name> <name type="ORG">Belle</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Gotta tie this up tonight

if it's going to happen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> would love to do the movie,

but you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have to work

aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d his <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name></ital> schedule.

</line>


<line>
Oh, um... <name type="PERSON">T</name>hat might be tricky.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hen you're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have to match

his <ital><name type="ORG">Pe<name type="PERSON">ga</name>sus</name> </ital>quote.

</line>


<line>
- He won't do it for a penny less.

- Princess <name type="PERSON">Carol</name>yn--

</line>


<line>
Even with a star like <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> can't get that kind of money.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, work aro<name type="ORG">un</name>d his schedule.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're overplaying your hand, PC,

and I'm calling your bluff.

</line>


<line>
I'm barreling towards you fast, <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>,

and this <name type="PERSON">Ma</name>ck truck ain't <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> blink.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat's not fair. I was clearly

establishing a poker metap<name type="PERSON">ho</name>r,

you just changed it to a <name type="PERSON">ga</name>me of chicken.

I had in seventh grade?

- <name type="PERSON">T</name>alk to me, soldier.

It's the <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name> New Year's party.

<name type="PERSON">T</name>hese are our drivers.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, where's <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>?

</line>


<line>
She left.

She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

</line>


<line>
She certainly didn't feel comfortable

paying for the food she ate.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbCo<name type="PERSON">mm</name>>

<line>
I got champagne for my real friends,

'cause that's what you are.

</line>


<line>
- A real friend.

- He doesn't want to do your s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>w.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name> is about to win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think he would want

to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

about the further adventures

of a carb-faced nobody?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, maybe--

- <name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u are not a television star.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u have no talent and I am forgetting

your face even as I'm looking at it.

</line>


<line>
Pack your bags.

Go back to <name type="GPE">Nowheresville</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hank you for the champagne.

Best re<name type="PERSON">ga</name>rds, <name type="PERSON">Ana</name> Spanakopita.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, the <name type="PERSON">ho</name>use!

I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. I dropped my p<name type="PERSON">ho</name>ne in a bog.

</line>


<line>
Something is going on with your brother.

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u need to talk to him.

</line>


<line>
We don't really have the kind of

relationship where we talk about things.

</line>


<line>
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u know what they say about dogs?

<name type="PERSON">T</name>alking to each other is rrruff.

</line>


<line>
I'm serious, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter.

</line>


<line>
And I'm serious that you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld drop it.

</line>


<line>
If something was really wrong,

he would tell me about it.

</line>


<line>
Would he?

</line>


<line>
I know he's your brother,

but he's hiding something from you.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think you know my brother

better than I do?

</line>


<line>
Just because you have a shitty

relationship with your family

doesn't mean every other family

has to have drama too.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to come up here

and have a nice time.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>his place is an escape for me.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld not have s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uted at you.

I just...

</line>


<line>
I need to go for a walk.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, hey.

- Hey, is there something going on?

</line>


<line>
Because I know there isn't,

but if there is, you would tell me, right?

</line>


<line>
But there's nothing to tell,

because nothing bad ever happens

on the <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, I think you s<name type="PERSON">ho</name>uld sit down.

- Why?

</line>


<line>
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.

- I will not sit down.

</line>


<line>
- Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, sit.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
- I got a twisted spleen.

- No.

</line>


<line>
It's not fatal, necessarily.

Everything's <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> be fine.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hey still have to r<name type="ORG">un</name> some tests.

</line>


<line>
- But it's going to be fine?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Promise me it's going to be fine?

<name type="PERSON">Yo</name>u're my big brother.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">T</name>hat means you can't lie to me about this.

</line>


<line>
Mr. <name type="PERSON">Peanut</name>butter, you are the best

r<name type="ORG">un</name>t of the litter a guy could ask for.

</line>


<line>
No, don't do this.

</line>


<line>
- But there might come a time...

- Please.

</line>


<line>
...when you're going

to have to be the captain.

I do want to do your movie.

</line>

It's a mistake I keep making.

Next time, <name type="PERSON">Bo</name><name type="PERSON">Jack</name>?

Do a girl a favor,

It'll save everyone some time.

We're <name type="PERSON">gonna</name> have to cut some costs.

Our social media division

If things don't perk up the first quarter,

we might be looking at broader layoffs.

Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?

I don't know.
