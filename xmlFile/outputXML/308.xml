<line>
When you two first came into my office,

</line>


<line>
I was like,

"This marriage is not going to last."

</line>


<line>
But you've really put the work in.

I deem your marriage fixed.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, Dr. <name type="PERSON">Janet</name>.

</line>


<line>
We couldn't have done this without you

and your many novelty certificates.

</line>


<line>
Well, this has certainly been a big year

for the <name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name> marriage.

</line>


<line>
It certainly has.

</line>


<line>
But now it's New Year's Eve and, <name type="PERSON">Katie</name>,

my New Year's resolution to you

is to spend more time

with my wonderful wife, who I--

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone rings]

- I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, um, but--

-Hello.

</line>


<line>
Hey, partner, big news. Huge news.

</line>


<line>
I'm all ears.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Flight of the Pegasus</ital>

just lost their lead.

</line>


<line>
They start shooting next week.

</line>


<line>
So what you're telling me is <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher

needs a new star immediately

for his three-picture young adult

dystopian future franchise?

</line>


<line>
Yup. What's that I hear?

</line>


<line>
Beep beep.

Someone's calling on the other line.

</line>


<line>
That's strange. Hello?

</line>


<line>
It's Oodles of Money calling.

Will we accept the charges?

</line>


<line>
Why would Oodles of Money

be calling collect?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,

we cannot afford it.

</line>


<line>
I gotta go in. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay. But make sure

you're back before, you know.

</line>


<line>
Deal. Best deal I ever made.

[kisses]

</line>


<line>
Boom!

What's black and white and sexy all over?

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Chuff</name> <name type="PERSON">Hollister</name>.

</line>


<line>
He's young, he's hot,

he's <name type="NORP">Australian</name> or <name type="NORP">British</name> or whatever.

</line>


<line>
We can paint over his stripes

so he looks like a horse.

</line>


<line>
I can see the headline now:

<name type="ORG">Chuff</name> <name type="PERSON">Hollister</name> is...

</line>


<line>
The next Pegasus.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s got star power and grit

up the wazoo. I can't imagine...

</line>


<line>
Anyone who would appeal

to the audience more than <name type="ORG">Chuff</name>.

</line>


<line>
He's got sex appeal...

</line>


<line>
- Gravitas...

- Youth...

</line>


<line>
- Experience...

- And abs coming out of the wazoo.

</line>


<line>
And what a wazoo it is.

</line>


<line>
- This would put <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>-<name type="PERSON">Rabitowitz</name>--

- On the map.

</line>


<line>
The map of profitable agencies, that is.

</line>


<line>
Perfect, because without it

we could be in--

</line>


<line>
Real trouble. We did not hit

our projected earnings for the year.

</line>


<line>
The year's not over yet.

We still have one day to go all out.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name>, do you think

we have the spunk and moxie--

</line>


<line>
That's a good name

for a lady detective series.

</line>


<line>
--required to pull this off

and save the agency?

</line>


<line>
Hell yeah, I do.

</line>


<line>
That would be a great title

for a movie about marrying Satan.

</line>


<line>
How are we losing money?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name>, we're getting <name type="ORG">Chuff</name> this part

and coming out on top.

</line>


<line>
I know we will,

because we're the good guys.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[funky electronic music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
Suck a duck a duck a dick, dumbshit.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, <name type="PERSON">Sarah</name> <name type="PERSON">Lynn</name>.

<ital>- Hey, loser.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Did you get a call

about that <ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Around</ital> thing?

</line>


<line>
- You're not gonna do it, are you?

- I'm sorry, what thing?

</line>


<line>
<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Around, the Horsin' Around</ital>

sequel series <name type="PERSON">Brad</name>'s trying to get made?

</line>


<line>
He called to ask me, I asked him,

can you put a bullet in my brain?

</line>


<line>
That would probably be

a better career move.

</line>


<line>
Wait, slow down.

Did you say <ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
I know.

It should be <ital><name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> Around,</ital> right?

</line>


<line>
That's a show people would watch.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sabrina</name> doing cool skateboard tricks

and eating kettle corn.

</line>


<line>
Hold on, if this was a real thing,

why would <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> call you and not me?

</line>


<line>
Who knows?

Why do people do anything?

</line>


<line>
Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma

from <ital>Pocahontas</ital> my emergency contact?

</line>


<line>
Are you sure this whole thing

isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream

</line>


<line>
from mixing the wrong pills?

</line>


<line>
Did you not hear?

I'm clean and sober, eight months.

</line>


<line>
Really? That's incredible.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.

</line>


<line>
Because I heard

if you stop doing drugs for a while,

</line>


<line>
the first time you do them again,

it's amazing.

</line>


<line>
-What? No, just stay sober.

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Whatever.

Call me when you're ready to party.

</line>


<line>
- [tires screech]

- [crashes]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horn honks]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well, that's troubling.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe they're doing

a <ital>Horsin' Around</ital> reboot without me?

</line>


<line>
What do you care?

You're about to be nominated for an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
Not the point. This is about respect.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, is this really a good idea?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Tools. <name type="PERSON">Brad</name> speaking.

</line>


<line>
You're doing a new show

in the extended <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

</line>


<line>
cinematic universe and you didn't call me?

</line>


<line>
Hey, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Around</ital> is just an idea I had.

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's not officially happening or anything.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I would love for you to be part of it,

but the horse died in the series finale.

</line>


<line>
So? We could write around that.

The Horse dying was just a dream.

</line>


<line>
The Horse had a twin brother,

comes back as a ghost.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> missed the Horse so much

he built a robot Horse as a tribute.

</line>


<line>
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,

but this is ridiculous."

</line>


<line>
Those are off the top of my head,

they're all gold.

</line>


<line>
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.

</line>


<line>
I've been having trouble

getting networks on the phone,

but with a big star like you attached,

we could sell this right away.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't say I'm attached...

</line>


<line>
Don't move.

I'm getting the next flight down to LA.

</line>


<line>
- Right now?

- And purchased.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, for the last 20 years

</line>


<line>
I've been telling people

I didn't need the trappings of fame,

that I was better off,

happy with my little B-plus life

at my little B-plus hardware store

in little B-plus <name type="GPE">Olympia</name>, <name type="GPE">Washington</name>.

</line>


<line>
B-minus children. But it's a lie.

</line>


<line>
I miss the warmth of the spotlight

on my face.

</line>


<line>
The thrill of telling a joke

and feeling it land.

</line>


<line>
Is that a thrill you experienced?

</line>


<line>
The sitcom stage is my home,

and I'm tired of denying myself that.

</line>


<line>
I'm ready to come home.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you let me call him?

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Ah, smell that <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name> air.

Keep an eye out for my brother.

</line>


<line>
- How will I know which one's him?

- He's the one that looks like me.

</line>


<line>
- Got it.

- [ringtone] <ital>Who's that dog? Mister P--</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Hello?

- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Is this an okay time to talk business?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm just waiting

for Captain Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
What is that, like, a cereal?

</line>


<line>
No, my brother.

</line>


<line>
- He's picking us up at the airport.

- Nice.

</line>


<line>
Speaking of driving people places,

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name>

had a killer holiday season

and I think New Year's

is going to be even bigger.

</line>


<line>
I'm loving that segue, <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>.

You are a conversational Magellan.

</line>


<line>
Turns out there's a huge demand

for a safe space for women. Who knew?

</line>


<line>
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.

</line>


<line>
So I was thinking, what's the next step?

</line>


<line>
What if we made our safe space

for women...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crashes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
...also available to men?

</line>


<line>
That's an untapped market.

</line>


<line>
All right, then it's agreed.

</line>


<line>
No goodbye?

</line>


<line>
He's a conversational <name type="PERSON">Amelia Earhart</name>.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter and

Captain Peanutbutter in the same room?

</line>


<line>
What is this, a flashback episode?

</line>


<line>
Captain Peanutbutter, you old so-and-so.

</line>


<line>
- Get over here.

- [<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Careful.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
She's in <name type="GPE">Alaska</name> running the Iditarod.

She sends her love.

</line>


<line>
And this noogie.

</line>


<line>
Whoo!

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, this is my big brother.

</line>


<line>
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.

</line>


<line>
And you always will be.

</line>


<line>
It's nice to meet you, Captain.

</line>


<line>
Hey, put that thing away.

You're family.

</line>


<line>
- [growls]

- [<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>] Oh!

</line>


<line>
So <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher is about to shoot

the <ital>Flight of the Pegasus</ital> trilogy

in <name type="GPE">New Zealand</name>,

and <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is perfect for the lead.

</line>


<line>
A part like that would really underline

that <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s more than just an actor,

he's a movie star.

</line>


<line>
If I'm doing that,

I conveniently won't be able

to do that dumbass

<ital><name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> Around</ital> show.

</line>


<line>
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell him

you don't want to do it?

</line>


<line>
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--

</line>


<line>
I slept with his mother.

</line>


<line>
- Gross.

- No.

</line>


<line>
I slept with her 20 years ago.

She was young then, not gross.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, loved you in

<ital>The Caveman's Valentine.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Hmm?

- Nothing? <ital>The Caveman's Valentine?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Samuel L. <name type="PERSON">Jackson</name> had that big beard?

Look it up.

</line>


<line>
- When you start laughing, call me.

- Will do.

</line>


<line>
Do we have an offer

on the <ital>Pegasus</ital> movie?

</line>


<line>
I'll get it, <name type="GPE">Kalamata</name>.

Don't get your pita in a wad.

</line>


<line>
Wow. <ital>Flight of the Pegasus.</ital>

</line>


<line>
This must be

what <name type="PERSON">Robert Downey</name> Jr. felt like

when he woke up on that

stranger's bathroom floor

and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on radio]</nonVerbComm> <ital>It's another unseasonably</ital>

<ital>warm day in the <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and things are looking sunny</ital>

<ital>all the way to the new year.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It really is true what they say...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both]</nonVerbComm> Nothing bad ever happens

on the <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name>.

</line>


<line>
Oh, paradise.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[children laugh]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Uncle Mister. Uncle Mister.

</line>


<line>
Now who let these little monsters

onto my peninsula?

</line>


<line>
We're your nephews.

</line>


<line>
What? I don't remember my nephews

being made out of candy.

</line>


<line>
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.

- [all laugh]

</line>


<line>
Look at those children.

Little miracles, right?

</line>


<line>
They're adorable, not that

I value them based on their looks.

</line>


<line>
Because, of course,

children in society today

are often reduced to their cuteness.

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to get

to know your children as people,

so I can specifically

compliment them individually

on the foundation of their characters.

</line>


<line>
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
- Do you believe in the soul?

- What?

</line>


<line>
Life is the most precious resource

we have. Remember that, <name type="PERSON">Diane</name>.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Pretty great, right?

</line>


<line>
Did you tell your brother

about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

</line>


<line>
The audition?

No, I could never tell him about that.

</line>


<line>
He thinks I'm offer-only,

it would break his heart.

</line>


<line>
Wait, what audition?

</line>


<line>
- No, the abortion.

- Oh, no. Should I have?

</line>


<line>
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

</line>


<line>
The kind of stuff you'd hear

in a sad <name type="PERSON">Creed</name> song.

</line>


<line>
Or a happy <name type="PERSON">Elliott Smith</name> song.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,

but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, that's a <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> expression.

I guess in human terms it would be:

</line>


<line>
He's all talk, and no shooting you

with an assault rifle.

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think humans do?

</line>


<line>
Am I wrong?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[<name type="PERSON">Rutabaga</name>]</nonVerbComm> Boom! This is <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher.

</line>


<line>
And this is everyone who works for him.

</line>


<line>
Now unfortunately for us,

everyone on this board

must really like their boss's movies,

because for the holidays,

they're all <ital>Gone Girl.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Thank you, except for her. Boom.

</line>


<line>
The assistant to <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher's

casting director.

</line>


<line>
Wait a second, I know that face.

Why does she look so familiar?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, fish.

- Oh, fish.

</line>


<line>
So when I found out

that the best assistant I ever had

was working for <name type="PERSON">David</name> Pincher,

</line>


<line>
I mean, what are the odds?

</line>


<line>
Did he hire you because of your cute

little <name type="PERSON">Benjamin Button</name>-nose?

</line>


<line>
I'll put in a good word for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

but I'm just an assistant.

</line>


<line>
Just an assistant?

<name type="PERSON">Laura</name>, assistants are everything.

</line>


<line>
You're the first people in,

the last people out.

</line>


<line>
You know everyone's real name, age,

nose, teeth, and tits.

</line>


<line>
You have power, because in today's economy

the only true power is information.

</line>


<line>
I want you to use that power.

</line>


<line>
I want you to get your boss

to pick <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> as his Pegasus.

</line>


<line>
I always believed in you, <name type="PERSON">Laura</name>.

</line>


<line>
The question is:

do you believe in yourself?

</line>


<line>
Wow, that's--

I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

</line>


<line>
Because that was--

Is that a speech you had ready to go?

</line>


<line>
- Will you do this for me?

- Of course.

</line>


<line>
You went to bat for me when I tried

to get a promotion at <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name>.

</line>


<line>
I pushed so hard for you.

I did everything I could.

</line>


<line>
I mean, we gals gotta look out

for each other. Right?

</line>


<line>
Right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thunder cracks]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So you're talking about a merger?

</line>


<line>
Since my dad croaked

I've been running <name type="PERSON">Vigor</name> myself,

and I've been doing a pretty good job,

A-minus/B-plus.

</line>


<line>
But I could use a few more experienced

hands to help guide the ship,

</line>


<line>
- because being a boss is really hard.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.

I'm glad you came to me first.

</line>


<line>
I would have gone to her directly,

but sometimes she yells at me

and I do not like being yelled at

and that is just something that people

need to understand about me.

</line>


<line>
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[thunder]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
So on the new show <name type="PERSON">Ethan</name> is the dad,

and he's raising three little horses.

</line>


<line>
You couldn't have told me

this over the phone?

</line>


<line>
This show is going to change my life.

</line>


<line>
I'm taking the kids out of school

and moving everyone down here.

</line>


<line>
I just had an offer accepted

on a house in <name type="GPE">Sherman Oaks</name>.

</line>


<line>
As long as I don't change my mind

before the new year, boom.

</line>


<line>
Two million dollars, gone.

</line>


<line>
- The new year? That's tonight.

- I know.

</line>


<line>
Did you talk to my agent

by any chance?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- She didn't call you?

</line>


<line>
I talked to her, and I don't know

if she wants me to do it.

</line>


<line>
You know how agents are.

</line>


<line>
Just remember,

I'm not the bad guy here.

</line>


<line>
I hear you loud and clear.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry.

We won't take no for an answer.

</line>


<line>
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--

Might be going to <name type="GPE">New Zealand</name>.

</line>


<line>
We'll work around your schedule.

</line>


<line>
Those bastards got my quote

so damn high.

</line>


<line>
We'll pay it.

No obstacle is insurmountable.

</line>


<line>
- As long as you want to do it.

- And I do want to do it.

</line>


<line>
Get me out of this thing.

</line>


<line>
This asshole's giving me everything

I ask for. What a nightmare.

</line>


<line>
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.

- I can't. It would destroy him.

</line>


<line>
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

so I don't think about the people

I'm destroying.

</line>


<line>
Do you not know what an agent is?

</line>


<line>
- [knocking]

- [<name type="PERSON">Ethan</name>] <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>, are you okay in there?

</line>


<line>
Is it number one or number two?

</line>


<line>
That cat's running circles around us.

What are we going to do?

</line>


<line>
Maybe we can distract her?

I'm thinking laser pointer.

</line>


<line>
If we're going to beat her,

we need to think like her.

</line>


<line>
Instead of convincing the <ital>Pegasus</ital>

people they don't want <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

what if we convince <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>

he doesn't want <ital>Pegasus?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Fantastic. How do we do that?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>? That's what I said when

they said you wanted to meet with me.

</line>


<line>
I figured you never wanted

to see me again.

</line>


<line>
I never want to see anyone again,

but there's a book I've been trying

to turn into a movie and I need your help.

</line>


<line>
It's a coming-of-age story

about a girl who likes jellybeans.

</line>


<line>
The option expires tonight at midnight,

unless I can find a big enough star

to secure funding.

</line>


<line>
Frankly, I already gave up on it.

</line>


<line>
Then my agent said,

"Maybe <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s interested."

</line>


<line>
So the reason

you think I'm right for the role

is because I'm a big enough star

to secure funding?

</line>


<line>
Don't get smart, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

You're not good at it.

</line>


<line>
You're really giving the hard sell here.

</line>


<line>
I hear they've got you locked in

to some fantasy dystopia thing.

</line>


<line>
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit

for the rest of your life?

</line>


<line>
For work or, like, in general?

</line>


<line>
I saw something in you,

something most people don't know you have,

and it kills me that instead

of sharing it with the world,

you want to hide it under some

wonderland unicorn nonsense.

</line>


<line>
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.

</line>


<line>
The movie I want to make

isn't glamorous or sexy.

</line>


<line>
You don't get to be the big hero

everybody loves.

</line>


<line>
You get to be a guy

who works at a gas station,

who gets in a fight with his daughter

about jellybeans.

</line>


<line>
That's the whole movie.

It's small and it's real.

</line>


<line>
And you'd get to work

with a director who sees you.

</line>


<line>
And I can't sell it any better than that.

</line>


<line>
You're right, that one scene

we shot that didn't even make it

into the <ital>Secretariat </ital>movie

was the best thing I ever did.

</line>


<line>
Why am I wasting my time

with this other stuff?

</line>


<line>
- So you're in?

- Let's do it.

</line>


<line>
Great. How's your little friend

with the face?

</line>


<line>
Is he up to his old tricks,

getting into scrapes?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> What a little scamp.

Will you tell him I said hi?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>'s movie sounds perfect.

</line>


<line>
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element

or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

</line>


<line>
This jellybean thing could show the world

that <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>'s more than just a movie star.

</line>


<line>
- He's an actor.

- Yeah, well, that's great,

but I've been working all day

on getting him the <ital>Pegasus </ital>movie

you said would show the world

he's a movie star.

</line>


<line>
I don't want that anymore.

I want to do something real.

</line>


<line>
You realize how much money

we'd be walking away from?

</line>


<line>
This isn't about money.

Doesn't matter to me.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.

- Right. So what's the problem?

</line>


<line>
Maybe you can find a way

for <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> to do both?

</line>


<line>
You're supposed to be

this amazing agent, after all.

</line>


<line>
I'll see what I can do.

</line>


<line>
New beers for the new year's?

</line>


<line>
We got a regular

<name type="PERSON">Maya Angelou</name> over here.

</line>


<line>
Good times.

</line>


<line>
- [cell phone rings]-

- Oh, it's <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>. Gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
- Maybe you can call him back later?

- <name type="PERSON">Todd</name>!

</line>


<line>
Don't be too long,

or I'm gonna drink all your beer.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

<name type="PERSON">Diane</name>, do you ever look up at the stars

and feel like

they're tiny holes in the sky,

sucking out all the oxygen,

and suddenly you can't breathe

because you're thinking about how small

you are and how meaningless it all is?

</line>


<line>
Uh... I guess.

</line>


<line>
It's so cruel to let people love you.

</line>


<line>
All you're doing is promising

you'll one day break their hearts.

</line>


<line>
Cool fire pit.

</line>


<line>
So it turns out men love safe spaces

for women even more than women do.

</line>


<line>
You gotta read some of these comments.

<name type="ORG">Queefburglar69</name> says:

</line>


<line>
"These sexy lady chauffeurs

always get me where I need to go."

</line>


<line>
That's unambiguous.

</line>


<line>
The only problem is some of the drivers

have been complaining

about the new customer base.

</line>


<line>
The workers are allowed to complain?

We gotta tighten up that ship.

</line>


<line>
Most of the new passengers

are perfect gentlemen,

but we've found that a growing number

are rating our drivers

not on performance but on "bangability",

which creates an unfair advantage

for our "bangable" drivers

and creates what some

of our more homely employees

have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.

Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Well, our first priority is creating

a safe space for women,

so if our women

don't feel safe in that space,

we should replace them

with women who do.

</line>


<line>
Where can we find women who are

comfortable around gentlemen?

</line>


<line>
I know. A gentleman's club.

</line>


<line>
That's perfect.

</line>


<line>
To <name type="ORG">Whale World</name>.

</line>


<line>
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

but I pulled some strings and you're in.

</line>


<line>
I always knew you were a superstar.

</line>


<line>
Let's get drinks in the new year

and work out the deets--

That's a fast way of saying details

for people who don't have time

for every detail of the word details.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Vanessa</name> <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name> on line two.

</line>


<line>
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna bat her around

like a ball of foil.

</line>


<line>
I know you're excited, but we are still

in a very precarious position,

and I wonder if foil-ball-batting

is the best tack here.

</line>


<line>
<name type="GPE">Judah</name>, this is where I live.

Watch and learn.

</line>


<line>
Hey, we heard <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> and <name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>

had a great meeting on <ital>Jelly <name type="ORG">Belle</name>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Gotta tie this up tonight

if it's going to happen.

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> would love to do the movie,

but you're gonna have to work

around his <ital>Pegasus</ital> schedule.

</line>


<line>
Oh, um... That might be tricky.

</line>


<line>
Then you're gonna have to match

his <ital>Pegasus </ital>quote.

</line>


<line>
- He won't do it for a penny less.

- Princess Carolyn--

</line>


<line>
Even with a star like <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>,

<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name> can't get that kind of money.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, work around his schedule.

</line>


<line>
You're overplaying your hand, PC,

and I'm calling your bluff.

</line>


<line>
I'm barreling towards you fast, <name type="PERSON">Gekko</name>,

and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.

</line>


<line>
That's not fair. I was clearly

establishing a poker metaphor,

you just changed it to a game of chicken.

</line>


<line>
My court. My rules.

</line>


<line>
<name type="ORG">Court</name>? What game are you playing?

</line>


<line>
Bye.

</line>


<line>
- Damn it!

- Question:

</line>


<line>
Am I the faulty bike tire pump

I had in seventh grade?

</line>


<line>
Because I just blew this thing wide open.

</line>


<line>
- Talk to me, soldier.

- I have been scouring old emails.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know what I was looking for.

I knew there was something.

</line>


<line>
And I found it. Bam!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Hot shit on a ham sandwich,

this is amazing!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringtone]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Sweet</name> crap on a croissant,

<name type="PERSON">Katie</name>'s going into labor!

</line>


<line>
Go, I'll take care of this.

Family comes first.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. You make me stronger.

Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

</line>


<line>
It's the <name type="PERSON">Cabracadabra</name> New Year's party.

These are our drivers.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, where's <name type="PERSON">Emily</name>?

</line>


<line>
She left.

She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

</line>


<line>
She certainly didn't feel comfortable

paying for the food she ate.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I got champagne for my real friends,

'cause that's what you are.

</line>


<line>
- A real friend.

- He doesn't want to do your show.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> is about to win an <name type="PERSON">Oscar</name>.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think he would want

to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

about the further adventures

of a carb-faced nobody?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, maybe--

- You are not a television star.

</line>


<line>
You have no talent and I am forgetting

your face even as I'm looking at it.

</line>


<line>
Pack your bags.

Go back to <name type="GPE">Nowheresville</name>.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for the champagne.

Best regards, <name type="PERSON">Ana</name> Spanakopita.

</line>


<line>
Oh, <name type="PERSON">God</name>, the house!

I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.

</line>


<line>
Something is going on with your brother.

You need to talk to him.

</line>


<line>
We don't really have the kind of

relationship where we talk about things.

</line>


<line>
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

</line>


<line>
You know what they say about dogs?

Talking to each other is rrruff.

</line>


<line>
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
And I'm serious that you should drop it.

</line>


<line>
If something was really wrong,

he would tell me about it.

</line>


<line>
Would he?

</line>


<line>
I know he's your brother,

but he's hiding something from you.

</line>


<line>
Why do you think you know my brother

better than I do?

</line>


<line>
Just because you have a shitty

relationship with your family

doesn't mean every other family

has to have drama too.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to come up here

and have a nice time.

</line>


<line>
This place is an escape for me.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I should not have shouted at you.

I just...

</line>


<line>
I need to go for a walk.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, hey.

- Hey, is there something going on?

</line>


<line>
Because I know there isn't,

but if there is, you would tell me, right?

</line>


<line>
But there's nothing to tell,

because nothing bad ever happens

on the <name type="GPE">Labrador</name> <name type="LOC">Peninsula</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, I think you should sit down.

- Why?

</line>


<line>
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.

- I will not sit down.

</line>


<line>
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
- I got a twisted spleen.

- No.

</line>


<line>
It's not fatal, necessarily.

Everything's gonna be fine.

</line>


<line>
They still have to run some tests.

</line>


<line>
- But it's going to be fine?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Promise me it's going to be fine?

You're my big brother.

</line>


<line>
That means you can't lie to me about this.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the best

runt of the litter a guy could ask for.

</line>


<line>
No, don't do this.

</line>


<line>
- But there might come a time...

- Please.

</line>


<line>
...when you're going

to have to be the captain.

</line>


<line>

What happened?

</line>


<line>
It's a no-go on <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> for <ital>Pegasus.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I don't understand, <name type="PERSON">Laura</name>. I...</ital>

</line>


<line>
I just wanted you to know.

I did everything I could.

</line>


<line>
- Hey.

- [<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>] <ital>Look...</ital>

</line>


<line>
If you didn't wanna do my movie,

you should have just told me.

</line>


<line>
I do want to do your movie.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent

keep demanding more money?

</line>


<line>
<ital>- What?</ital>

- The option's expired and I'm screwed.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up?

Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up?

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">Kelsey</name>, this is a mistake.

</line>


<line>
It's a mistake I keep making.

Next time, <name type="PERSON">BoJack</name>?

</line>


<line>
Do a girl a favor,

don't break her heart by inches.

</line>


<line>
Do it all at once.

It'll save everyone some time.

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crowd]</nonVerbComm> Ten, nine, eight...

</line>


<line>
Oh, good, you're still here.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to get a head start

on the 2016 budget.

</line>


<line>
It'll be a challenge, but assuming

<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> books <ital>Pegasus--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<name type="PERSON">BoJack</name> didn't book <ital>Pegasus.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- So he's doing the jellybean movie?

- That fell apart, too.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna have to cut some costs.

</line>


<line>
Our social media division

is a luxury we can no longer afford.

</line>


<line>
If things don't perk up the first quarter,

we might be looking at broader layoffs.

</line>


<line>
- Do you ever read a room?

- I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

</line>


<line>
Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?

I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you run that through

your robot analysis protocol?

</line>


<line>
Get back to me

once you've assessed the data.

</line>


<line>
I am not a robot. I am a human being.

</line>


<line>
You want to make some cuts?

Why don't you cut that stupid beard?

</line>


<line>
Everyone who walks in here thinks

this place is run by a homeless person.

</line>


<line>
I apologize if my appearance

or demeanor is unprofessional.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> No, you're perfect.

Everybody's perfect except for me.

</line>


<line>
Go home, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.

</line>


<line>
- Would you like me to shave the beard?

- Just go home, <name type="GPE">Judah</name>.
