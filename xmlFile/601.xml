  <title>A Horse Walks into a Rehab - BoJack Horseman</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>Sarah Lynn.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Sarah Lynn?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[stammers] <ital>I don't have a lot to tell.</ital>

<ital>She called me.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She sounded a little off. I... </ital>[sighs]

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, I drove to the planetarium,</ital>

<ital>and I found her passed out.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I called 911 right away,</ital>

<ital>but it was too late.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[crickets chirping]

</line>


<line>
-I'm so sorry.

-[cries]

</line>


<line>
I did everything I could.

</line>


<line>
It's my fault. I'm a terrible mother.

</line>


<line>
-No. It's no one's fault.

-[sobs]

</line>


<line>
So, you don't know

where Sarah Lynn got the heroin from?

</line>


<line>
-I have no idea.

-Alrighty then.

</line>


<line>
That's the only question I had.

</line>


<line>
I mean, of course I knew

she was doing a lot of drugs.

</line>


<line>
But that's who she was. Who I was.

</line>


<line>
It felt like we could keep

partying forever

</line>


<line>
-and it wouldn't catch up with us.

-Got it. Don't need any more information.

</line>


<line>
I was in a bad way.

</line>


<line>
And Sarah Lynn followed me down

because she thought I was a safe place.

</line>


<line>
What have I done?

</line>


<line>
Just to be clear, the case is closed.

</line>


<line>
You can stop rambling.

</line>


<line>
[whistles tune]

</line>


<line>
I gotta make some changes in my life.

</line>


<line>
Starting now.

</line>


<line>
[bottles clink]

</line>


<line>
[gulping]

</line>


<line>
[distorted theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
[bell dinging]

</line>


<line>
-I need help. Hello? Ah!

-Checking in.

</line>


<line>
-Welcome to Pastiches Malibu!

-Great.

</line>


<line>
I see you have the six-week package, so...

a hundred thousand dollars, please!

</line>


<line>
A hundred thou-- Jesus!

</line>


<line>
Does every room come

with a free bag full of $90,000?

</line>


<line>
-Can't put a price on clean living.

-And yet somehow you found a way.

</line>


<line>
Before I take you to your room,

could we get a selfie?

</line>


<line>
What? No.

</line>


<line>
Every client that comes here

takes a picture with me.

</line>


<line>
Goes on the wall. Kind of a tradition...

</line>


<line>
I'm not in the mood.

I look awful, first of all.

</line>


<line>
Johnny Depp did it, and he looked

just as puffy and ghoulish as you do.

</line>


<line>
Hey, groundhog. I said no.

Why don't you go see your own shadow

</line>


<line>
so I can get six more weeks

of "Leave Me the Hell Alone"?

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, sir.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

Now if you'll kindly direct me to my room,

</line>


<line>
I would like to begin

the process of healing,

</line>


<line>
so I can finally stop hurting

the people around me, dipshit!

</line>


<line>
[pants, sighs]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
So, when I went to the country club

for Sheila's luncheon...

</line>


<line>
Yes. Let it out.

</line>


<line>
I had to wear the same suit

I had just worn to Sandra's tea party.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-[woman] Oh.

</line>


<line>
I think of that as my rock bottom. [sobs]

</line>


<line>
Denise, thank you

for sharing your story. So brave.

</line>


<line>
Denise, we are powerless

</line>


<line>
-over our addictions

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
We have a saying in rehab,

"Everyone takes a different road

</line>


<line>
to get to the same city,

Soberopolis, USA."

</line>


<line>
Hold on a sec. What?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, maybe you could tell us

when was the first time you drank?

</line>


<line>
When wasn't the first time I drank?

</line>


<line>
-Am I right?

-[all laugh]

</line>


<line>
Your last day's tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
You think you're ready

to go back into the world?

</line>


<line>
I do. I feel good, I feel clear.

</line>


<line>
You know, just because you cleaned

the tobacco out of your teeth

don't mean it's your wedding day,

pardon the expression.

</line>


<line>
I don't believe that is an expression.

</line>


<line>
I notice you tend to deflect

whenever I ask you

about the source of your addiction.

</line>


<line>
I don't deflect.

Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.

</line>


<line>
You understand a joke about deflection

is still a deflection, right?

</line>


<line>
I came here to take responsibility

for myself,

and all I keep hearing is,

"It's not your fault,

you are powerless over your addiction."

</line>


<line>
-That is the first step.

-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?

</line>


<line>
That is way too many.

Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.

</line>


<line>
Did you see <ital>12 Years a Slave</ital>

and think, "Twelve. That's a short number

of years to be a slave"?

</line>


<line>
-You're deflecting again.

-I'm here because I made choices.

</line>


<line>
Nobody made me drink.

</line>


<line>
My addiction didn't pull a knife on me

and say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol,

or I'm gonna strangle you.

</line>


<line>
After I put down this knife,

which now seems unnecessary."

</line>


<line>
-We have a saying in the sober community.

-No kidding.

</line>


<line>
"We want what our addictions

want us to want,

in the same way that our future

is just a house built from the materials

of our present on the blueprint

that is our past."

</line>


<line>
See, usually the point of sayings

is they illustrate complicated concepts

via straightforward allegory.

</line>


<line>
I really admire

that your sayings don't do that.

</line>


<line>
If you don't wanna be here,

you don't have to wait until tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
The gate code is 12,

for the number of steps,

then my mom's birthday,

which is March 4th, '56.

</line>


<line>
So, the gate code

is one, two, three, four, five, six?

</line>


<line>
You can leave whenever you'd like.

But is that really what you want?

</line>


<line>
[sighs] No.

</line>


<line>
It's so beautiful.

</line>


<line>
And I know a lot about art

because my husband owns

a Jackson Pollock. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
My dad owns a signed picture

of Kevin Pollak.

</line>


<line>
-[yelps]

-What about you, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
Did you grow up in a house

with a lot of art?

</line>


<line>
Well, my parents practiced

the art of being terrible parents.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you can't joke your way

through this.

</line>


<line>
Everyone else in this group

is trying hard to be honest.

</line>


<line>
Really? Everyone's being honest?

</line>


<line>
Doug over here,

who keeps dressing in a suit and tie

even though he's never getting

his finance job back?

</line>


<line>
-[woman gasps]

-Oh! Savage!

</line>


<line>
And Joan Tripplehorn?

</line>


<line>
We all know you're just Jeanne Tripplehorn

wearing fake glasses!

</line>


<line>
-[all gasp]

-[chuckles] What? No!

</line>


<line>
I'm Jeanne's identical twin Joan.

</line>


<line>
Mm, Jeanne Tripplehorn. Not an alcoholic.

</line>


<line>
And that guy with the fake mustache

is obviously actor Jay Hernandez

who's just here to do research for a role.

</line>


<line>
-[all gasp]

-No. I'm a no "Hernandez."

</line>


<line>
Like I say, my name is Mario.

Directed by Zack Snyder.

</line>


<line>
I'm addicted to pain pills from breaking

too many bricks on my head.

</line>


<line>
BoJack's right! You all suck!

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, well, let's talk about Jameson.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
-I'd rather you not.

-She would love to get sober

but still has her friend McCaitlyn

sneak her water bottles

filled with vodka every visiting day.

</line>


<line>
-[all gasp]

-Jameson?

</line>


<line>
-Um...

-Have you been smuggling in alcohol?

</line>


<line>
How is this my fault?

I blame water for being vodka-colored!

</line>


<line>
This is your fifth time in rehab.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh?

-BoJack...

</line>


<line>
Everyone, just as a general rule,

if you're checking into rehab

more than once,

</line>


<line>
-either you're a lost cause...

-[all gasp]

</line>


<line>
...or this is just an industry

that profits off of repeat customers,

so maybe they don't have

your best interest at heart.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-How's that for honest?

</line>


<line>
Mamma mia.

</line>


<line>
-[blows]

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka

because I have to make it through

six weeks of this bullshit.

</line>


<line>
I don't even need to be here.

</line>


<line>
My dad totally overreacted

when he found me not breathing.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's always

someone else's fault, right?

</line>


<line>
-You have no idea what I've been through.

-I know everything you've been through.

</line>


<line>
I listen in group!

Your mom died of cancer.

</line>


<line>
Your dad stuck you in boarding school

and remarried.

</line>


<line>
And now there's a new baby

and no one pays attention to you.

</line>


<line>
But it's not his fault

you're drinking in rehab.

</line>


<line>
I was sober for most of last year

and he just waited for me to slip up

so he could ship me here

so I wouldn't embarrass him

and ruin his new perfect family--

</line>


<line>
Hey, if you don't wanna be here,

the gate code is one, two,

three, four, five, six.

</line>


<line>
You could sneak out the upstairs window

after midnight bed check

by tying your sheets into a rope

and nobody would notice

you're gone until wake-up.

</line>


<line>
But... is that what you really want?

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
[door closes]

</line>


<line>
[studio audience laughing]

</line>


<line>
Holy sheet!

</line>


<line>
I've heard of being at the end

of my rope...

but this is ridiculous!

</line>


<line>
Why would Sabrina run away like that?

</line>


<line>
Because I had to break it to her that you

weren't going to be her new mommy,

international supermodel Cindy Crawfish!

</line>


<line>
When I was flying to Paris

for Paris Fashion Week

and my private plane crashed

into your backyard,

the one thing I never expected

was to find someone so special.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-[both chuckle]

</line>


<line>
[audience] Aw!

</line>


<line>
-Cut! That's a five, everyone!

-[bell ringing]

</line>


<line>
So, look, you're doing everything great.

</line>


<line>
I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on,

couldn't be better, perfect.

</line>


<line>
The one problem is the kiss got an "aw."

</line>


<line>
It's supposed to get an "Ooh!"

</line>


<line>
-Right?

-I'm nervous, okay?

</line>


<line>
This is my first on-camera kiss,

and it's with Cindy Crawfish.

</line>


<line>
You know how many guys would kill

to be in your shoes?

</line>


<line>
What do I gotta do?

</line>


<line>
Kiss you on the lips myself

to show you what a real kiss looks like?

</line>


<line>
-[kisses]

-Ha-ha-ha!

</line>


<line>
-No. I'll handle it.

-Well, I sure as hell hope so.

</line>


<line>
[gulps] Mm.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, what's in this orange juice?

-Just a little extra punch.

</line>


<line>
Oh. No, no, I don't--

</line>


<line>
Trust me. It'll loosen you up.

</line>


<line>
The one thing I never expected...

was to find someone so special.

</line>


<line>
-[Cindy] Hmm!

-[audience] Ooh!

</line>


<line>
-[Herb] Love it! Cut and scene!

-[bell ringing]

</line>


<line>
Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.

Let's do one more take!

</line>


<line>
-You up for more acting, Cindy?

-[audience whooping]

</line>


<line>
Well, if it's for the show.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Sharona,

how 'bout some more of that OJ?

</line>


<line>
-[Jameson grunting] Whoa! Ow.

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Holy sheet.

</line>


<line>
I've heard of being at the end of my rope,

but this...

is very serious!

</line>


<line>
-[exhales]

-Jameson!

</line>


<line>
Don't cut the string that connects you

to the kite that is you!

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs] What?

-I don't know!

</line>


<line>
I was just trying to come up

with one of those dumb rehab sayings!

</line>


<line>
McCaitlyn told me Dathan

was thinking of breaking up with me

because I got fat junior year.

</line>


<line>
So, I need to go show him

that I'm back to being hot.

</line>


<line>
Then break up with him

for being a shallow buck foy!

</line>


<line>
You don't need to do that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, what does it matter?

We both know this place is bullshit!

</line>


<line>
So, why do you care what I do?

</line>


<line>
Because I'm the idiot

who helped you escape.

</line>


<line>
So, if you OD tonight,

then I'm the one who'll have to lie

to everyone about what happened.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm going.

</line>


<line>
You can come with me if you want.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] God damn it.

</line>


<line>
[party music playing]

</line>


<line>
[Jameson chuckles] Oh!

</line>


<line>
This is your boyfriend's house?

</line>


<line>
-You can't go in there.

-I'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
I'll just find Dathan,

crush him with my thigh gap,

</line>


<line>
-and then we can go.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Dathan? Where are you?

</line>


<line>
It's me, Jameson H.!

</line>


<line>
[people laughing]

</line>


<line>
[gasps]

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
[panting continues]

</line>


<line>
-[knocking on door]

-[boy] Hey, who's in there?

</line>


<line>
-Um...

-Is someone having sex in there?

</line>


<line>
I think there are people

having sex in there.

</line>


<line>
Hey, it was just the nerd.

</line>


<line>
Definitely no one having sex in here.

</line>


<line>
-[thuds]

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
Um. Oh. Mm.

</line>


<line>
You're BoJack from Spanish 1, right?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, yeah. I mean, <ital>sí!</ital>

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Okay. <ital>"Sí"</ital> ya around. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Ah, yeah, bye, Katie.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! You want a beer, Horseman?

-Oh, no, thank you.

</line>


<line>
I mean, drinking's cool,

it's just that we're underage,

</line>


<line>
-and, you know, the law--

-I'm lifting 178 right now.

</line>


<line>
-[keg clangs]

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
You know what? I'll have one beer.

</line>


<line>
[pops]

</line>


<line>
Okay, who am I? Who am I?

</line>


<line>
-"I'm Eric from chemistry class!"

-[laughter]

</line>


<line>
That's so Eric! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
He is so in chemistry class!

</line>


<line>
Speaking of losers, there's Josh!

</line>


<line>
Look, he's wearing K-Mart shoes

because his family's poor!

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Katie's not laughing because she always

thinks she's better than everyone.

</line>


<line>
Hey, remember last year

when one of Katie's boobs

grew bigger than the other?

</line>


<line>
[groans] "Look at me, I'm Katie!"

</line>


<line>
[laughter continues]

</line>


<line>
[Katie sobs]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, you want some?

-Oh, yeah. Bartender, one more.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-[Jameson screaming]

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
-What's wrong?

-Dathan's sucking McCaitlyn's face!

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. Jameson.

</line>


<line>
Okay. It is not what it looks like,

I swear.

</line>


<line>
You're still doing it!

</line>


<line>
-I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.

-[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
I told you things weren't going great.

</line>


<line>
Oh, Dathan, touch my boob.

</line>


<line>
Do not touch her boob!

</line>


<line>
Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.

</line>


<line>
I mean, how many times

have you been to rehab?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Jameson.

</line>


<line>
[cries]

</line>


<line>
[Dathan and McCaitlyn moaning]

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
Look, it's okay.

You were gonna break up with him anyway.

</line>


<line>
-And your friend sucks.

-No, they're right.

</line>


<line>
I'm a mess. And no one cares.

God damn it! I might as well drink.

</line>


<line>
-No. You don't need a drink.

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
You need to get back to bed

and get some sleep.

</line>


<line>
You're right. I'm gonna go home

and sleep in my bed!

</line>


<line>
And when my dad shows up

to ask why I'm not in rehab,

</line>


<line>
I'll be like, "Maybe <ital>you </ital>should go

to rehab for <ital>your </ital>addiction

to being a shitty dad, Dad!"

</line>


<line>
Okay, Jameson,

you need to be responsible for yourself.

</line>


<line>
Now, I think that you should come back

to Pastiches with me, like you promised.

</line>


<line>
But if you wanna go to your dad's house,

all you have to do is steal Dathan's car,

and I heard Michele with one "L"

is about to jump naked into the pool,

so everyone's gonna be distracted,

which means this is the perfect time.

</line>


<line>
-But is that really what you want?

-[car engine revving]

</line>


<line>
-[Jameson] Bye, BoJack! Thanks!

-What the...

</line>


<line>
God damn it! [grunts]

</line>


<line>
Stupid... [mumbling]

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-[touch tones beeping]

</line>


<line>
[buzzing]

</line>


<line>
[sniffs] Hello?

</line>


<line>
I need you to find the address

of some rich guy.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack?

-All I know for sure

is that he's the father of a girl

named Jameson, who's super annoying.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to assume you have a good reason

to locate a girl

in the middle of the night,

but I can't help you.

</line>


<line>
Fine! Be that way. Todd'll help me.

</line>


<line>
-Can you patch me through to Todd?

-What? Call him yourself.

</line>


<line>
I don't know his number.

</line>


<line>
I only remember your number because it was

such a dumb number with all those fours.

</line>


<line>
Four, four, six, four...

</line>


<line>
My phone number

has a normal amount of fours.

</line>


<line>
You are not gonna make me

self-conscious about--

</line>


<line>
And it ends with a three!

</line>


<line>
Talk about an anti-climax!

</line>


<line>
What kind of phone number

ends with a three?

</line>


<line>
Shut up about my phone number!

</line>


<line>
-Hold for Todd.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
Todd's phone. Your one-stop shop

for all your Todd-related needs.

</line>


<line>
Todd, I need you to track down

an address for me.

</line>


<line>
You're the world's best hacker, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but not the kind of hacker

you're thinking of.

</line>


<line>
-Funny story--

-Okay, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
-I'm at Coachella...

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Put my name on the wrong list,

suddenly I've entered

into a hacky sack competition!

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-Prior to these events,

</line>


<line>
-I've never hacked a sack in my life.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
But the only other contender is

the Russian ringer they flew in special,

so I'm thinking,

</line>


<line>
-"I've gotta win this for America!"

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Long story short, the Russian had

a heart attack, so I won by default!

</line>


<line>
Uh, does that answer your question?

</line>


<line>
I don't remember my question,

but I'm gonna guess no.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, hold on, I'm getting another call.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
Todd's phone!

Spare the Todd, spoil the child!

</line>


<line>
Did you get the black market

porcupine milk?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'll bring it right over.

</line>


<line>
Although, I'm not looking forward

to getting on a crowded bus

</line>


<line>
-in Porcupine Town.

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Hold on. Getting another call.

-[phone buzzes]

</line>


<line>
Hey, superstar!

How are things goin' on set?

</line>


<line>
Well, the movie itself

is coming together beautifully,

but when I was on break

playing with my model helicopter,

it crashed into the studio water tower.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no!

-It gets worse!

</line>


<line>
It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown

Julie Brown's new puppet show.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Completely ruining her vintage

goose-feather dress

she just bought

and disrupting the big finale

where her wooden puppet plays

Beethoven's Fifth on the bongos!

</line>


<line>
Wait. You're telling me

your dumb drone downed a tower

and drowned Downtown Julie Brown's

dummy drumming dum-dum-dum-dum,

dousing her newly found,

goose-down, hand-me-down gown?

</line>


<line>
-Yes, that is exactly right!

-I'll be right down.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, I gotta go.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
[muffled music playing over speakers]

</line>


<line>
-So, sounds like rehab's goin' well, huh?

-No!

</line>


<line>
[groaning]

</line>


<line>
Hey, give me my phone back.

</line>


<line>
I'm expecting some timely feedback

on an important dick pic.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you know where Jameson lives?

</line>


<line>
Jameson H.? Or Jameson Q.?

</line>


<line>
-Ugh, I don't know.

-Or Jameson M.?

</line>


<line>
Where is the nearest Jameson?

</line>


<line>
-[door closes]

-[BoJack] Whoa.

</line>


<line>
Is that the car

from <ital>Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.

And this car is his baby.

</line>


<line>
At least... No, it was his baby

before the new baby came.

</line>


<line>
Now the new baby's the baby,

which means the car is the new me,

so where does that leave me? Nowhere.

</line>


<line>
What are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
He threw out all of my stuff

and turned my room into the baby's room.

</line>


<line>
He got rid of my softball trophies,

but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.

</line>


<line>
-And his dumb stupid car!

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
-[crying]

-Parents are terrible.

</line>


<line>
But destroying things

isn't gonna change them.

</line>


<line>
All you can change is you.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Fine.

</line>


<line>
If I'm gonna get lectured anyway,

I may as well go back to rehab.

</line>


<line>
-[glass shattering]

-[woman moans]

</line>


<line>
Dad, you there?

</line>


<line>
Mom said since you didn't come home,

I should bring you your dinner.

</line>


<line>
And she said to tell you she hopes

you like cold, burnt pot roast

that was spit on.

</line>


<line>
-[woman moaning]

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
Dad?

</line>


<line>
There it is, coax it out of my sheath.

</line>


<line>
[gasps]

</line>


<line>
BoJack! What the devil!

</line>


<line>
I-- I'll get right on that memo,

Mr. Horseman.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let me... Oops, oh. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Okay, let me just...

Oh, you look so cute. Bye-bye. All right.

</line>


<line>
-What were you doing, Dad?

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
It's fun to have you

at the office, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-You're really turning into a man.

-I am?

</line>


<line>
I think you're old enough now

to have a Jack and Coke.

</line>


<line>
Mm, nice and sweet.

</line>


<line>
Here's to our first drink

as father and son.

</line>


<line>
[car horns honking]

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
-Did I fall asleep? I feel sick.

-[laughs]

</line>


<line>
You went a little wild.

You made a mess on my carpet, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I think your mother

would be very disappointed in you.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's best if we both just forgot

about everything that happened tonight.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, buddy?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
You know what? Screw your dad.

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Hey! That's the titular club

from <ital>The First Wives Club.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You're just a kid.

</line>


<line>
Why do you have to be responsible

for all the ways he screwed you up?

</line>


<line>
Yeah!

</line>


<line>
[grunts]

</line>


<line>
It's not my fault I was born!

He's the one who got my mom pregnant!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and I bet your mom sucked too!

</line>


<line>
[gasps] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
Chick ch'ka... Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my...

-[thuds]

</line>


<line>
-[both sigh]

-[car squeaks]

</line>


<line>
[glass cracking]

</line>


<line>
-Wha...

-Oh, boy.

</line>


<line>
-[door opens]

-[baby crying]

</line>


<line>
What the hell are you doing?

</line>


<line>
That's the giant window from <ital>The Graduate!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Daddy, I didn't wanna leave rehab,

but this scary old horse made me!

</line>


<line>
Hi, cutie! Mwah!

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.

I'll go wait in the car!

</line>


<line>
Jameson... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Listen--

-Are you drunk or high?

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Are you drunk or high right now?

</line>


<line>
-No.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry she roped you into this.

</line>


<line>
You're not the first guy to help her

break out of that rehab.

</line>


<line>
They always end up at my house.

</line>


<line>
And then they want me to keep quiet

to the press,

so they give me a souvenir

from one of their movies.

</line>


<line>
I could send you a swag bag

from Felicity Huffman's <ital>Booty Academy,</ital>

but you should probably wash the thong

before wearing it.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to do with Jameson.

I've tried everything.

</line>


<line>
I thought she would change

after she had her baby, but...

</line>


<line>
[baby cooing]

</line>


<line>
Change is hard.

</line>


<line>
Takes a long time.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Let me guess,

she wanted to see her boyfriend?

</line>


<line>
Actually...

she told me she just wanted

to come here to see her baby.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] Wouldn't that be nice?

</line>


<line>
Bye, Daddy! Love you!

</line>


<line>
-Ugh. Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.

-Jesus Christ.

</line>


<line>
You have no idea how lucky you are.

</line>


<line>
I wish I had someone when I was your age

who cared about me enough

to put me in rehab.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, maybe.

</line>


<line>
Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me

out of trouble tonight.

</line>


<line>
Really?

</line>


<line>
It was a worth a try.

Ready to sneak back in?

</line>


<line>
I'm getting too old to sneak in

and out of places.

</line>


<line>
All right.

</line>


<line>
[bell dinging]

</line>


<line>
-Checking in?

-No.

</line>


<line>
I just snuck out and I'm coming back,

so, you know, put me down

for kitchen clean-up duty

or whatever the punishment is

for sneaking out.

</line>


<line>
No, I don't think you've been here before.

</line>


<line>
Everyone who's been here before

is humble enough

to take a picture with me.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] Yeah. Okay.

</line>


<line>
Sign me up for six weeks. Starting now.

</line>


<line>
-And a picture?

-Sure.

</line>


<line>
-Cheese!
