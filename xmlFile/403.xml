[classical music playing]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-He'll be here.

-But his part is in 16 bars.

</line>


<line>
[grunts and panting]

</line>


<line>
Excuse me. Sorry!

</line>


<line>
[groaning, panting]

</line>


<line>
[orchestra swells]

</line>


<line>
-[note dings]

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[cheers and applause]

</line>


<line>
I heard before he played triangle

he was in a prison gang.

</line>


<line>
I heard he was a tech millionaire.

</line>


<line>
[in French accent] There is a rumor

he is a foreign prince.

</line>


<line>
-His name is Todd Chavez.

-[gasping]

</line>


<line>
And he's the most giving man

the world has ever known.

</line>


<line>
He saved my pregnant daughter

from drowning in a shipwreck,

</line>


<line>
<ital>then he delivered her baby</ital>

<ital>while they rode on a piece of driftwood.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[musicians gasp]

<ital>-And then he circumcised her baby</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>while they both hung from the ladder</ital>

<ital>of the rescue helicopter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

<ital>-Of course, before he did,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Todd Chavez explained that circumcision</ital>

<ital>has somewhat fallen out of vogue.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>They had a spirited</ital>

<ital>but respectful debate,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and by the end my daughter decided</ital>

<ital>that since we are of Jewish heritage,</ital>

the boy might like to have the option

to become religious if he so chooses.

</line>


<line>
Sounds like he really helped your daughter

make the decision

that was right for her family.

</line>


<line>
And last year, when our triangle player

died of starvation

after getting his foot stuck

in his triangle,

</line>


<line>
Todd Chavez took over

because we needed him.

</line>


<line>
-What a guy!

-He is always helping others.

</line>


<line>
You know, sometimes

when that triangle part is coming up,

</line>


<line>
I find myself hoping he won't show up.

</line>


<line>
No man should be asked

to give that much.

</line>


<line>
-He is truly the best of all of--

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier

and I got salsa on my shirt.

</line>


<line>
I went to clean it off, but then when

I put my hands in the automatic dryer

</line>


<line>
I forgot I was still holding the taco.

</line>


<line>
I got my hands all greasy,

so I couldn't open the doorknob

for an hour.

</line>


<line>
What you guys talking about?

</line>


<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
[cell phone alarm music]

</line>


<line>
[Katrina] So then at 11:00 you're gonna be

giving a policy speech on fracking.

</line>


<line>
Fracktastic!

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, all this talk

of whatever it is you're talking about

</line>


<line>
-is making me hungry.

-Mmm?

</line>


<line>
Cheese? Yes, please!

</line>


<line>
Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter

with your weird pocket cheeses.

</line>


<line>
The issue is fracking and the people

really want to know your opinion.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, color me "the people"

because I would also like

to know my opinion.

</line>


<line>
You don't have one yet.

The polling research comes in today

</line>


<line>
and that will decide whether

you're for or against fracking.

</line>


<line>
Here's a thought:

maybe be against fracking.

</line>


<line>
-It's terrible!

-Diane.

</line>


<line>
Just my opinion.

You don't tell me how to do my job.

</line>


<line>
Also, fracking is the worst. I can't 

believe you'd even consider endorsing it.

</line>


<line>
None of my business.

Gotta get to work. Love you!

</line>


<line>
-Bye, hon!

-But seriously, seriously,

</line>


<line>
if you come out in support of fracking

I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!

</line>


<line>
Where you stand on the issue

doesn't really matter.

</line>


<line>
What's important is that

you seem sincere and emphatic.

</line>


<line>
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming

but inessential Will Smith movies?

</line>


<line>
Because, slight <ital>Hitch,</ital>

I always show I'm empathic

by taking off my glasses dramatically,

but I kinda lost them.

</line>


<line>
Wow! This must be what I'd look like

to a starving shipwrecked person.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] When did you last see the glasses?

</line>


<line>
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
She was saying

I'm always forgetting stuff,

so I whipped off my glasses,

looked her square in the eye and said,

</line>


<line>
"I never forget a thing."

</line>


<line>
I might have left my glasses there.

</line>


<line>
Todd, you never do anything.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you take the campaign bus

over to VIM

</line>


<line>
and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?

Can you handle that?

</line>


<line>
I never know if I can handle anything.

</line>


<line>
That's what makes my life so exciting.

</line>


<line>
-[both grunting]

-Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!

</line>


<line>
[Katrina] He's busy! Just sign for it.

</line>


<line>
I can't sign for another man's mail.

</line>


<line>
That's how I ended up with the cremains

of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

</line>


<line>
It all started when a young Todd--

[grunts] I don't have time for this!

</line>


<line>
I've got a job to do.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
-[Princess Carolyn] It's Todd!

-It's me!

</line>


<line>
You are just the guy I need.

You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

</line>


<line>
I think so. She portrayed the formerly 

portly consort in <ital>The Seaport Resort</ital>?

</line>


<line>
Courtly roles like

the formerly portly consort

are Courtney Portnoy's forte,

but she's got a new action movie

that's supposed to change her image:

<ital>Ms. Taken.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You know Mr. Taken

from the <ital>Taken </ital>movies?

</line>


<line>
-This is his niece.

-Nice!

</line>


<line>
This was supposed to be Courtney's 

crossover coronation.

</line>


<line>
But that's sort of been thwarted, 

unfortunately,

</line>


<line>
'cause Courtney's

purportedly falling short

of shoring up four-quadrant support.

</line>


<line>
Makes perfect sense so far.

</line>


<line>
The public sees her as out of touch.

</line>


<line>
We need to make her seem relatable,

and the best way to do that

is to be seen dating a down-to-earth

boring nobody like yourself.

</line>


<line>
You can do that, right?

You're not doing anything.

</line>


<line>
I'm kind of busy today.

I gotta pick up these glasses,

and then tonight there was this meeting

I wanted to go to.

</line>


<line>
This will take no time, I promise.

Meet her for lunch.

</line>


<line>
The paparazzi will show up,

pop some razzis.

</line>


<line>
I do love getting my picture taken.

It's proof I exist.

</line>


<line>
Marvelous!

Judah, prepare the press release.

</line>


<line>
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy."

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Well, we didn't get the polling research

on fracking--

</line>


<line>
-Here you go.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Because apparently when the delivery came

someone wouldn't sign for it.

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

</line>


<line>
In the future, whenever anyone asks you

to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,

</line>


<line>
-just sign it.

-You got it, chief.

</line>


<line>
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,

here's what you're gonna do.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna give

an impassioned speech on fracking

that doesn't actually take a stand

either way on fracking.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Good morning!

</line>


<line>
Let's talk fracking.

</line>


<line>
Everyone has very strong opinions

about it,

and I want you all to know,

right here and right now,

</line>


<line>
I am taking a stand.

</line>


<line>
-I am on... your side!

-[applause]

</line>


<line>
-What side is that, specifically?

-Good question.

</line>


<line>
I am specifically

on the side of the facts,

and also on the side of feelings.

</line>


<line>
-[cheers and applause]

-Well, I'm satisfied.

</line>


<line>
Oh, excuse me,

would Mr. Peanutbutter

be willing to sign this letter

to our state government?

</line>


<line>
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you so much.

</line>


<line>
[gasps] And down goes Todd.

</line>


<line>
And up comes Todd!

</line>


<line>
Aah! [grunting]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Stay back!

</line>


<line>
Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.

</line>


<line>
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim

Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag

</line>


<line>
-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

-Wait, wait, wait.

</line>


<line>
-What's your first name?

-Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
And your last name?

</line>


<line>
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson- 

Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

</line>


<line>
Got it.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what's your last name?

-I know, it's confusing.

</line>


<line>
-I have eight dads.

-How'd that happen? Test tubes?

</line>


<line>
-No. I was adopted.

-Oh, of course.

</line>


<line>
By eight men in a committed gay

polyamorous relationship.

</line>


<line>
-Less of course.

-But ever since I was a baby,

people always said I looked like

BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!

-[skimmer clatters]

</line>


<line>
And I've always wondered if BoJack

could be my biological... sperm guy.

</line>


<line>
I guess it's possible.

</line>


<line>
BoJack used to say his penis

is like sun-dried tomatoes:

back in the '90s it got into everything.

</line>


<line>
I came to L.A.

to get to the bottom of things.

</line>


<line>
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.

Sorry about knocking you out.

</line>


<line>
Once you have chloroform,

you can't <ital>not</ital> use it.

</line>


<line>
No, I get it. BoJack had one

of those spy kits, too.

</line>


<line>
He mostly just used the chloroform

on himself, though.

</line>


<line>
I read in his book that you live together.

</line>


<line>
-Can you help me find him?

-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

</line>


<line>
And no one knows where he's been

for the last year.

</line>


<line>
I guess I don't have to meet him.

</line>


<line>
All I need is a DNA sample,

like a piece of hair or something.

</line>


<line>
-I guess his house might have-- [gasps]

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Sorry again. It's just so fun.

</line>


<line>
Okay, there might be some hairs

in the shower drain,

but hard to know who they belong to.

</line>


<line>
Everyone who has sex with BoJack

usually takes a <ital>long </ital>shower afterwards.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, I think I see a hair.

-[moaning]

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-Yoink!

-What the... was...

</line>


<line>
-[exhales] Okay.

-Okay, let's blow.

</line>


<line>
Blow? Who's got blow?

Save some for BoJack. [groans] Huh?

</line>


<line>
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna

yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

</line>


<line>
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?

And I'm not going to yell at you.

</line>


<line>
And what is this?

</line>


<line>
I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim- 

Guerrero-Robinson-

</line>


<line>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

</line>


<line>
Of the New Haven 

Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

</line>


<line>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?

</line>


<line>
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never

heard of your family and/or law firm.

</line>


<line>
That was also a joke. Todd, who is

this tough crowd you brought to my home?

</line>


<line>
-Um, BoJack, this is your daught...

-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

</line>


<line>
...dot-dot maid.

</line>


<line>
Way to build up the suspense.

</line>


<line>
To, uh, tidy up the place

in case you came back.

</line>


<line>
You got me a maid? Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Here I thought Channing Tatum

was a good neighbor

for picking up my mail while I was gone,

but you, and after all the things

I did to you,

</line>


<line>
-I don't know how to tell you--

-BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,

and that's actually been

kind of working for me.

</line>


<line>
So, maybe it's better if we just

keep things like that, you know?

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

</line>


<line>
You're welcome.

Now go get that DNA tested.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Can you tell me if this is a match?

</line>


<line>
-A match with who?

-Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub

Zoolander-Hallelujah-something-McDonald's?

</line>


<line>
Whatever those words are,

I need a sample from her, too.

</line>


<line>
[groans] Duh!

</line>


<line>
Bring it in an hour.

I gotta get to lunch.

</line>


<line>
Nothing like working

with hair, blood, and semen all day

to work up an appetite,

and it's already 1:00.

</line>


<line>
1:00?

I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!

</line>


<line>
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?

</line>


<line>
Mine is a bunch of water balloons

with a blonde wig.

</line>


<line>
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this

is too fancy for a common man

such as yourself.

</line>


<line>
No, it's fine.

</line>


<line>
You'd probably like to take me

someplace rough and primitive.

</line>


<line>
Uh... do you want me to take you

somewhere else?

</line>


<line>
Well, if you must drag me on some

barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.

</line>


<line>
There's a Pony Roma's

at Universal CityWalk.

</line>


<line>
A chain restaurant?

Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.

</line>


<line>
I can't do this.

</line>


<line>
Todd, I can never be

your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
-I must abscond. [sobs]

-Wait, Courtney!

</line>


<line>
-[cameras clicking]

-[tires screeching]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Scusi, </ital>sir, would you care

for a sample

of my father's famous

angel hair pomodoro?

</line>


<line>
Famous father? Hair? Sample?

</line>


<line>
-DNA?

-I no say DNA.

</line>


<line>
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
[grunting and panting]

</line>


<line>
-[door opens]

-Hollyhock, I need to get--

</line>


<line>
-Did you clean anything?

-No.

</line>


<line>
But I am learning so much

about my possibly-maybe birth father.

</line>


<line>
Like, did you know he has a shoebox

in his closet full of bad reviews

for other people's TV shows?

</line>


<line>
So all you've done so far

is snoop around?

</line>


<line>
I also ate a box of donuts,

got sleepy and took a nap.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need

to do this DNA test.

</line>


<line>
Look, I didn't come all this way

to not find out

who my biological father is.

</line>


<line>
Okay, fine, then I just need you

to yank out a strand of hair

</line>


<line>
-so I can take it down to the lab.

-No way! That sounds painful.

</line>


<line>
-Can't we just use your hair?

-Um...

</line>


<line>
-No.

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
No, but I can pull out some of my hair

at the same time,

</line>


<line>
-so you don't have to do it alone.

-Okay, that sounds fair.

</line>


<line>
On three, we pull.

</line>


<line>
-One... two... three!

-Ow!

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait, I have this whole comb

full of hair in my bag.

</line>


<line>
-Duh!

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Todd, can I see you for a minute?

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
This maid is the worst.

I passed out again for some reason.

</line>


<line>
When I woke up, the house

was messier than when she started.

</line>


<line>
I don't mind someone else

in the house with me,

in case I start choking on pills

or have a funny take on current events

that demands an audience, but if she

can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

</line>


<line>
You can't do that!

Here, buzz up real nice,

take a nap, and while you're sleeping,

I'll get the maid to clean

so no one has to fire anyone.

</line>


<line>
[snoring]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, we did it.

</line>


<line>
What? I'm helping.

I'm cleaning out his DVR. Get it?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, but you got it, right?

-[groans]

<line>
Todd's phone, home of the Todd.

</line>


<line>
You quarter-wit.

Turn on the news.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to be a manners police,

but a "hello" would be nice.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The letter, signed by</ital>

<ital>Mr. Peanutbutter himself,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-in full, unambiguous support of fracking.</ital>

-Ooh.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The gubernatorial hopeful</ital>

<ital>has until now played coy</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>on the controversial issue of fra...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>What happened?</ital>

<ital>Randy pass out on his keyboard?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Oh, he did? Oh, my God, is he okay?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, did someone call Cynthia?</ital>

<ital>No one called Cynthia?!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>For Christ's sake, this isn't just</ital>

<ital>a newsroom, this is a family!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Jeez, I hope Randy's okay.

</line>


<line>
Forget Randy. Did you sign that letter

for Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Yes. Should I have not done the thing

you literally told me to do?

</line>


<line>
Well, I guess we're pro-fracking now.

</line>


<line>
[muffled yelling]

</line>


<line>
Hey, buddy, I just want you to know

that while Katrina is filled

with white-hot frustration

as she has been for much of this campaign,

I'm not mad.

</line>


<line>
I'm just nervous about

what Diane will do when she finds out.

</line>


<line>
But I've got a plan, and it stars you!

</line>


<line>
What? You want me to keep Diane away

from the TV, radio, and Internet?

</line>


<line>
Ohh! That's a way better idea than I had.

Yeah, do that.

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock, I gotta run.

</line>


<line>
I'll try to get the hairs tested today.

Just stay here and act maid-like.

</line>


<line>
-[moaning]

-Ah, okay.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Hey, look at me! I'm dancing.

The time is now! Don't miss out!

</line>


<line>
Okay, Todd, that's some good dancing,

but I've got work to do

and you've been dancing for...

55 minutes?!

</line>


<line>
-What is this?

-It's a new dance.

</line>


<line>
I call it the... come on, stall, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Gotta think of something to call

this fake dance you just made up.

</line>


<line>
Samba.

</line>


<line>
That's amazing, and you're amazing,

and I want your pores.

</line>


<line>
Diane, I adored your sad little story

on refugees.

</line>


<line>
We have so many articles

about things people care about.

</line>


<line>
It's like supes refreshing to see

something that doesn't make you click,

but it does make you think.

</line>


<line>
Well, it's not like nobody

clicks on my articles.

</line>


<line>
You don't care if people read your work

or not. That's what's so brave about you.

</line>


<line>
You inspire me to be my fiercest self.

</line>


<line>
Buh-buh-buh-bye!

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
Todd's phone.

I know when that Toddline bling.

</line>


<line>
What happened at the restaurant?

</line>


<line>
You disappeared before the paparazzi

even got there.

</line>


<line>
The whole point

was to get a picture with her.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Oops.

</line>


<line>
Uh, you want me to draw a picture

from memory?

</line>


<line>
How tall is she?

What is she, like, eight feet?

</line>


<line>
Okay, plan B.

</line>


<line>
She's gonna be at the Sharc Jacobs

fashion show in 30 minutes.

</line>


<line>
There's an empty seat there

for her boyfriend, you.

</line>


<line>
Be there, get the photo. Got it?

Click.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
So, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
How do I make people care

about important stuff

when all they want to do is read articles

about who got slayed

and who owned at the VMAs?

</line>


<line>
When I need Mr. Peanutbutter

to take his heartworm pills,

</line>


<line>
I always hide it in cheese

so he doesn't know

he's doing something he hates.

</line>


<line>
What if you take your important stuff

and hide it in some juicy gossip?

</line>


<line>
That's actually a really good idea.

</line>


<line>
But... [groans] I don't know any gossip

and I wouldn't even know where to look.

</line>


<line>
The Internet?

</line>


<line>
No! Look at me!

</line>


<line>
Because I have potentially 

earth-shattering inside info!

</line>


<line>
That beloved famous person, uh...

</line>


<line>
Channing Tatum may have

an illegitimate daughter

that's also a Cordovian refugee.

</line>


<line>
-Are you serious?

-I have these two hairs.

</line>


<line>
One is from Channing,

the other is from a baby.

</line>


<line>
If the DNA lab confirms a match,

you have your story.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, Todd. I owe you one.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but if it's a match,

please call me first.

</line>


<line>
'Cause, uh-- 'cause I love juicy gossip.

</line>


<line>
[ringing]

</line>


<line>
Where am I supposed to go?

Okay.

</line>


<line>
"<ital>El</ital> Entrance?"

</line>

<ital>Gracias, sign. Muy bien.</ital>

-Um...

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-Good heavens! What's this?

</line>


<line>
[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Uh... okay.

</line>


<line>
-[dance music playing]

-[mutters] And this is how I walk...

</line>


<line>
He's so normal.

</line>


<line>
Uh... hmm... uh...

</line>


<line>
Where's the hollow look of someone

forced to starve themselves

to fit our unrealistic expectation

of what beauty should be?

</line>


<line>
[Tim Gunn] He is not making it work.

</line>


<line>
-No! Wait!

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
Isn't fashion supposed to be for everyone?

</line>


<line>
That behatted boy is right.

</line>


<line>
Fashion was never meant to be

an inherently elitist form.

</line>


<line>
We need to return fashion

to its utilitarian roots.

</line>


<line>
Give it back to the people!

</line>


<line>
-[Gunn] Bravo! He <ital>is </ital>making it work.

-[applause]

</line>


<line>
[ringtone]

<ital><music>♪ To-To-To-Todd! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Todd's phone.

Leave a message at the Todd.

</line>


<line>
The DNA matched!

</line>


<line>
Looks like a wide variety of screen roles

isn't the only thing

Channing brought life to.

</line>


<line>
It's a match?

I gotta tell Holly... woo agents

to keep their eyes peeled

for a refugee baby

with abs to die for.

[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Nick, tell Janae to stock the warehouse

with red hoodies.

</line>


<line>
-This is the look of the future.

-Couch-surfer couture!

</line>


<line>
[ringing]

</line>


<line>
Where's Hollyhock?

I need to talk to her.

</line>


<line>
-She's in maid heaven.

-She's dead?!

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I meant she belongs in maid heaven

because she is a cleaning angel.

</line>


<line>
-Where is she?

-I sent her to Channing Tatum's house

to pay him back for collecting my mail

while I was out of town.

</line>


<line>
Looks like I missed quite a deal

at Pottery Barn.

</line>


<line>
Life is but an endless series

of missed opportunities,

some involving Pottery Barn.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm gonna--

</line>


<line>
Can you believe this?

Mr. Peanutbutter's running for governor.

</line>


<line>
I can believe it, because I've been around

for the last year.

</line>


<line>
Right. How's Diane feel about that?

</line>


<line>
You could ask her yourself.

Does she even know you're back?

</line>


<line>
I wanted to call her,

but I'm just not ready.

</line>


<line>
Nobody knows I'm back except you.

</line>


<line>
And Channing Tatum, and my pills guy,

and my booze guy,

my weed guy, my coke guy,

some smartass at Pizza Hut

who deserved an in-person finger-wagging,

</line>


<line>
-and my maid.

-And now she's at Channing Tatum's house?

</line>


<line>
I came back because

I wanted to fix things,

</line>


<line>
-but now I don't know if I can.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
I've been so lucky to have people

in my life who care about me.

</line>


<line>
I don't deserve any of them.

</line>


<line>
I definitely don't deserve

to have a friend as amazing

and generous and forgiving

and thoughtful as...

</line>


<line>
-Yeah? Oh.

-Channing Tatum.

</line>


<line>
I'm only gonna hurt him

like I've hurt everyone else.

</line>


<line>
I was a fool to think I could just

jump back into a new relationship.

</line>


<line>
Can you go over to Channing Tatum's house,

tell him I won't be his friend?

</line>


<line>
I can't break another heart.

Not today, not Channing.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock, I need to tell you something.

-Did you get the results?

</line>


<line>
'Cause I'm really looking forward

to dropping this whole maid thing,

even though I'm kind of nailing it.

</line>


<line>
Are you sure you want to know?

I don't know if BoJack is ready

for a normal relationship with anyone.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's fine.

I don't want a relationship.

</line>


<line>
I already have eight dads.

</line>


<line>
It's not like a ninth dad is what I need

to suddenly fill a hole in my life

that the unconditional love of eight dads

couldn't already fill.

</line>


<line>
Well, then good news.

</line>


<line>
I got the results and...

it's not a match.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Really?

-Yeah. Good news, right?

</line>


<line>
I shouldn't have come here.

</line>


<line>
Papa Steve told me this was a bad idea.

</line>


<line>
But Papa Greg said, "Follow your heart."

</line>


<line>
Then Papa Dashawn said,

"I agree with Greg."

</line>


<line>
Daddy Quackers said,

"Let's put it to a vote, quack-quack."

</line>


<line>
[knock on door]

</line>


<line>
-[Diane] Hello? Anybody home?

-Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] I can hear someone in there.

<span style="style_3"/>Channing?

</line>


<line>
Jenna Dewan?

Their daughter, Everly Elizabeth?

</line>


<line>
Uh, it's me... [deep breath]

Channing Tatum.

</line>


<line>
I'm in the middle of, uh,

channing right now,

but you can come back... tatum?

</line>


<line>
Listen, I'm a reporter.

</line>


<line>
I tested your DNA

against another sample's DNA,

and apparently the two are related.

</line>


<line>
-You're a father.

-Wait, what?

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Thanks!

-Todd.

</line>


<line>
I was going to write a story

and drag your name through the mud

just because I thought a couple more

people would click on an article I wrote.

</line>


<line>
But I don't think that's

the kind of journalist I want to be.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I'm not cut out

for this line of work.

</line>


<line>
Sorry to bother you.

</line>


<line>
Uh... [deep breath]

</line>


<line>
[in lower voice] Hey, I obviously don't

know you because I am Channing Tatum,

the guy from <ital>Green Lantern</ital>

or whatever,

and you are a nobody,

but you came all the way over here

to warn me about something

you hadn't even written yet.

</line>


<line>
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

</line>


<line>
I'd say you're exactly the kind

of journalist we need in this world.

</line>


<line>
Wow!

</line>


<line>
That doesn't sound at all

like Channing Tatum's voice,

but that <ital>is </ital>the kind of thing I would want

Channing Tatum to say to me,

so thanks, Channing.

</line>


<line>
Love half your movies!

</line>


<line>
[sighs] That was a close one,

huh, Hollyhock?

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock?

-[ringtone] <ital><music>♪ To-To-To-Todd! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Todd's phone. What do you want?

</line>


<line>
So, I see lots of pictures of you

at the fashion show,

</line>


<line>
-but none of you with Courtney.

-Oh, crap!

</line>


<line>
[grunting, panting]

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Oh, hello.

</line>


<line>
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

</line>


<line>
These aren't anything like your clothes.

This hat alone cost $50,000.

</line>


<line>
Oh. So, uh...

what's it like being a movie star?

</line>


<line>
It's awfully trying.

</line>


<line>
Do you ever feel like

everyone's looking at you

</line>


<line>
-but nobody sees you?

-Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

</line>


<line>
No, I was speaking rhetorically

about a feeling that only movie stars get.

</line>


<line>
Ohh.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-But it feels good to talk about it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Talking's good.

</line>


<line>
You know, there was a meeting

I was supposed to go to tonight,

but I don't think I'm gonna go.

I don't know if I'm ready.

</line>


<line>
Ready for what?

</line>


<line>
What if it's not everything

I want it to be?

</line>


<line>
Sometimes the idea of something

is better than the truth, you know?

</line>


<line>
I always prefer fiction to truth, 

personally.

</line>


<line>
I've staked my career on it.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that makes sense.

</line>


<line>
-Ha hah!

-Smile for the birdie.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling

with a supermodel now?

</line>


<line>
-That's right.

-Fancy.

</line>


<line>
I love how not down-to-earth

you are together.

</line>


<line>
This is going to really make headlines

when you two break up.

</line>


<line>
Here's an even bigger headline:

we shan't be breaking up.

</line>


<line>
-We're engaged!

-Wowee!

</line>


<line>
Hooray! I'm confused!

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock? Are you here?

</line>


<line>
No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock is your daughter.

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
-She's your daughter.

-I don't understand.

</line>


<line>
She has Horseman DNA.

You're her father.

</line>


<line>
That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

</line>


<line>
She didn't want me to tell you,

but I thought you should know.

</line>


<line>
I guess I don't blame her.

I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

</line>


<line>
BoJack...

</line>


<line>
Look what I do to people

I'm supposed to care about.

</line>


<line>
I had sex with the one person

I've ever seen you be in love with.

</line>


<line>
I guess they're not gonna put you

in the best friends hall of fame,

but I don't know that I loved her.

</line>


<line>
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

</line>


<line>
Don't say that.

You do so much for everybody.

</line>


<line>
All you ever asked for

was a roof over your head

and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you,

it's a million-dollar idea.

</line>


<line>
I got more of you than I ever deserved.

</line>


<line>
If you never talk to me again

I just want you to know

that I appreciate it,

and I appreciate you.

</line>


<line>
-Thanks.

-[sipping]

</line>


<line>
It was shitty

what you did with Emily, but, um...

</line>


<line>
I think I'm... asexual.

</line>


<line>
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?

</line>


<line>
Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?

</line>


<line>
No. Asexual, not sexual.

</line>


<line>
Ohh.

</line>


<line>
-I'm sure you think that's weird.

-Are you kidding? That's amazing.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

</line>


<line>
Maybe then I wouldn't have

<ital>a </ital>strain of herpes.

</line>


<line>
-You have multiple strains--

-I know.

</line>


<line>
The joke only works with the "a".

</line>


<line>
It actually feels nice

to finally say it out loud.

</line>


<line>
I am an asexual person.

</line>


<line>
-I am asexual.

-That's great.

</line>


<line>
So if you're not mad about Emily--

</line>


<line>
It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,

and I don't know if I'm ready for us

to be friends again yet.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Okay.

-But we can be more than not-friends.

</line>


<line>
You know, for an asexual,

more than not-friends is probably

as good as it gets, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm not really at a place yet

where I want to joke about it.

</line>


<line>
-Got it, got it, totally.

-But it feels good to talk about it.

</line>


<line>
Well, if you ever need a place to crash,

that couch--

</line>


<line>
-I'm gonna go.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Right now?

-Welcome back, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
It's good to see you.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
