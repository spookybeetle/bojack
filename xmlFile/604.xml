<line>
-[whirring]

<ital>-Dad! I'm shooting a video!</ital>

</line>


<line>
[Franco] <ital>Demi!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I really thought me and Buzzy</ital>

<ital>were built to last,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>like Brad and Angelina,</ital>

<ital>or Gwyneth and Coldplay Man,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>or America and its current love affair</ital>

<ital>with Rebel Wilson.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[sighs] <ital>I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking</ital>

<ital>about my personal life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I just feel so alone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[icon pops]

<ital>-Aw! Thank you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Hey, Pickle Pack!</ital>

<ital>Gettin' ready for another job interview.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I think I'm just gonna lie</ital>

<ital>about having experience. Right?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I got the job! I'm a systems analyst?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I got fired my first day</ital>

<ital>as a systems analyst,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but then I got a job</ital>

<ital>as an air traffic controller!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I got fired my first day</ital>

<ital>as an air traffic controller.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But then I got a job as a waitress!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-So, I've been seeing someone.</ital>

-[icon pops]

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's a yellow lab,</ital>

<ital>and he's so handsome and friendly.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[barks and licks]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Mister asked me to move in with him!</ital>

-[icons pop]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Hi, Mister!</ital>

<ital>-Oh, are you taking a video? </ital>[laughs]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Thank you, queefburglar69,</ital>

<ital>for that lovely cartoon heart!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Get a load of this cool house,</ital>

<ital>Pickle Pack! Lights, off. Lights, on!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[giggles]

<ital>-Thank you, Robot House!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Check this out. The Thunder Room.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>A place to wait out thunderstorms</ital>

<ital>and Fourth of July celebrations!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Thunder door, close!</ital>

</line>


<line>
[automated voice] <ital>Closing. </ital>[clunks] 

<ital>Thunder Room secure.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Cute!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He got down on one knee and everything!</ital>

<ital>He was so nervous before he asked!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Of course I said yes!</ital>

-[icons pop]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I think Mister is still in shock!</ital>

<ital>-Engaged! That's what we are now!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ring filter!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, I guess I liked the play.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was just surprised at how different</ital>

<ital>it was from the movie.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I kept waiting for the baseball part.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And so many dysfunctional relationships!</ital>

<ital>All the cheating and lying!</ital>

</line>


<line>
[sighs] <ital>I'm sure glad we're not like that,</ital>

<ital>right, Mister?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Um, Pickles, would you mind</ital>

<ital>turning off the livestream?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>There's something I need</ital>

<ital>to discuss with you. Privately.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ooh, I hope it's something good!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[beeps]

-[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-The wedding is off!</ital> [crying]

-[icons popping]

</line>


<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
-[brakes squeak]

-[crickets chirping]

</line>


<line>
[exhales]

</line>


<line>
Hi, I'm here to see BoJack.

</line>


<line>
You're... [sucks teeth]

</line>


<line>
...too late.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-He's... [sucks teeth]

</line>


<line>
...gone...

</line>


<line>
-No!

-...to a party for the night.

</line>


<line>
Here's the address.

Sorry for all the wincing.

</line>


<line>
I put too many jalapeños

on my... [sucks teeth]

</line>


<line>
...sandwich.

</line>


<line>
A party? With alcohol?

</line>


<line>
No, a lame party, without alcohol.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Don't worry. We sent him

with a trained sober companion.

</line>


<line>
He'll keep him out of trouble.

</line>


<line>
This is Eduardo.

He's here to keep me out of trouble.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles] Say, aren't you

one of those fainting goats?

</line>


<line>
[laughs] Only if I panic.

</line>


<line>
So, what makes you panic?

</line>


<line>
Nothing. The whole point is

he doesn't panic. Sober companion.

</line>


<line>
You know what makes me panic?

</line>


<line>
Most of the time

I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,

but sometimes I like to dwell

on the fact that

there will always be invisible walls

between myself and those who claim

to know me.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles] That sure is nerve-racking,

but the only thing that makes me panic

is the thought

that I might someday drink again.

</line>


<line>
-A toast to that never happening!

-[whimpers and thuds]

</line>


<line>
Very helpful. Thank you, Eduardo.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr. Peanutbutter 

met at a gas station once.

</line>


<line>
I honestly don't even know

why I got invited to this party.

</line>


<line>
[Ruthie crying]

</line>


<line>
You know, I got a few TV ideas myself.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles] Franco, nobody wants to hear

your time-travelling orthodontist pitch!

</line>


<line>
Demi, you are lighting a long fuse

on a short stick of dynamite.

</line>


<line>
Oh, whoop. And a big one at that.

</line>


<line>
[inhales, exhales]

</line>


<line>
-Diane! Didn't think I'd see you here!

-[screams]

</line>


<line>
Could you go tell BoJack to come out

so I can talk to him?

</line>


<line>
What? I don't have time

for your classic Diane wackiness.

</line>


<line>
We gotta get these to the balloon room!

</line>


<line>
-[coos]

-[screams]

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey, look who's back in town!

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-Wow! Baby! Cute!

</line>


<line>
-[giggling]

-She's crawling all over the place.

</line>


<line>
I wasn't gonna bring her out,

but another nanny quit on me.

</line>


<line>
Carlotta quit, huh?

</line>


<line>
I assume she resigned in disgrace

</line>


<line>
for not making good airplane noises

when she feeds Ruthie?

</line>


<line>
No, she said she felt

she was being watched all day.

</line>


<line>
Impossible! I'm there around the clock,

observing her every move.

</line>


<line>
-If she was being watched, I'd know!

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Uh, where do these balloons go?

</line>


<line>
Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.

</line>


<line>
Pickles' other friend Ilana.

Didn't think I'd see you here.

</line>


<line>
And then of course, there's always

the looming fear

my spleen could up and re-twist itself.

</line>


<line>
How are we back in a conversation?

</line>


<line>
It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea,

but the current keeps washing me back

to the same shallow backwater.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, there you are.

-Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.

</line>


<line>
-Never leave my side.

-I have to tell you--

</line>


<line>
-Okay, everybody get to your places!

-What's happening?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter's and Pickles'

surprise wedding!

</line>


<line>
Surprise wedding?

</line>


<line>
The wedding planning

was stressing Mr. Peanutbutter out,

and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.

</line>


<line>
And I'm not doing much

except for sitting at home

watching Princess Carolyn's

terrible nannies,

so naturally, I thought,

"Ooh! Surprise wedding!"

</line>


<line>
-Where are they now?

-I got them two tickets

to <ital>Angels in the Outfield.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-The movie?

-The play. It's like six hours long.

</line>


<line>
Do you mean <ital>Angels in America?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is,

after that feel-good comedy,

they'll be in a great mood for a wedding!

</line>


<line>
Wow. Okay...

</line>


<line>
Look, I cannot be here.

Just... I'm moving.

</line>


<line>
Great, your apartment's a dump.

Where are you moving to?

</line>


<line>
Uh, not Echo Park. I'll never see you.

</line>


<line>
-Chicago.

-Chicago? <ital>Chicago</ital> Chicago?

</line>


<line>
Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway!

</line>


<line>
-Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

-Why Chicago?

</line>


<line>
Everybody hide and stay quiet.

</line>


<line>
[slapping and groaning]

</line>


<line>
Remember, as soon as the lights go on,

just jump up and yell, "Surprise!"

</line>


<line>
-Lights, off!

-[lights beep]

</line>


<line>
Um, Pickles? Would you mind

turning off the livestream?

</line>


<line>
There's something I need

to discuss with you. Privately.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

</line>


<line>
It's not.

</line>


<line>
-Lights--

-Wait!

</line>


<line>
Before Robot House assaults us

with the harsh, unforgiving glare

of our energy-efficient bulbs,

</line>


<line>
I need to tell you this.

</line>


<line>
But it's so dark in here.

</line>


<line>
What I'm about to confess is so shameful,

</line>


<line>
I can only admit it

in the cover of shadow.

</line>


<line>
Don't be silly. Lights, on!

</line>


<line>
-I cheated on you!

-[man] Surp--!

</line>


<line>
-[man shushes]

-Did someone just say something?

</line>


<line>
Don't change the subject!

</line>


<line>
-[voice breaking] You cheated on me?

-I am so sorry.

</line>


<line>
-How could you do this?

-It was the worst mistake of my life!

</line>


<line>
And I once played Twister

with Bryan Singer

at Kevin Spacey's party

for Andy Dick's early parole.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-I've been in the Thunder Room every night

for months trying to swallow my shame.

</line>


<line>
But I can't. And I've apparently been

so racked with guilt I left the door open.

</line>


<line>
-Thunder door, close.

-[automated voice] <ital>Closing. </ital>[clunks]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Thunder Room secure.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[muffled voice] Help! Please!

</line>


<line>
Just because you feel guilty,

that doesn't make it okay.

</line>


<line>
Are you the time I went to see

Lady Gaga in concert

and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?

</line>


<line>
Because I am hurt,

and I am confused, and I am angry,

and nobody told me there was going to be

an encore, so I just went home and...

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-Why am I even talking to you?

</line>


<line>
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
But, honestly,

can Ilana even relate to me anymore?

</line>


<line>
Since she got that

new Sunday-to-Thursday job

she's turned into a real

see-you-next-Friday.

</line>


<line>
I never thought I'd say this,

but sometimes I feel like I prefer

my other friend Ilana.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes it's just easier to talk

to a person who has nothing else going on.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.

I'm a Gemini.

</line>


<line>
No! Think of my family!

They need me to be strong right now.

</line>


<line>
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
He recently confided to me

he feels trapped in a loveless marriage

with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
-[laughs awkwardly]

-Well, can you blame her?

</line>


<line>
Excuse me?

</line>


<line>
Every time I get trapped

in a conversation with Captain,

</line>


<line>
I think, "If I was married to this guy,

</line>


<line>
I would gnaw my own hand off

just to get the ring off my body."

</line>


<line>
At least no one in my family

has anger issues.

</line>


<line>
My father has come so far

with his anger management classes!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, but your father is a hothead

with a little-pug complex.

</line>


<line>
-Everyone makes excuses for his outbursts.

-[snarling]

</line>


<line>
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.

</line>


<line>
-He's not usually like that."

-[shushes]

</line>


<line>
-Trust me. He's like that.

-How dare you.

</line>


<line>
And the way your mother provokes him!

I think they get off on it,

and they're making us unwilling

participants in their kinky foreplay.

</line>


<line>
Ew! Those are my parents!

</line>


<line>
-And don't even get me started on Greg.

-[shushes]

</line>


<line>
That guy that I met once

at that gas station!

</line>


<line>
-Why are you bringing him up?

-I don't know, but he sucks, too!

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-There, I got it off my chest.

</line>


<line>
I know who I need right now.

</line>


<line>
No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.

</line>


<line>
I understand your Pickle Pack

is part of how you process pain.

</line>


<line>
Wrong, Mr. Mister.

The Pack isn't part of anything.

</line>


<line>
They are everything.

</line>


<line>
When I stabbed myself in the eye

with a boba straw,

they all sent me photos

of themselves wearing eyepatches.

</line>


<line>
And when my Grandma Piccolino died,

stickyvicki was the first person

to say, "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

</line>


<line>
My subscribers are with me

through thick and thin.

</line>


<line>
And they have never strayed. Unsubscribe!

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
[Diane grunts]

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-I never thought this would have

so much practical application in my life,

but you could tie some sheets together

and make a rope.

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles, wait!

-[Pickles] No! You stay!

</line>


<line>
Bedroom lights, on!

</line>


<line>
-Down!

-[whispers] Go, go, go.

</line>


<line>
-[crying]

-[BoJack grunts]

</line>


<line>
[crying, groaning]

</line>


<line>
The wedding is off!

</line>


<line>
[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
He cheated on me!

</line>


<line>
-[wailing]

-[both groaning]

</line>


<line>
-Freezer, ice.

-[automated voice] <ital>Dispensing.</ital>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
-[pouring]

-[Pickles sobbing]

</line>


<line>
Oh, I have to talk to her! [pants]

</line>


<line>
[clamoring]

</line>


<line>
-[man] Go, go, go, go, go!

-Let's hit the bricks and quick.

</line>


<line>
-Um, Princess Carolyn...

-Oh, fish!

</line>


<line>
I mean, I've been hurt by guys before.

But this... I just feel so stupid.

</line>


<line>
-[text pops]

-My God, thank you, not even.

</line>


<line>
[knocks]

Hi. I know you are quite upset, but--

</line>


<line>
Are you not listening?

I told you to leave me alone.

</line>


<line>
-Right, but--

-Oh! You want a makeup tutorial?

</line>


<line>
Here's a makeup tutorial:

we are never making up!

</line>


<line>
-Wha--

-Door, slam!

</line>


<line>
Okay. Here's how to look

like a crying, pugly freak!

</line>


<line>
[Pickles] <ital>So, you're gonna want a mascara</ital>

<ital>that really runs...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-So, why Chicago?

-What?

</line>


<line>
What's the draw?

Is it the rampant gun violence?

</line>


<line>
Or do you just like seeing improv actors

who aren't good enough for LA?

</line>


<line>
-Or is there a guy?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
What's his name, your suitor?

Your gentleman caller?

</line>


<line>
-Guy.

-Fine. What's your guy's name?

</line>


<line>
No. Guy is the name of the guy

I'm not moving to Chicago for.

</line>


<line>
What's the name of the guy

you are moving to Chicago for?

</line>


<line>
I think we're done here.

</line>


<line>
[cooing]

</line>


<line>
-Ruthie.

-This is all your fault.

</line>


<line>
If you hadn't creeped out

every nanny I hire--

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't have to monitor them so closely

if you hadn't hired a bunch of quacks!

</line>


<line>
Ooh! Duck! [grunts]

</line>


<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter whimpering]

</line>


<line>
What's with all this mid-century furniture

so close to the ground?

</line>


<line>
-No one had to hide in the '50s?

-Close to the ground, that's it!

</line>


<line>
We've gotta think like a baby!

</line>


<line>
I'm a baby. I don't have a job.

</line>


<line>
I love being wrapped up

in soft, red hoodies.

</line>


<line>
And when I'm feeling low,

I like to get high.

</line>


<line>
[gasps] Ruthie's a climber!

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Just as I suspected.

</line>


<line>
[licks] Fresh drool. It's Ruthie.

</line>


<line>
Todd!

</line>


<line>
-[coos]

-[BoJack grunts]

</line>


<line>
[sighs] So, I obviously can't

marry him, right?

</line>


<line>
What do you guys think I should do?

</line>


<line>
-Hey. Give me that.

-[text pops]

</line>


<line>
"You should make Mr. Peanutbutter

take you to the park,

far away from this mouse."

What mouse?

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
-[text pops]

-Great idea!

</line>


<line>
-Door, open!

-[both gasp]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Mister! Take me to the park!

-[giggling]

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Can do!

-I'll be right down!

</line>


<line>
Okay, Pickle Pack,

let's pick out an outfit.

</line>


<line>
What says, "I am going to survive this

because I am strong,

</line>


<line>
-but you should still feel very bad"?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.

-[giggles]

</line>


<line>
But what if we go for a walk, and he says

all the right things, and I forgive him?

</line>


<line>
I can't make it so easy for him, can I?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>


<line>
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Mister!

Cancel the park and come here.

</line>


<line>
What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz!

</line>


<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] On my way, darling!

-Kitty up. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
-[Ruthie blows]

-[Princess Carolyn sighs]

</line>


<line>
Bring me my favorite drink.

Exactly the way I like it.

</line>


<line>
Then we'll talk.

</line>


<line>
Of course, right away!

</line>


<line>
[BoJack grunts]

</line>


<line>
[groans] Of course he'll make

my drink perfect.

</line>


<line>
Because he's perfect!

</line>


<line>
I mean, look at him!

</line>


<line>
And... and... Look at him!

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack groaning]

-Um... Oh!

</line>


<line>
And him, as portrayed

in this boardwalk caricature drawing!

</line>


<line>
I didn't know he liked tennis

and skateboarding.

</line>


<line>
What else has he been hiding from me?

</line>


<line>
[sighs] I mean, is it me?

Was I not good enough?

</line>


<line>
[text popping]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not the problem!

</line>


<line>
In fact, why am I even in his house?

</line>


<line>
-[text pops]

-I need to pack!

</line>


<line>
[groans] I'm going

to a fancy-ass hotel.

</line>


<line>
-And...

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
...I'm gonna try to get my room comped

in exchange for social media promotion!

</line>


<line>
And then they'll say no.

</line>


<line>
And then I'll pay for the room

and drag them online.

</line>


<line>
Hate to leave you hanging. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
-[coos]

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Wait a minute! Why should I leave?

</line>


<line>
-He's the one who cheated!

-[exhales]

</line>


<line>
[grunting]

</line>


<line>
He can live in the dog park

for all I care!

</line>


<line>
[text popping]

</line>


<line>
-[rustling]

-[Princess Carolyn groans]

</line>


<line>
But then, why do I want him to stay?

</line>


<line>
-I'm so confused.

-[text pops]

</line>


<line>
Good call, t_chavez!

</line>


<line>
-[notification dings]

-You're welcome. Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-Phew!

</line>


<line>
Boba Maker. Uh... boba make?

</line>


<line>
[whirs and squirts]

</line>


<line>
[automated voice]

<ital>Would you like whipped cream?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, so, uh, sobriety. How is it?

</line>


<line>
[scoffs] Impossible.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
There's no clear path to the exit.

You can wait it out, I'm doing the window.

</line>


<line>
It's not because of me

that you're moving to Chicago?

</line>


<line>
No. I need to go.

</line>


<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles? Precious?

Possible point of complexity...

</line>


<line>
Son of a bitch.

</line>


<line>
[grunting]

</line>


<line>
...I know your favorite drink is boba,

but just the other day, you said,

</line>


<line>
"Whipped cream

is the best thing in the world,"

immediately followed by,

and this is a direct quote,

</line>


<line>
"So, keep it as far away

from me as possible!"

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to circle back.

</line>


<line>
[music playing over earbuds]

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Don't get me wrong,

</line>


<line>
I love the challenge of trying

to square two irreconcilable positions.

</line>


<line>
-Where's the baby? There's the baby!

-[giggling]

</line>


<line>
Where's the baby?

[gasps] Shit! Where's the baby?

</line>


<line>
[glass shatters]

</line>


<line>
Bang-crash, you say! I hear the note.

</line>


<line>
I'll be right back with your drink

prepared exactly the way you want it!

</line>


<line>
[Princess Carolyn grunts]

</line>


<line>
Here.

</line>


<line>
-You know how in AA they give you chips?

-But no salsa?

</line>


<line>
Using that.

</line>


<line>
But they're a big deal, the chips.

</line>


<line>
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking

they're more important than they are,

but when I got my two-month chip...

</line>


<line>
I thought, "I wish Diane could see this."

</line>


<line>
I see it. It's amazing.

</line>


<line>
It would not be improved by salsa.

</line>


<line>
[Pickles] Door, open!

</line>


<line>
[both gasp, grunting]

</line>


<line>
No! No!

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack scoffs]

-[Pickles humming]

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
Sunshine, I have your boba.

</line>


<line>
[Pickles] No whipped cream, I hope.

</line>


<line>
Of course not.

</line>


<line>
You always know how I like it.

</line>


<line>
Is there any chance we could talk IRL?

</line>


<line>
Intimately, rigorously, lengthily?

</line>


<line>
[inhales, exhales]

</line>


<line>
You know, what's funny

is now I actually want the whipped cream.

</line>


<line>
Well, good news, because, uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hmm...

-I don't want to be mad at you.

</line>


<line>
That's great!

</line>


<line>
-No, it's not--

-I know I caused you pain,

but we can get through this.

I still wanna marry you.

</line>


<line>
Do you still want to marry me?

</line>


<line>
Promise me you'll never lie to me again?

</line>


<line>
I promise.

</line>


<line>
Then I guess we could put it behind us

if it just happened the one time.

</line>


<line>
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.

</line>


<line>
Comprised of two separate instances.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-But the spirit of it was once.

</line>


<line>
Well, at least you told me right away.

</line>


<line>
-It happened a few months ago.

-What?

</line>


<line>
-But I'm being honest with you now!

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-At least it wasn't with someone I know.

-It was Diane.

</line>


<line>
Diane, the nice lady

from the chew-toy store?

</line>


<line>
Diane, my ex-wife?

</line>


<line>
That's so much worse!

</line>


<line>
You are a bad dog!

</line>


<line>
-No. No. No!

-[shrieks]

</line>


<line>
-[shattering]

-[Mr. Peanutbutter groans]

</line>


<line>
[Pickles crying]

</line>


<line>
[crying continues]

</line>


<line>
Come on, Eduardo. Hold it together.

You're not just a fainting goat.

</line>


<line>
You're a trained sober companion.

Just do what the sign says.

</line>


<line>
No! [thuds]

</line>


<line>
-[music playing over earbuds]

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[whirring]

</line>


<line>
-Vacuum, stop.

-[automated voice] <ital>Stopping.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Coin sorter, sort. [tinkling]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Coin Sorter,

I'd love to toss my problems in a tray

and say, "Here, sort these out."

I know it doesn't work that way,

but if only this smart house

could give some advice to this stupid dog.

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack imitates robot] Go to her.

-Coin Sorter?

</line>


<line>
Go to Pickles. Go now.

</line>


<line>
I don't know, Coin Sorter.

I've already screwed everything up so bad.

</line>


<line>
I should sit here

and wait for her to come to me.

</line>


<line>
No. You go to her. Leave this room.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-[imitates robot] But don't talk so much!

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.

</line>


<line>
Thermostat, I should have known.

</line>


<line>
I can always count on you

to cool things down

when they get too heated.

You were saying?

</line>


<line>
Sometimes you try to fix problems

or make them go away,

which comes off as dismissive.

</line>


<line>
If you want to solve this, listen.

Really hear her.

</line>


<line>
Beep-boop. Seventy-two degrees.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[both sigh, grunt]

</line>


<line>
[normal voice] Is this mess

why you're moving to Chicago?

</line>


<line>
[normal voice] I told you,

I'm moving for me.

</line>


<line>
I get it.

</line>


<line>
-Are you gonna be okay?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-I mean... I don't know.

-You seem okay.

</line>


<line>
But the reason I had to tell you

I was leaving,

the reason I came

to my ex-husband's house,

was because I need to know

that you're gonna be okay.

</line>


<line>
I need to hear you say it.

</line>


<line>
I can't leave if I don't know

you're going to be okay, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-I'll be okay.

-Promise?

</line>


<line>
Because if something happens,

and I'm in Chicago--

</line>


<line>
That's not a friendship,

that's a hostage situation.

</line>


<line>
Go to Chicago. I'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-[Todd gasps]

-[balloons popping]

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Ruthie?

</line>


<line>
Ruthie! [groans]

</line>


<line>
-[both grunting]

-[balloons popping]

</line>


<line>
-There you are!

-[giggling]

</line>


<line>
Let's get you away

from these delightful choking hazards!

</line>


<line>
You know, Todd, you have a knack for this.

</line>


<line>
Would you wanna be her nanny?

</line>


<line>
I do know her routine

and all of her favorite foods

and how to do funny voices

for bedtime stories,

unlike Carlotta who does voices

like Cameron Diaz

</line>


<line>
"did a voice" for the <ital>Shrek </ital>movies.

</line>


<line>
-[giggles]

-So, that's a yes then?

</line>


<line>
[music playing over earbuds]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
I don't want to be mad at you.

</line>


<line>
It sucks that I have to be mad at you.

</line>


<line>
This should be

the happiest time of my life,

but now because you did something stupid,

I have to feel bad.

</line>


<line>
That's not fair.

</line>


<line>
And I still love you and...

[sighs] I still wanna marry you.

</line>


<line>
But you can't do things

that hurt me like that.

</line>


<line>
It's not okay.

</line>


<line>
And if we just go back

to the way things were before

and pretend nothing happened,

I'm gonna feel stupid.

</line>


<line>
We can't just go back.

</line>


<line>
How can we make this right?

</line>


<line>
Don't just stand there!

I'm talking to you.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.

I want you to trust me.

</line>


<line>
I wanna make us even somehow.

</line>


<line>
Even? The only logical way to be even

would be if I got to sleep

with somebody else.

</line>


<line>
Okay. If that's what needs to happen.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yeah, we just have to think who--

</line>


<line>
Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.

</line>


<line>
Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.

</line>


<line>
No, you don't even know him.

</line>


<line>
Knowing is what hurts the most.

</line>


<line>
What if I sleep with Buzzy <ital>and </ital>Tyler

from Soul Cycle?

</line>


<line>
-Two people?

-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.

</line>


<line>
If we put our heads together,

</line>


<line>
I know we'll find the perfect guy

for you to cheat on me with

that makes it totally even,

so things can go back to normal

and we can get married.

</line>


<line>
-Thank you.

-[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, guys.

-Diane?

</line>


<line>
I'm just here to randomly apologize

for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.

</line>


<line>
It was a big mistake, and it was my fault,

and it will never happen again.

</line>


<line>
Also, I think I left my wallet here

when I came to your party

a year and a half ago.

</line>


<line>
If you find it, probably under the bed

in the master suite,

could you mail it to me?

I live in Chicago now. Thanks.

</line>


<line>
This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.

He's just keeping me sober.

</line>


<line>
Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.

</line>


<line>
-And here's your boba.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-Odd.

-[phone buzzing]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my parents are calling.

-Fun! Put 'em on speaker!
