<nonVerbComm>[BoJack]</nonVerbComm> Who wants

chocolate chip pancakes?

</line>


<line>
I do! I do!

</line>


<line>
Ethan, didn't you already eat

your pancakes?

</line>


<line>
As Oliver North would say,

"I do not recall."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, where's Sabrina?

</line>


<line>
Not hiding under the table,

that's for sure.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience]</nonVerbComm> Aww...

</line>


<line>
Why don't you guys

leave this one to me?

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you dressed

for school, prickly muffin?

</line>


<line>
I'm scared.

Olivia told me

sometimes, at school

they have pop quizzes.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to pop!

</line>


<line>
That's too much, man.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter and applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Sabrina,

nobody's popping on my watch.

</line>


<line>
You stick with me,

and I promise you,

everything's gonna be

just fine.

</line>


<line>
- Cut, boom in the shot.

- What? I'll be in my trailer.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[canned laughter and applause]</nonVerbComm>

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
You folks enjoying the show?

[crowd cheering]

</line>


<line>
And how about Sara Lynn

as Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful?

</line>


<line>
- [cheers and applause]

- Oh. [chuckles] Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn.

You remember that name.

</line>


<line>
Back to one, everybody.

</line>


<line>
- Hey, you see those people?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, those boobs

and jerk wads

are the best friends

you'll ever have.

</line>


<line>
Without them, you're nothing.

Remember that.

</line>


<line>
Let's take it back

to "prickly muffin."

</line>


<line>
Your family will never

understand you,

your lovers will leave you

or try to change you,

but your fans,

you be good to them,

and they'll be good to you.

</line>


<line>
We are rolling.

Sound speed.

</line>


<line>
The most important thing is,

you got to give the people

what they want,

even if it kills you,

even if it empties you out until

there's nothing left to empty.

</line>


<line>
No matter what happens,

no matter how much it hurts,

you don't stop dancing,

and you don't stop smiling,

and you give those people

what they want.

</line>


<line>
And action.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you dressed

for school, prickly muffin?

</line>


<line>
You might remember her

as adorable Sabrina

</line>


<line>
from <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>,

but on her new dance pop album,

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn wants you to know

that she is hot to trot.

</line>

<line>
What is the message

behind your music?

</line>


<line>
America needs to know that I'm

not that little girl anymore.

</line>


<line>
I'm a grown up, sophisticated

woman now, and I have sex,

and I do sexy things.

</line>


<line>
People like sex, okay,

and since I'm sexy right now,

they like me.

</line>


<line>
Are you at all worried

that audiences will grow bored

and abandon you

for the next sexy thing?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Are you kidding?

I'm Sarah freaking Lynn.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna be sexy forever!

</line>


<line>
Pop star and child actress,

Sarah Lynn,

</line>


<line>
celebrates her 30th birthday

this month,

</line>


<line>
raising the question,

"does anyone care

</line>


<line>
about Sarah Lynn anymore?"

After all, she is 30.

</line>


<line>
Here to answer that question,

</line>


<line>
sexy, 14-year-old dubstep

wunderkind, Sextina Aquafina.

</line>


<line>
Hey!

[applause]

</line>


<line>
Sextina,

what's your take?

</line>


<line>
I love Sarah Lynn.

I grew up on her music, okay,

and she's, like, an inspiration,

but now, she is old,

and shriveled, and gross, and

nobody want her no more, okay?

</line>


<line>
They want Sextina Aquafina,

baby!

</line>


<line>
Ha ha!

You're delightful.

</line>


<line>
So where does Sarah Lynn

go from here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you know where

she should go?

</line>


<line>
She should go

wherever famous people go

when they're done being famous,

and nobody cares

if they live or die.

</line>


<line>

<line>
Who-o-o wants

chocolate chip pancakes?

</line>


<line>
I do! I do!

</line>


<line>
Why are you talking to me?

</line>


<line>
I thought maybe

if I said that,

</line>


<line>
you'd make me

chocolate chip pancakes.

</line>


<line>
- [grumbles]

- Oh, come on, buddy.

</line>


<line>
It's a beautiful morning,

the sun is shining,

</line>


<line>
- birds are chirping--

- Hey, BoJack,

</line>


<line>
-any plans for the weekend?

- Still hate the troops, Boj?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you refill

your bird feeder, huh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, who's a bird

got to blow

</line>


<line>
- to get some seed around here?

- [chuckles] Good one.

</line>


<line>
Let's do something fun

today.

</line>


<line>
- Like what?

- Like a cannonball!

</line>


<line>
Like a

"buying you a new bed"?

</line>


<line>
Wow, everything in this store

is made

</line>


<line>
out of old train tracks

and a reclaimed pier.

</line>


<line>
Oh, great, for ten grand,

I can sleep like a hobo.

</line>


<line>
Do we need letter openers

</line>


<line>
made out of Confederate

bayonets?

</line>


<line>
It says they're stained

with authentic Yankee blood.

</line>


<line>
O-M-G. O-M-G!

O-M-M-F-C-S-D-V-R-Q-Q-P-Q-F-G!

</line>


<line>
- I know.

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's me,

straight off your TV screens

</line>


<line>
and into your shitty lives.

</line>


<line>
It's Sarah Lynn

and Andrew Garfield.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screams]</nonVerbComm>

Huh? What the--?

</line>


<line>
And what's your name,

darling?

</line>


<line>
I-- mm--

</line>


<line>
I'll just make it out

to "Evelyn."

</line>


<line>
Uh--

</line>


<line>
Um, hi.

Sarah Lynn, hi.

</line>


<line>
BoJack? Hey. Andrew,

this is BoJack, my TV dad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello,

I'm Andrew Garfield.

</line>


<line>
Andrew's my boyfriend.

We're a celebrity power couple.

</line>


<line>
It's no big deal.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[whispering]</nonVerbComm>

It's a really big deal.

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted

to talk to you about that.

</line>


<line>
When we started dating,

you were the biggest star

in the world,

but your last few albums tanked,

so now, I don't even know

what you are anymore.

</line>


<line>
Are you-- Are you breaking up

with me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, bother.

</line>


<line>
Um, are those candy pills,

</line>


<line>
'cause if so,

that is a lot of sugar.

</line>


<line>
Why are you doing this to me?

</line>


<line>
Do you like seeing me suffer?

</line>


<line>
Because you know

I'll bleed for you.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

[all gasp]

</line>


<line>
- Oh!

- Damn!

</line>


<line>
- Oh, dear.

- Whoa-oh-oh. Um--

</line>


<line>
Darling, please, I wanted

to do this in a public place

so you wouldn't make a scene.

</line>


<line>
You think I won't make

a scene, you limey bastard?

</line>


<line>
Then you really

don't know me at all.

</line>


<line>
Hey, everyone!

Who wants to see me take a dump

on that sofa?

</line>


<line>
And then she took a dump

on a sofa

made out of a reclaimed

propeller.

</line>


<line>
Where's Sarah Lynn now?

</line>


<line>
I checked her into Promises.

28 days, she'll be good as new.

</line>


<line>
How did it feel

to check the girl

you raised on television

into rehab?

</line>


<line>
It was tough.

</line>


<line>
I would have liked

to reconnect with her.

</line>


<line>
At least we got to bond a little

on the drive to Malibu.

</line>


<line>
I can see my organs.

</line>


<line>
Oh, whoa! She is losing

a lot of blood, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Beautiful day for a drive,

though, huh?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe the two of you

can catch up some more

when she gets out of rehab.

</line>


<line>
People don't usually want to

hang out with me after rehab.

</line>


<line>
I'm really more

of a before-rehab friend.

</line>


<line>
I think it's gonna be

a long time

before I see Sarah Lynn again.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[horse whinnying doorbell ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Who could that be?

</line>


<line>
Look, BoJack, I appreciate

what you were trying to do,

but I don't need rehab.

Look, good as new, huh?

</line>


<line>
Oh, great,

well, that's a relief.

</line>


<line>
Uh, should you be taking

all those pills?

</line>


<line>
It's

dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

</line>


<line>
- I got it from a doctor.

- Your doctor or just a doctor?

</line>


<line>
I don't know,

some doctor, okay?

</line>


<line>
I met him at Adam Levine's

Halloween party.

</line>


<line>
I think he said

his name was Dr. Who.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I don't think

that was--

</line>


<line>
Ohh, God damn.

</line>


<line>
Uh, are you supposed to be

snorting it like that?

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

What are you, the paramedic

who restarted my heart at

Adam Levine's Halloween party?

</line>


<line>
Okay, so before we

put to bed the whole

</line>


<line>
- you going to rehab thing--

- BoJack, all my life,

</line>


<line>
I've never been forced

to confront my problems head on.

</line>


<line>
No one has ever said "no" to me,

ever, so is it cool

if instead of confronting

my problems head on,

</line>


<line>
I just hide out here

for a little bit?

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn,

I hear what you're saying,

and I think I know

what you need.

</line>


<line>
You just need

a strong, responsible adult

to say, "Yes.

Yes, you can move in with me."

</line>


<line>
This is gonna be fun.

Hey, everyone,

the old gang's getting

back together.

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ Three little orphans</ital>

<ital>One, two, three </ital>♪

</line>


<line>
Who-o-o wants

chocolate chip pancakes?

</line>


<line>
I do! I do!

</line>


<line>
Uh, what's going on

in here?

</line>


<line>
Morning, sleepy-pooh,

you want pancakes?

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

that sounds great.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, tough break, champ.

I just gave the last one

to Sarah Lynn.

Early bird gets the worm.

</line>


<line>
More like early turd

gets the sperm.

</line>


<line>
Wha-- "Early turd gets the sperm,"

nice one, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
You should do

a Shouts and Murmurs.

</line>


<line>
Help yourself

to some cold wheat bran, sport.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Thanks for letting me

crash here, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
The guest room is yours

as long as you want.

</line>


<line>
You have a guest room?

</line>


<line>
Why have I been sleeping

on the couch for five years?

</line>


<line>
You'll get the guest room when

you've earned the guest room.

</line>


<line>
These pancakes are so good.

</line>


<line>
All Andrew ever wanted to eat

was stupid lasagna.

</line>


<line>
Andrew Garfield

loves lasagna?

</line>


<line>
I don't want to talk

about him!

</line>


<line>
BoJack, can you drive me

to the mall today?

</line>


<line>
I really want to go shopping,

but I'm not allowed to drive

because somebody got a DUI.

</line>


<line>
Uh, that somebody was you,

right?

</line>


<line>
I don't have to answer

your questions!

</line>


<line>
What are you,

the cop that pulled me over

after Adam Levine's

Halloween party?

</line>


<line>
Honey, do you really think

going to the mall's a good idea?

</line>


<line>
I seem to recall another time

you went shopping

when things got

pretty out of control.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's too much, man!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheering and theme music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Really? Not the time

when she gored herself

with a bayonet

and shat on a floor model?

</line>


<line>
Hey,

I'm not the crazy one.

</line>


<line>
Andrew's the one

who flies off the handle

whenever his agent sets up

an audition on a Monday.

</line>


<line>
Andrew Garfield hates Mondays

and loves lasagna?

</line>


<line>
I said I don't want

to talk about it!

</line>


<line>
- She said drop it, Todd!

- Whatever,

</line>


<line>
I don't want to go

to the stupid mall.

</line>


<line>
I'll just tell my friends

to come here.

</line>


<line>
Muffin, I've got to work

on my book today,

and I can't have

a bunch of folks over

making a lot of noise.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I see.

I'm a burden to you.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, no, no.

Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
I'm no longer cute, so I have

nothing to offer this world.

</line>


<line>
Honey, of course your friends

are always welcome here.

</line>


<line>
Cool. Bye.

</line>


<line>
- Can I invite a frien--

- No.

</line>


<line>
You let that basket case

into your house?

</line>


<line>
That girl is a PR hurricane

that you don't need right now.

</line>


<line>
She has nowhere else to turn.

She broke up with her boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
She stabbed herself and

closed the wound with duct tape.

</line>


<line>
- She fired her agent.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
Back it up, horsey.

</line>


<line>
Did you say Sarah Lynn

doesn't have an agent?

</line>


<line>
Laura, hold my calls,

cancel everything!

I'm not looking

Oh, whoa, whoa. Who says

I'm looking for a new client?

<line>
Slow your roll,

Speed Racer.

</line>


<line>
We're just two single ladies

having a no-presh rap sesh.

</line>


<line>
I'm not one of those agents

who can't turn it off.

</line>


<line>
Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa

Geckos and what have you.

</line>


<line>
Vanessa Gecko is actually

Andrew's agent,

and she's really great.

</line>


<line>
Is she?

I've heard that.

</line>


<line>
I didn't realize you were

so into house music.

</line>


<line>
Look, I asked her

to turn it down, but apparently,

this volume was prescribed

by Dr. Who

to treat something called

"uptight dickhead disease."

</line>


<line>
What do you-- What do you think

about Sarah Lynn?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't really think

about her all that much.

</line>


<line>
I mean, obviously,

I'm a fan of her early work

which both satirized

and celebrated

youth culture's obsession

with sex,

but I do wonder

as a third-wave feminist

if it's even possible for women

to reclaim their sexuality

in this deeply entrenched

patriarchal society,

or if claiming to do so

is just a lie we tell ourselves

so we can more comfortably cater

to the male gaze.

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what?

- But you know,

on the other hand, I worry

that conversations like this one

often dismiss her as a mere

puppet of the industry...

</line>


<line>
- That's my same worry.

- ...incapable of engaging

</line>


<line>
- in these discussions herself...

- Obviously.

</line>


<line>
...and infantilization,

which is itself a product

</line>


<line>
- of the deeply misogynistic...

- So deep.

</line>


<line>
...society we live in.

But like I said,

</line>


<line>
I don't really think about her

all that much.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well,

that is very interesting,

but I was more asking,

like, what do you think

about her living here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Well, what was

your relationship like

with her when you were working

on the show?

</line>


<line>
It was very good,

very professional.

</line>


<line>
BoJack,

where did you go to college?

</line>


<line>
- Don't bother him, honey.

- Oh, it's no problem.

</line>


<line>
Honey, college is for

ugly people who can't tap dance.

</line>


<line>
- I want to be an architect.

- [laughing] Sweetheart,

</line>


<line>
Mommy didn't do what Mommy did

to that <ital>Star Search </ital>producer

so that you could be

an architect.

</line>


<line>
- Aw.

- All right,

</line>


<line>
- take it sleazy, everybody.

- Wait, BoJack,

um, what are you doing

this weekend?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

I'll probably just go

to the amusement park,

maybe the circus,

fly a kite on the beach,

watch the sunset,

then I'll head

back to my place

to watch any number

of Disney princess movies

while eating ice cream

straight from the tub.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, that sounds like

so much fun.

</line>


<line>
Can I come?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm> Yeah,

like I want to spend my weekend

hanging out with a little girl.

[laughing] Good one!

</line>


<line>
You should write

for the Shouts and Murmurs.

</line>


<line>
See you Monday!

</line>


<line>
So the makeup

they were putting on you

was not for the show,

it was just for the weekend?

</line>


<line>
Why does that matter?

</line>


<line>
I'm just trying

to understand the story.

</line>


<line>
Do you think it's possible

that you inviting Sarah Lynn

into your house now is your way

of compensating for not--

</line>


<line>
No, Diane,

I'm just helping out a friend.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying to play out

some weird, sick dad fantasy,

or resolve a deep guilt

for past neglect,

or even try to retroactively fix

my own childhood

by recreating someone else's,

and I'm especially not doing

all those things at once!

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
- [loud crash]

- What happened?

</line>


<line>
Did somebody hurt

my precious baby?

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn! Ah!

What the--?

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I told my friends they could

tear this wall out to build

a sweet cocaine booth/sex

closet.

</line>


<line>
- Is that cool?

- No, that's not cool.

</line>


<line>
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,

Kissinger.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't realize.

</line>


<line>
I thought this was a place

where Sarah Lynn

could finally be Sarah Lynn,

but I guess...

that's too much, man.

</line>


<line>
I always loved

that catch phrase.

</line>


<line>
Can your friends at least take

the artwork off the wall first?

</line>


<line>
Ooh.

I want to say yes, but no.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, good talk.

- Wha-- Are you serious?

</line>


<line>
The reason I have called

this house meeting is--

</line>


<line>
Todd, how many times

have we been over this?

</line>


<line>
You don't have the authority

to call house meetings.

</line>


<line>
Only I can call a house meeting.

You can propose a house meeting.

</line>


<line>
All right, fine, fine, fine,

but the reason I propose

</line>


<line>
- this house meeting--

- Your proposal has been

submitted and

is under board review.

</line>


<line>
- Proposal denied.

- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

is getting out of control, okay?

She's taking advantage of you.

</line>


<line>
What? No she's not.

We have a special relationship.

</line>


<line>
You couldn't possibly

understand.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. Look at what

she's done to your house.

</line>


<line>
All right, look, I mean,

I stepped on a needle earlier.

</line>


<line>
I think I'm addicted

to heroin now,

so now, that's probably

gonna be a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
I have to say,

I agree with Todd.

</line>


<line>
You're not this girl's father,

and you're not doing her

any favors by refusing

to set boundaries.

</line>


<line>
Look, I played a dad

for nine years on TV,

so I think I know a little bit

more about parenting

than you two jokers.

The kids on <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

didn't need boundaries.

</line>


<line>
All they needed was

some good, old-fashioned love.

</line>


<line>
BoJack!

This is not a TV show, okay?

</line>


<line>
This is real life.

</line>


<line>
Ah! Lemur on fire!

Lemur on fire!

</line>


<line>
Some good, old-fashioned love,

and I'm gonna give it to her.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna give it to her

so... hard.

</line>


<line>
You know, I feel like

we don't ever hang out.

</line>


<line>
Here you are, milady,

a gin and nutmeg

just like you asked.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

Too much nutmeg.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know what

would taste even better?

</line>


<line>
An endorsement

for a Slovakian yogurt.

</line>


<line>
Could Vanessa Gecko

get you that?

</line>


<line>
Vanessa Gecko got Andrew

<ital>The Social Network</ital>,

and she has skybox seats

at the Staples Center.

</line>


<line>
- What do you have?

- Well, I've got a table

at the Comedy Central roast

of Gloria Stein--

</line>


<line>
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say

we spend the day together,

just you and me,

away from all the haters?

</line>


<line>

Hey, did you hear

Kazaz got cancer?

</line>


<line>
What?

Herb Kazaz has cancer?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, in the butt. He's got,

like, six months I think.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's horrible.

Why would you tell me that now?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. The sun setting

over those two hills

made me think of a big ass,

and that made me think

of ass cancer,

and that made me think

of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.

You really didn't know?

</line>


<line>
No, Herb and I aren't

on the best--

</line>


<line>
Look, I'm trying to have

a moment here. I can't--

</line>


<line>
Hey, I want to give you

something.

</line>


<line>
Is this

your TV Guide award?

</line>


<line>
It's the most prestigious

award I ever won.

</line>


<line>
I always thought if I ever

had kids of my own,

</line>


<line>
I'd give it to them one day.

I want you to have it.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow. BoJack, thanks.

You're sweet.

Did you get rid

of your old TV Guide award?

</line>


<line>
This pawnshop on La Cienega

was selling one

</line>


<line>
- with your name on it.

- What?

</line>


<line>
Wait, why were you

at a pawnshop?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I just have a guy there

who calls me

whenever TV awards come in

so I can buy 'em.

</line>


<line>
I put my name on,

it's like I won it myself!

</line>


<line>
I have two Golden Globes

Okay, party's over.

Everybody out.

</line>


<line>
- [all] Aw!

- Not you.

</line>


<line>
You are in big trouble,

young lady.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe

you pawned my award.

</line>


<line>
It wasn't personal. I just

thought your award was stupid,

and I already have

a billion other awards,

and I wanted to get money

for drugs.

</line>


<line>
Look, things have been tough

for you, and I understand that.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're

going through right now.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm> Oh, you know

what I'm going through? Why?

</line>


<line>
Because you were on some dumb

kids show a million years ago?

</line>


<line>
- Hey, now.

- I had my own fashion line

when I was ten.

By 20, I was packing stadiums.

</line>


<line>
I get letters every day

from boys telling me

that I was the first girl

they masturbated to.

</line>


<line>
Literally, someone

tells me that every day.

</line>


<line>
- That is gross.

- Oh-ho, I know!

</line>


<line>
You sit up here

in your little house

and feel sorry for yourself?

Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

in order to be a has-been,

you have to have actually,

</line>


<line>
- you know, been.

- You are way out of line!

</line>


<line>
You're not my dad.

You're just a rugged, older man

who provided me with a strong,

masculine presence

during my formative years.

</line>


<line>
I'm not your dad,

and you're not my child.

</line>


<line>
We're just a man and a lady

living in a house together,

and we're both adults,

and we're both a little drunk.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both groaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Who-o-o lit my ottoman

on fire?

</line>


<line>
Seriously,

you seriously don't know?

</line>


<line>
I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you are bad,

very bad!

</line>


<line>
You want me to put it out

with my boob?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, what?

- Your boob

is a very impractical way

to put out a fire.

</line>


<line>
What is happening?

</line>


<line>
I think you have

a serious drug problem.

</line>


<line>
The only drug I need

is horse.

</line>


<line>
Guys, guys,

what are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Please don't do this.

[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
No, no. Why are you--

[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
- [whinnies]

- This is a very bad idea.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning]</nonVerbComm>

Can I at least get my blanket--

</line>


<line>
Let me get my blanket

out from under--

</line>


<line>
Oh G-- Oh, my God, my arm.

</line>


<line>
- You got my arm.

- [laughs] Ow! Ow!

</line>


<line>
I'm in it now.

Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both moaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I still haven't regained

the feeling in my fingers.

</line>


<line>
That was the longest two minutes

of my life.

</line>


<line>
Um, I think it was a little

longer than two minutes.

</line>


<line>
It was longer

than two minutes.

</line>


<line>
How do you not get

that this is terrible?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you mean

from a P.R. standpoint?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,

oh, I would get flayed!

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm done being

the voice of reason.

</line>


<line>
It's exhausting.

I got to take an angry nap.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

</line>


<line>
I know. I know.

She's taking advantage of me.

</line>


<line>
Actually, it kind of feels

like you're the one

taking advantage of her.

She's the one

with substance abuse problems

and daddy issues.

</line>


<line>
Hey, we both have

substance abuse problems

</line>


<line>
- and daddy issues.

- Yeah, but she came to you

</line>


<line>
- for help.

- [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Hey, notice how

I've been ignoring you,

playing hard to get?

Only makes you want me more.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Go stand

on the other side of the room.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

</line>


<line>
- I'm taking you to rehab.

- Nah,

</line>


<line>
I was gonna keep hanging out

here if that's all right.

</line>


<line>
- No, it's not all right.

- What?

</line>


<line>
This place isn't good

for you.

</line>


<line>
You need to go where you can

get help, real help.

</line>


<line>
But I thought you were always

gonna be there for me

like you said.

</line>


<line>
I will always

be there for you.

</line>


<line>
Cut, let's take ten.

</line>


<line>
That's ten, everyone.

Let's make it a tight ten.

</line>


<line>
- These pages are shit.

- [coughs]

you understand?

Shit.

</line>


<line>
I wouldn't wipe my ass

with these pages.

</line>


<line>
It would defeat the whole

purpose of wiping my ass.

</line>


<line>
- Phone for you.

- Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
You get me points

on the back end?

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- Well, I told you

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna do it

unless I get points.

</line>


<line>
Oh, they can't find any?

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe they could

suck some out of my dick!

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- I'm on the phone.

</line>


<line>
- You're being very rude.

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
You promised me you would

always be there.

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn,

this is for your own good.

</line>


<line>
You can't stay here anymore.

</line>


<line>
Okie-doke.

I guess I'll just move out

and find

one of the billion people

who will let me party

at their house.

</line>


<line>
Uh, well,

you should not do that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I know. I know,

but I can, so I will.

</line>


<line>
I'm at a place right now

where I never need

to grow as a person

or rise to an occasion

because I can constantly

just surround myself

with sycophants and enablers

until I die tragically young.

</line>


<line>
- Wh-What?

- Yeah,

it's pretty much

too late for me.

</line>


<line>
Well, them's the breaks.

Take it sleazy, everybody.

</line>


<line>
Oh, by the way,

I called Vanessa Gecko,

and I'm meeting with her

tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
- Thanks for the suggestion.

- No! No, no, no, no, no!

</line>


<line>
Hey, you guys want to hear

my new catchphrase?

</line>


<line>
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[blows raspberry]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Laura, the dummy took the bait.

Now for phase two.

</line>


<line>
Is she gone?

Is it safe to come out?

</line>


<line>
Leak to the trades

that Andrew Garfield's agent

is taking meetings with his ex,

get it all over town,

wait an hour,

then get me lunch with Andrew

on the books for this weekend,

someplace Italian.

</line>


<line>
I really blew it,

didn't I?

</line>


<line>
I mean, maybe you could

have been a better role model

when she was young, but also,

she never really had a chance.

</line>


<line>
This is what our celebrity

culture does to people.

</line>


<line>
So what you're saying is,

Everything is society's fault,

and we as individuals

never need

to take responsibility

for anything?

</line>


<line>
Uh, no. Not exactly.

I was just saying that--

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I like that.

I didn't do anything wrong

because I can't do

anything wrong

because we're all just products

of our environment,

bouncing around like marbles

in the game

of Hungry Hungry Hippos

that is our random

and cruel universe.

</line>


<line>
Wait, no, that's not even

what I'm saying--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, It's not my fault.

It's society.

</line>


<line>
Everything is

because of society!

</line>


<line>
- BoJack, that--

- Dude, just let him have this.

</line>


<line>
Hooray!

Everything is meaningless!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Nothing I do</ital>

<ital>has consequence!</ital>

</line>


<line>
So what'd you get,

anything good?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I got everything.
