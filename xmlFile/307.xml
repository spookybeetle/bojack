<line>
[mumbling]

</line>


<line>
[gagging]

</line>


<line>
-[voices overlapping]

-[groaning]

</line>


<line>
Guys, I think we could use

another phone jack over here.

</line>


<line>
[phone ringing]

</line>


<line>
Cabracadabra.

We wanna reach out and grab you.

</line>


<line>
-No, we're a cab company.

-Can you toss me the thing?

</line>


<line>
[grunting]

</line>


<line>
-Sorry. The other thing.

-[Todd] Okay. Watch the couch.

</line>


<line>
Hey. Goddammit!

</line>


<line>
-[yelling]

-I apologize for... I understand.

</line>


<line>
Mind if I put you on hold one second?

</line>


<line>
Don't put me on hold.

Do you know who I am?

</line>


<line>
I just won a Baby's Choice Award,

the winner of which

has gone to take home the Oscar

seven of the last 15 years.

</line>


<line>
So, yeah, <ital>that </ital>BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise known as the guy you keep

sending your dumb newspaper to

even though I never subscribed to it.

</line>


<line>
I'm putting you on hold.

</line>


<line>
-[muttering]

-[buzzing]

</line>


<line>
-We have a situation, sir.

-Talk to me.

</line>


<line>
Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.

He's pretty steamed.

</line>


<line>
I've tried everything, but we might need

to bring the Closer in on this one.

</line>


<line>
Calm down. We can sort this out

without having to get the Closer involved.

</line>


<line>
Did you offer 26 weeks

at 50 percent off the newsstand price?

</line>


<line>
I went through the entire checklist, sir.

Even offered him a free tote bag.

</line>


<line>
What kind of monster says no

to a tote bag? Good work, rep.

</line>


<line>
You've done all that could be

expected of you. I'll take it from here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Got it. Right.

I understand. I'll take it from here.

</line>


<line>
God help us...

</line>


<line>
Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.

Fortunately, we got one better.

</line>


<line>
Morning. Good morning.

How was your weekend? How are you?

</line>


<line>
Good work yesterday.

Get out of my way, please.

</line>


<line>
[sighing]

</line>


<line>
We have a situation on line two.

Name's Horseman. BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

</line>


<line>
Hello, good morning, and I say this

with 100 percent sincerity...

</line>


<line>
<ital>How can I help you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[funky electronic music]

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
I never subscribed to the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

I do not read the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I have called this number so many times

to stop sending it to me.

</line>


<line>
Yet every morning, I open my door

on a new edition of the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's like I'm in a boring episode

of <ital>The Twilight Zone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.

</line>


<line>
But before we dig in,

is there anything I can get you?

</line>


<line>
A glass of ice water perhaps?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

</line>


<line>
Fabulous. Johnny will get that to you

in three, two, one...

</line>


<line>
-[drone whirring]

-Uh... huh.

</line>


<line>
I see you've been receiving

our paper for six months,

</line>


<line>
but there's no record of you

ever registering a complaint.

</line>


<line>
From whence the hostility, counselor?

</line>


<line>
It wasn't a problem until recently,

because up until a week ago

</line>


<line>
the boy who lives with me used the paper

to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-I live with my best friend, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Good kid, but sometimes

he gets ideas to do things.

</line>


<line>
[groaning, screaming]

</line>


<line>
-Pretty scary, right?

-Yes. What the hell is that?

</line>


<line>
Giant Todd Head, of course.

</line>


<line>
I've been working on him

for the last six months.

</line>


<line>
What? Why?

</line>


<line>
It all started

when a rustling from the kitchen

</line>


<line>
jostled me from tender slumber.

</line>


<line>
-[blinds rattling]

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
What was that?

</line>


<line>
[gasping]

</line>


<line>
If there's a ghost present,

please do not scream

or have a skull face or be wearing

a tattered white satin gown.

</line>


<line>
[gasping]

</line>


<line>
Someone or something is stealing our food.

</line>


<line>
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head

to scare it away. Think it'll work?

</line>


<line>
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,

would you stop eating my food?

</line>


<line>
You should take this seriously.

We might have an infestation.

</line>


<line>
We do have an infestation, of Todds.

Look at that, they're getting bigger.

</line>


<line>
And? Did the head help to ameliorate

your pest peccadillo?

</line>


<line>
No. Todd abandoned the project as soon

as he started working on Cabracadabra.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-What's Cabracadabra?</ital>

-That's what I said.

</line>


<line>
-What's Cabracadabra?

-That's what I said.

</line>


<line>
-What's Cabracadabra?

-That's what we want you to say.

</line>


<line>
If I didn't know any better,

you were about to pitch an idea.

</line>


<line>
-We <ital>are </ital>about to pitch you an idea.

-I did not know better.

</line>


<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

Hey, where you headed?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.

</line>


<line>
-We're not at the main part yet.

-I'm so sorry. Please continue.

</line>


<line>
-To the opera, good sir.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Am I watching to see if the whole thing

has happened to me?

</line>


<line>
-Or looking for one specific thing?

-Kind of both.

</line>


<line>
So I just keep watching until I see

something that has happened to me?

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-What if we get to the end,

none of it has ever happened to me?

</line>


<line>
Maybe just try to put yourself

in Emily's shoes right now.

</line>


<line>
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.

Please continue.

</line>


<line>
-So, is this where you live?

-Yes, it is.

</line>


<line>
-Alone or are you in a relationship?

-This hardly seems appropriate.

</line>


<line>
Driver, you're starting

to make me feel uncomfortable.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Has a creepy driver

ever given you his number

or told you that you reminded him

of his dead girlfriend?

</line>


<line>
Or repeated your address slowly,

like he was trying to memorize it?

</line>


<line>
-No, never.

-Unfortunately, if you are a woman

all those things

would happen to you every day.

</line>


<line>
That's right, Todd.

According to my own research,

nine out of ten men

are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.

</line>


<line>
But what if there was a ride-share service

that could guarantee

no creepy men drivers

because there are no men drivers at all?

</line>


<line>
What are you saying, robot drivers?

</line>


<line>
What if they become sentient

and try to murder us, or unionize?

</line>


<line>
That could be a real headache.

</line>


<line>
No, not murderous robots. Women.

</line>


<line>
Todd, you have done it again.

</line>


<line>
Actually, Emily and I

came up with it together.

</line>


<line>
Todd and Emily,

you've done it again for the first time.

</line>


<line>
And that's why we're setting up shop

at your house.

</line>


<line>
Why does it have to be my house?

</line>


<line>
There's no room

at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

</line>


<line>
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-Who can recall?

</line>


<line>
I figure the longer they're there,

the bigger the payoff.

</line>


<line>
And they've been sitting there

for months now.

</line>


<line>
So you can bet

the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>So, why did you let them use your house?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Todd, where do you want this...?

</line>


<line>
[both]

Uh...

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>I felt guilty.</ital>

[The Closer] <ital>About what?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>Todd had this old girlfriend.</ital>

<ital>I met her a couple weeks back.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
-What are you still doing up?

-I got thirsty.

</line>


<line>
Then you came to the right place.

</line>


<line>
Should we call Todd,

see if he wants to join us?

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of trying to figure out

what Todd wants.

</line>


<line>
And what do you want?

</line>


<line>
-I'll start with a whiskey.

-My kind of girl.

</line>


<line>
-So then we had sex.

-What? Why?

</line>


<line>
I was lonely? She was there?

Why does anyone have sex with anyone?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Intimacy, affection, a deep need</ital>

<ital>to connect to the world at large.</ital>

</line>


<line>
The same reasons three million people

subscribe to the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

<ital>-I'm getting ahead of myself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Please, continue your story.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[exhaling]

</line>


<line>
-You should go.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
That was a mistake.

</line>


<line>
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake

for you and a regular mistake for me.

</line>


<line>
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.

</line>


<line>
-What are we gonna tell Todd?

-Nothing, obviously.

</line>


<line>
-I don't want to hurt him.

-Neither do I.

</line>


<line>
-That's why we won't tell him.

-I feel like we should tell him.

</line>


<line>
That feeling is you selfishly

trying to assuage your guilt.

</line>


<line>
If you cared about Todd,

you would keep this a secret forever.

</line>


<line>
I'm not good at lying.

</line>


<line>
Ask me if when I was a little girl,

did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

in my underpants

and rock back and forth on it.

</line>


<line>
When you were a little girl,

did you ever do that thing you said?

</line>


<line>
What? Get-- [stammers] No!

</line>


<line>
I think it's gonna be fine.

Why would it even come up?

</line>


<line>
Not like there's any reason

the three of us

would ever be in a room together again.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

</line>


<line>
-I've never seen you before in my life.

-No.

</line>


<line>
-You don't remember BoJack?

-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

</line>


<line>
What... why... What are you here?

Why are you doing at Todd's house?

</line>


<line>
Todd's house? This is my house.

</line>


<line>
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?

That's not gonna be weird?

</line>


<line>
What? Why would that be weird?

</line>


<line>
-What are you implying?

-Nothing.

</line>


<line>
It's not weird for me either,

if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, what is going on here?

-Why would you? I don't even--

</line>


<line>
-Literally nothing going on.

-No, something's going on.

</line>


<line>
I've got a nose for news.

</line>


<line>
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter

representing the variable

for "What Is Going On?"

</line>


<line>
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

</line>


<line>
I think someone's not saying something

to someone else about something.

</line>


<line>
-That's crazy.

-I know what it is.

</line>


<line>
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

</line>


<line>
No one wants to say it out loud

because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

</line>


<line>
Yes. Your stupid business

is gonna be very successful.

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-Glad that's out in the open.

</line>


<line>
We all know what everyone was thinking,

we don't need to ask

any more questions

or do any wondering about mysteries.

</line>


<line>
Nope.

</line>


<line>
If you'll excuse me,

I need to go watch a sport.

</line>


<line>
Great idea.

</line>


<line>
The worst part is things have actually

been going really well with Todd.

</line>


<line>
Our friendship is in a really good place.

</line>


<line>
Last week he said,

</line>


<line>
"Did you know the wiener dog

is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

</line>


<line>
Instead of saying,

"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

</line>


<line>
[The Closer] <ital>So, why did you</ital>

<ital>sleep with Emily?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you think that part of you was getting</ital>

<ital>uncomfortable with that closeness?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You felt like you didn't deserve</ital>

<ital>Todd's friendship</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and you wanted to somehow</ital>

<ital>externalize that feeling into action?</ital>

</line>


<line>
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.

Can't it just be that?

</line>


<line>
When you do bad things,

you have something you can point to

when people eventually leave you.

</line>


<line>
It's not you, you tell yourself,

it's that bad thing you did.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Are you afraid of being known</ital>

<ital>and knowing others?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you know, I think that you're

definitely hitting on something real

that I would love to drill down into,

but I gotta go

to this marketing meeting now.

</line>


<line>
Which is so annoying

because I totally want to keep talking

about that thing you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
But marketing meetings, right?

</line>


<line>
I mean, they're so important.

Can I call you back tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Of course.</ital>

-Great. Bye.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</ital>

-Weird.

</line>


<line>
-Sorry I'm late.

-It's fine. We're just getting started.

</line>


<line>
I had the worst morning.

</line>


<line>
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

</line>


<line>
So I drove here, right?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</ital>

<ital>when I realize I don't have my key card.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>When I got there,</ital>

<ital>I couldn't find it anywhere.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Suddenly, I remember:</ital>

<ital>I put it in the glove compartment.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It was in my car the entire time.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Because I was driving back and forth

so much, I ran out of gas.

</line>


<line>
I pulled into a 76.

</line>


<line>
I was about to pump the gas,

I realized I didn't have my credit card,

when I remembered

it was on my desk at home

because I used it to contribute to

my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

</line>


<line>
Diane...

</line>


<line>
Have you donated

to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, shit.

-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, but I don't like feeling

like I have to, Roxy.

</line>


<line>
Does the world need

a stop-motion short film

about a pig who goes to circus school?

</line>


<line>
Think of it like you're doing

a nice thing for your friend.

</line>


<line>
Mmm... okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I called a cab to take me home</ital>

<ital>to get my credit card.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Then back to the gas station, get my car,

fill it up and come here.

</line>


<line>
So that's why I'm late.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you tell us that whole story?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
-Why did you tell me that whole story?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up

some options for the new <ital>Secretariat </ital>ads.

</line>


<line>
Good news is the movie

is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

</line>


<line>
If everyone loves it,

why do we need a new ad campaign?

</line>


<line>
These are

the "For Your Consideration" ads.

</line>


<line>
They're a reminder to the Academy,

"Have you considered this yet?"

</line>


<line>
The Academy doesn't always

consider everything.

</line>


<line>
So they need constant

consideration reminders.

</line>


<line>
-That's very considerate.

-This one tested the best.

</line>


<line>
That's a good one.

The rest of these suck.

</line>


<line>
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

</line>


<line>
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

</line>


<line>
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

</line>


<line>
-I am really good at this.

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
-I kind of like this one.

-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

</line>


<line>
We ruled that one out.

</line>


<line>
It's actually really powerful.

</line>


<line>
[The Closer] <ital>What spoke to you</ital>

<ital>about that particular ad?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>I don't know.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>All the pictures of me,</ital>

<ital>they looked backwards.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>When I looked at the mirror ad,</ital>

<ital>I was seeing me as I see myself</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and I thought</ital>

<ital>there was something beautiful about that.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Intimate, almost.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Of course you like this ad.

When you look at it

you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

</line>


<line>
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?

No? You're just some old turtle?

</line>


<line>
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."

-But you've got the heart of a champion.

</line>


<line>
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars

who say different.

</line>


<line>
Isn't that the point of the movie,

that anybody could be Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
The point of the movie is to make

a lot of money and win awards.

</line>


<line>
If anyone who looks at this ad

is Secretariat,

why should you win the Oscar?

</line>


<line>
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you

leave this to the experts, okay?

</line>


<line>
-Yes. You're a star.

-[moaning]

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>Yeah, couple times.</ital>

<ital>We have a very complicated relationship.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's complicated.

</line>


<line>
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep

movie, it would be <ital>Doubt.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Don't forget, you have <ital>Ellen</ital> tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

</line>


<line>
Yes. You're in charge.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you know, I gotta say

I don't feel like I'm in charge.

</line>


<line>
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,

forget the whole thing.

</line>


<line>
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we

having sex in my car?

</line>


<line>
-Can we at least go back to your place?

-No, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I don't know where you live.

</line>


<line>
You control every part of my life,

I don't know anything about you.

</line>


<line>
[scoffs]

</line>


<line>
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.

-No, I do.

</line>


<line>
-I want to be known and know others.

-You don't.

</line>


<line>
I know you and I know what you want.

This is exactly what you want.

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>What do you think she meant by that?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Better question:

Why am I still getting the <ital>L.A. Gazette?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do you think getting the paper every day

is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

</line>


<line>
<ital>The project he abandoned</ital>

<ital>to make time for the old girlfriend</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you spent an intimate night with?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Could that be why you want

to cancel your subscription?

</line>


<line>
No. I want to cancel my subscription

because newspapers are dumb.

</line>


<line>
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

</line>


<line>
Every morning,

someone knocks on my door and says,

</line>


<line>
"Throw away this garbage for me."

</line>


<line>
So you don't feel any guilt

about your tryst with Emily?

</line>


<line>
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

</line>


<line>
[Emily and Todd laughing]

</line>


<line>
[Todd] You're silly.

[Emily] No, you're silly.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.

-Truth.

</line>


<line>
What is the worst recent thing you did

to someone who cared about you?

</line>


<line>
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?

-Both.

</line>


<line>
Can you keep it down, please?

Some people are trying to sleep.

</line>


<line>
-We are keeping it down.

-We've been really quiet.

</line>


<line>
-You're basically shouting.

-Sorry.

</line>


<line>
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?

-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

</line>


<line>
No, because then I'll hear the

"psst, psst, psst."

</line>


<line>
And I'll be up all night

wondering what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what would we be talking about?

-Yeah, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
What would we be talking about?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

</line>


<line>
Forget it. Can't sleep here.

I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.

</line>


<line>
[sighing]

</line>


<line>
-Freeze, candy ass.

-[gasping]

</line>


<line>
-Character Actress Margo Mart--?

-I said, "Freeze."

</line>


<line>
[The Closer] <ital>Hold on. Are you telling me</ital>

<ital>esteemed character actress</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale</ital>

<ital>has been living in your boat?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Is this one of those situations where

everything we discuss is confidential,

due to customer

service rep-client privilege?

</line>


<line>
Of course.

</line>


<line>
Then yes,

Margo Martindale is living in my boat.

</line>


<line>
-How long have you been in here?

-Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.

</line>


<line>
[yelling]

</line>


<line>
-[moaning]

-Eh...

</line>


<line>
Well, Margo, old gal,

looks like you've bought yourself

another day of freedom.

</line>


<line>
But at what cost?

</line>


<line>
I knew I had to lay low.

Go off the grid, disappear.

</line>


<line>
I know what "lay low" means.

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, I disappeared for a little bit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Somewhere I knew I had no chance</ital>

<ital>of being discovered--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>regional theater.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I did a run at the La Jolla Playhouse</ital>

<ital>in an obscure Tennessee Williams play.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I have ambition, sir.

</line>


<line>
Dreams that don't incorporate

the concerns of cynics like you.

</line>


<line>
Cynic.

Always laughing that terrible laugh.

</line>


<line>
-Ramona...

-Well, go ahead and laugh.

</line>


<line>
Laugh your life away. I can laugh, too.

</line>


<line>
[laughing]

</line>


<line>
Ramona, I'm telling you...

</line>


<line>
[wailing]

</line>


<line>
She's dead.

</line>


<line>
[applause]

</line>


<line>
<ital>I was good. Too good.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The </ital>San Diego Union-Tribune

<ital>called me, "A talent to watch."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I knew I had to get out of there.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And you've been living here ever since?

</line>


<line>
That's right. I also did an arc

on <ital>The Good Wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Other than that, laying low.

-<ital>The Good Wife?</ital>

</line>


<line>
How did you go on a nationally broadcast

TV show with no one catching you?

</line>


<line>
I disappeared into the role, BoJack.

It's called acting. Try it sometime.

</line>


<line>
And you're the one

who's been stealing our food.

</line>


<line>
You already know too much.

</line>


<line>
Smoke bomb.

Hi-yah!

</line>


<line>
-Why did you throw a plum on the floor?

-Thought it was a smoke bomb.

</line>


<line>
Where are my smoke bombs?

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.

</line>


<line>
-Hey. BoJack's back.

-Yup.

</line>


<line>
My two favorite people

in a room together with me.

</line>


<line>
-You bet.

-Isn't this great, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
-The three of us under one roof?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
It's like <ital>Three Men and a Baby.</ital>

</line>


<line>
But there's only two men,

and the baby's a lady.

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
[yawning]

</line>


<line>
[chattering]

</line>


<line>
[sighing]

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>With all this turmoil and upheaval,</ital>

sure would be nice to have

something you can depend on.

</line>


<line>
Something that arrives every day

at your doorstep,

with a robust arts section.

</line>


<line>
Let me tell you something

about the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I don't think you finished the story</ital>

<ital>about your publicist.</ital>

</line>


<line>
What happened when you told her

you wanted to know her?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right. Well...

</line>


<line>
If we're gonna work together

and also have weird kinky car sex,

</line>


<line>
I wanna know something about you.

</line>


<line>
What do you wanna know?

</line>


<line>
I was married once.

I have a son I'm not allowed to see.

</line>


<line>
-My favorite fruit is honeydew.

-Gross, is that true?

</line>


<line>
Does it matter?

</line>


<line>
Listen, I've been

with guys like you before,

and I know this thing works better

if we keep a little distance.

</line>


<line>
And...

[grunting]

</line>


<line>
-[groaning] Well, that worked.

-Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>So, that's how you left things?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>That's how she left things.</ital>

<ital>But then I followed her home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>You did what?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>She lives in this</ital>

<ital>tiny apartment in the Valley.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I could see her through the window</ital>

<ital>and I just watched her being... normal.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh!

[sighing]

</line>


<line>
[The Closer]

<ital>There's something very intimate</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>about watching a person be herself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>But it wasn't good intimate,</ital>

<ital>like when you see your mom cry.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It was bad intimate,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>like when your dad writes a poem</ital>

<ital>about Lena Horne's nipples,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>makes you read it out loud</ital>

<ital>so he can hear if it scans.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[The Closer] <ital>She warned you</ital>

<ital>that you wouldn't want to know her.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>Yeah. She was right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's so sad that when you see someone</ital>

<ital>as they really are, it ruins them.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Do you have someone you can talk to?

-About what?

</line>


<line>
<ital>These feelings you have,</ital>

<ital>your self-destructive behavior.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You know that old joke

about how many psychiatrists

does it take to screw in a light bulb?

The answer is just one,

but the light bulb has to want to change?

</line>


<line>
-I don't know that joke.

-That's it. That's the whole joke.

</line>


<line>
The light bulb has to want to change.

</line>


<line>
[laughing]

Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's actually not the point of the joke.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey. I need to talk to you.

-What the... I'm on the phone.

</line>


<line>
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award

from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's too much heat.

</line>


<line>
I'm taking your boat out

to international waters.

</line>


<line>
You never saw me.

</line>


<line>
On the phone.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to talk to anybody.

</line>


<line>
What I want is to have control

over my own life.

</line>


<line>
[engine starting]

</line>


<line>
Which is why I'm begging you

to please cancel my delivery

of the <ital>L.A. Gazette.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I don't think you want to do that.

-I promise you I do.

</line>


<line>
No, because that's just theater.

</line>


<line>
It allows you to think you're in control,

but the whole idea of control is a myth.

</line>


<line>
The universe is a wild beast.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You can't tame it.</ital>

<ital>All you can do is try to live inside it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Live inside the beast?

That's a mixed metaphor.

</line>


<line>
-But... you're right.

<ital>-Great.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I'm going to sign you up

for another six months.

</line>


<line>
Since you've been such a sport,

I'm throwing in a tote bag.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

You've given me a lot to think about.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so I'm a passenger.

</line>


<line>
Remember the three D's:

drive safely, drive efficiently,

and don't harass the passenger.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?

-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

</line>


<line>
-[imitating car braking]

-[imitating opening door]

</line>


<line>
-Can I talk to you alone?

-Of course.

</line>


<line>
Driver, put up the partition, please.

</line>


<line>
[imitating partition whirring]

</line>


<line>
I've been thinking,

and you should do this without me.

</line>


<line>
What? But the whole point

is we're doing it together.

</line>


<line>
But you don't need me anymore.

</line>


<line>
You have a whole team of coders,

and I don't think that I can work

in this house.

</line>


<line>
-What's wrong with the house?

-Todd, I just--

</line>


<line>
-I need to go.

-[imitating opening door]

</line>


<line>
I don't understand.

</line>


<line>
Did I do something

to make you feel uncomfortable?

</line>


<line>
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

</line>


<line>
BoJack? [sighing]

What did he do this time?

</line>


<line>
I don't think

I've been a very good friend to you.

</line>


<line>
Things happened and...

</line>


<line>
I don't think BoJack's been

a very good friend to you either.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, okay.

-You should buy me out of the company.

</line>


<line>
No, no, no, keep your share.

</line>


<line>
Who knows?

It might be worth something someday.

</line>


<line>
You're sweet, Todd.

</line>


<line>
You shouldn't waste that on people

who don't deserve it.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you want this plum?

I found it in the kitchen.

</line>


<line>
Sure.

</line>


<line>
-[smoke bomb fizzing]

-[both] Whoa!

</line>


<line>
[coughing]

</line>


<line>
Weird plum.

</line>


<line>
[knocking on door]

</line>


<line>
How did you know where I live?

</line>


<line>
-Ana...

-You need to leave.

</line>


<line>
No, I know that it's exciting

to remain mysterious and in control,

but control is a myth.

</line>


<line>
That's a conclusion

I came to recently by myself.

</line>


<line>
I can't do this now.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to go home tonight.

I want to sleep in your bed,

</line>


<line>
I wanna see what

you look like waking up.

</line>


<line>
You are a beautiful,

sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

</line>


<line>
And I want to know you.

I'm not afraid of that.

</line>


<line>
And you don't have to be, either.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
And I want to go with the mirror ads

for <ital>Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, no, listen.

-Ana.

</line>


<line>
This is my campaign,

I know what I'm doing.

</line>


<line>
Call up Turteltaub and tell him

I won't be pushed around on this.

</line>


<line>
I'm the star and what I say goes.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[cars honking]

</line>


<line>
[Ana] Hmm...

</line>


<line>
[Carolyn] It kind of just looks like

a billboard for the sky.

</line>


<line>
-I didn't think this part through.

-No kidding.

</line>


<line>
The sky is Secretariat? The sky

wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

</line>


<line>
It is eerily beautiful.

</line>


<line>
Like an art piece

that resists interpretation.

</line>


<line>
Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad

for my movie to be interpretable.

</line>


<line>
If you stand where I'm standing,

you see a reflection

of the KIIS-FM billboard.

</line>


<line>
Beautiful. So we spent half a million

dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.

</line>


<line>
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.

</line>


<line>
When the sun goes down

and hits that billboard,

that's gonna--

That's gonna be a real problem.

</line>


<line>
Well, the good news is

BoJack got what he wanted.

</line>


<line>
-[sighing]

-[bird screeching]

</line>


<line>
[all gasping]

</line>


<line>
Ugh.
