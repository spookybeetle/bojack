<nonVerbComm>[man on TV]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Can't you see?</ital>

<ital>You don't belong here!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Destiny has bigger plans for you.</ital>

<ital>Oh, yes.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[woman on TV] <ital>But this is my home.</ital>

<ital>-</ital>[rooster crows]

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's the only home I've ever known!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[voices]

-[man]<ital> You were made for the skies.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Why do you think</ital>

<ital>they named you Amelia Earhart?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's because your heart...</ital>

<ital>belongs in the air.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[reciting Amelia's lines]</nonVerbComm>

It's true, that is my name.

</line>


<line>
-Ah! Boots, leave your sister alone!

-She started it!

</line>


<line>
Well, stop it right now

or I'll pop the both of you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, put on those flygirl goggles,</ital>

<ital>get in your biplane and fly to the sun.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[reciting]</nonVerbComm> But a woman's never flown

to the sun before.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Come on! What other gal's</ital>

<ital>got the get-up-and-go</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>to tame those savage sun beasts</ital>

<ital>and become their queen?</ital>

</line>


<line>
How many times

have you watched this tape?

</line>


<line>
When you get me a second tape,

I'll watch something else.

</line>


<line>
What am I, made of tapes?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>That's the spirit!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[reciting]</nonVerbComm> I suppose the most effective

way to do it is to do it!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing, meowing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Hello?

</line>


<line>
How the hell do they expect me to learn

five pages of dialogue in one day?

</line>


<line>
-What am I, Young Sheldon?

-BoJack--

</line>


<line>
No show should have that much talking.

TV is a visual medium.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Anyway, where the hell are you?</ital>

-Eden, North Carolina.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, North Carolina?

That's the second worst of the Carolinas.

</line>


<line>
-You know I'm from here, right?

-Yeah, and you got out.

</line>


<line>
You know what "from" means?

</line>


<line>
You don't have to be there anymore.

That's why they call it "from."

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm about to be

<ital>from </ital>this conversation.

</line>


<line>
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Why did you cast him on this show?

Everybody loves him.

</line>


<line>
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.

I'm Philbert.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh!

-So then I got a food truck for the crew

with a big sign that said,

"From your favorite star,"

but everybody thought

it was from Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
They didn't even read the sign.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
Do you think you can handle your shit

until then?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.

What are you doing there anyway?

</line>


<line>
Just... taking care of some family stuff.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[series theme music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thanks for coming, all this way.

</line>


<line>
-We could've just talked on the phone.

-I wanted to meet you in person.

</line>


<line>
That's the Princess Carolyn difference.

</line>


<line>
Ooh! I've never met a person who had

a difference named after them before.

</line>


<line>
Well, this is important.

We're here to talk about your baby.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're thinking;

another dumb teenager,

so liquored up, she forgot to make sure

her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's all true,

but I'm not some backwoods hick.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me,

</line>


<line>
and it's not like my boyfriend's begging

me to marry him.

</line>


<line>
Boyfriends rarely do.

</line>


<line>
-His name's Strib, short for Dennis.

-Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
He's not exactly the romantic type,

but he's got those eyes

you just can't say no to, you know?

</line>


<line>
I hope you and Strib have

many happy child-free years, together.

</line>


<line>
I'm willing to do whatever I can

to help contribute to the child-free part.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm.

-[phone buzzing, meowing]

</line>


<line>
Oh, sorry. It's work.

</line>


<line>
Everyone I work with is such a baby.

</line>


<line>
And I love babies!

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Hello, baby.

</line>


<line>
Hey, listen, I know Flip

just wants me to be "the woman",

</line>


<line>
and keep my mouth shut,

but this show makes no sense.

</line>


<line>
In the rooftop motorcycle scene,

Fritz and Philbert keep saying,

</line>


<line>
<ital>"This is so dangerous."</ital>

<ital>"Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."</ital>

</line>


<line>
But then they just get off

the motorcycles.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't they skidding

towards the side of the building,

</line>


<line>
and then they roll off just as their bikes

go careening over the edge?

</line>


<line>
Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.

</line>


<line>
Everything I pitch, he shoots down.

</line>


<line>
That's just because it's coming

from someone who isn't him.

</line>


<line>
If you want him to like your idea,

just convince him

he thought of it, himself.

</line>


<line>
You really think he'll do it

because I say it's his idea?

</line>


<line>
That's a great idea, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.

</line>


<line>
-So sorry.

-No problem.

</line>


<line>
Um, just so you know, I have met with

some other candidates, mostly couples.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
I couldn't believe I found someone

who grew up in Eden.

</line>


<line>
-When's the last time you were here?

-Oh, not since my mother died.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I'm sorry.

-It was a long time ago.

</line>


<line>
-She's still dead, though.

-That is true.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sipping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.

-I love Phuzzy's.

</line>


<line>
I bet you got fancy restaurants

in LA, huh?

</line>


<line>
Probably a California Pizza Kitchen

on every corner.

</line>


<line>
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"

since you're in California?

</line>


<line>
No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen,"

or "CPK."

</line>


<line>
CPK? What kind of city person's too busy

to say "California Pizza Kitchen"?

</line>


<line>
You gotta catch a bus or something?

Stay a while and say the whole name.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.

</line>


<line>
I live in Los Angeles now,

but you know what they say,

you can take the girl

out of the Greensboro-High Point

metropolitan area, but you can't take

the Greensboro-High Point

metropolitan area out of the girl.

</line>


<line>
I wish my boyfriend would've taken

his penis out of the girl.

</line>


<line>
-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.

-Yeah, no, I got it.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, have I missed this!

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna eat the shit

out of these hush puppies,

and then tomorrow,

I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,

meaning a sausage patty,

not that bullshit link situation

they call "sausage" in LA.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.

I'll be right back.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts, sighs]

-[phone buzzing, meowing]

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Princess Carolyn!

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to tell you what a ball

I'm having on this crazy cop show.

</line>


<line>
Glad to hear it.

</line>


<line>
And my favorite star paid

for a food truck.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why Peter Scolari is buying

me a falafel plate,

but, hey, I'm not complaining.

</line>


<line>
-Did you have a question?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
So, I know my ex-wife is

in the writers' room.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to make things weird for her

or anybody else, so...

do I have to do all the dialogue,

as scripted,

or can I have a little fun with it?

</line>


<line>
-Um--

<ital>-Normally, I wouldn't even ask,</ital>

but because of the whole<ital> ex-wife</ital>

of it all,

</line>


<line>
I figured I should just double-check

that it's definitely okay

if I change every single word.

</line>


<line>
Knowing Flip,

I would just stick to the script.

</line>


<line>
So, don't flip the script?

</line>


<line>
-Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.

-<ital>That's a double-flip.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So, you're saying I should flip it?

</line>


<line>
I'm saying the exact opposite.

</line>


<line>
-So, flip it. Flip it good.

-Okay, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
You're very funny and talented.

Goodbye. Sorry. Show folk.

</line>


<line>
Well, this was a pleasure.

Thanks for coming all this way.

</line>


<line>
I do hope to make a decision soon.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you have to leave already?

-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.

</line>


<line>
-Your booth?

-At the flea market.

</line>


<line>
I sell clothes I bought cheap

and then bedazzled.

</line>


<line>
I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target

or nothing,

but it's good enough for fleas.

</line>


<line>
Okay, call me if you have

any other questions.

</line>


<line>
I always answer my phone,

day or night.

</line>


<line>
Thanks.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[bell jingles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[water dripping]

-[grunting, sighs]

</line>


<line>
Your mom's drunk again, isn't she?

</line>


<line>
My mom, well, obviously she was planning

on cleaning the floors,

but I asked her if I could do it.

</line>


<line>
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,

so one day,

</line>


<line>
I can be as good a housekeeper

as she is.

</line>


<line>
Why do you still live here?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you go live with your dad

down in Raleigh?

</line>


<line>
All my sisters and brothers are gone.

</line>


<line>
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.

</line>


<line>
Besides, if I go,

who's going to keep you out of trouble?

</line>


<line>
Did you know I'm on the football team?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I do know it.

Are you ever gonna play?

</line>


<line>
Probably not, smart-ass.

</line>


<line>
Not unless the first-string quarterback

gets hurt.

</line>


<line>
Why aren't you

the first-string quarterback?

</line>


<line>
You're not even

first-string housekeeper!

</line>


<line>
Well, how about I first-string punch you

in the nose?

</line>


<line>
Oh! Okay, easy, easy.

</line>


<line>
Look, I think if I just keep my head down

and be patient,

</line>


<line>
Coach will eventually realize

I should be QB one, you know?

</line>


<line>
That's a terrible approach.

</line>


<line>
You need to go after what <ital>you </ital>want.

</line>


<line>
You gotta fly into that sun,

like Amelia Earhart did.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-You know, like in the movie.

</line>


<line>
I never knew anybody who liked old movies

as much as you do.

</line>


<line>
You're 18.

You never knew anybody, period.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
But what if I'm not as good a quarterback

as I think I am?

</line>


<line>
Doesn't matter.

You don't need to be good enough.

</line>


<line>
You just need to convince your coach

you're good enough.

</line>


<line>
Damn! You know what?

</line>


<line>
-I'll talk to him tomorrow.

-Don't leave until you get that yes.

</line>


<line>
-[bell jingling]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Sadie, wait!

-Oh. Um, hey.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I really want to spend more time

getting to know each other.

</line>


<line>
This baby, your baby,

means everything to me.

</line>


<line>
I think the more time we spend together,

</line>


<line>
-you'll realize I'm--

-[phone meowing]

</line>


<line>
-Do you need to take that?

-No, it's fine. The perfect candidate.

</line>


<line>
I thought you always answered your phone,

day or night.

</line>


<line>
Right. Hello?

</line>


<line>
I just got off the phone with Flip.

</line>


<line>
He's really excited about

this new motorcycle stunt he came up with.

</line>


<line>
-He wants to do it tomorrow, but--

-That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.

</line>


<line>
Well, the show is already way over budget

and my boss is starting to ask questions.

</line>


<line>
Now, normally, I love questions

because they're good for pondering,

</line>


<line>
<ital>but I guess in the corporate world,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>when people ask questions,</ital>

<ital>they expect someone to answer them.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And, apparently,

"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"

is not the kind of answer

they're looking for.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, Todd.

</line>


<line>
-<ital>Wait, one more thing.</ital>

-What?

</line>


<line>
Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous

of Lake Superior?

</line>


<line>
Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?

</line>


<line>
We've been through this, Todd.

Lakes don't have emotions.

</line>


<line>
What about Ricki Lake?

</line>


<line>
As I was saying, I'd love to spend

more time together, if you're up for it.

</line>


<line>
You mentioned the flea market.

I'd love to check it out.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.

-I thought it was today.

</line>


<line>
No, no. I just have to prep for it today.

</line>


<line>
But if you can stay another day,

that would be awesome.

</line>


<line>
But only if you can. I know you're busy.

</line>


<line>
I don't want me, or my baby,

to get in the way of your career.

</line>


<line>
Sadie, I'll be there.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Sadie grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[engine starts]

-Toodle-oos! [laughs]

</line>


<line>
-[gasps] Ah! Oh!

-[phone dialing]

</line>


<line>
Stuart, I need you to change my flight.

No, just do it through the website.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, no, go to the website

and put in my confirmation number.

</line>


<line>
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

</line>


<line>
It's 5-2-1-8.

</line>


<line>
Change it to a Wednesday flight.

</line>


<line>
No. Oh, okay, click "yes."

Click "yes."

</line>


<line>
Okay, put in my credit card info.

</line>


<line>
-I'll text you a picture.

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>


<line>
-[phone whooshes]

-Okay, did you get it?

</line>


<line>
Check your work email.

</line>


<line>
Okay, click "accept."

Now forward me the confirmation.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, Stuart.

I don't know what I'd do without you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[deep breath, sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Cooper humming]</nonVerbComm> Ow!

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey, yourself.

</line>


<line>
Well, you've been up to something.

</line>


<line>
I'm up to something, all right.

It's called first-string quarterback!

</line>


<line>
-[cheering]

-Really?

</line>


<line>
-I didn't leave until I got the yes.

-Oh, congratulations! Ah!

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Oops. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-Sorry. I got a little carried away there.

-That's okay.

</line>


<line>
-[kisses] Oh!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
-Sorry. Sorry.

-That's okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laugh]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man on TV]</nonVerbComm> <ital>By Jove, she's doing it!</ital>

<ital>She's flying to the sun!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's where she's going.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now we don't need to be sad</ital>

<ital>when we think about her, later.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[mom snoring, TV playing]

-[switching off TV]

</line>


<line>
-I'd be careful if I were you.

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
Think I don't know what's going on?

</line>


<line>
-Mom.

-Let me tell you something.

</line>


<line>
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's got a number.

Some are winners, some aren't.

</line>


<line>
It all depends

where the little white ball lands.

</line>


<line>
The problem is when people

with losing numbers think they're winners.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what you're talking about.

</line>


<line>
-Then what the hell are these?

-College brochures. I--

</line>


<line>
You think you're going

to some fancy college in California,

all the way on the other side

of the country from your mother?

</line>


<line>
-You're gonna abandon me?

-Mom, it's not about you.

</line>


<line>
UCLA?

No, you will not see LA.

</line>


<line>
Even if you get into one of these places,

how're you gonna pay for it?

</line>


<line>
I'll get a job or a paid internship.

</line>


<line>
Well, la-di-da, I did not realize

I was in the presence of someone,

</line>


<line>
-who was gonna get a paid internship.

-Mom, you need to go to bed.

</line>


<line>
See, that's the difference

between you and me, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
I know where I belong.

This is my bed.

</line>


<line>
No, it's not.

Where's my bed?

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

-[mom, distorted] I know where I belong.

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-<ital>I thought you were gonna be here today.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Where are you?</ital>

-Something came up.

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter's

doing all his own stunts,

and every time he does

a dumb little somersault,

everybody goes nuts

like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.

</line>


<line>
Kerri Strug?

You gotta update your references.

</line>


<line>
When the world sees

the likes of Kerri Strug, again,

</line>


<line>
I will adjust accordingly.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Anyway, I said I wanted to do</ital>

<ital>my own stunts, too,</ital>

but little did I know

that Flip was writing a new scene,

where a motorcycle falls off

a five-story building.

</line>


<line>
Just say you don't want to do it.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I cannot do that</ital>

<ital>because I already fired my stunt double,</ital>

so I also need you to call him

and get him back,

and that might be tricky,

'cause I was really brutal about it.

</line>


<line>
-Why?

-Because people were watching.

</line>


<line>
Now I need you to intervene

and forbid me from doing my own stunts,

even though I want to,

because I actually don't want to,

because that would require me to be

in good shape, which we know I'm not,

and also not a coward,

which we both know I am.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack--

-<ital>Also, if you could say</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>it's because I'm too important a star</ital>

<ital>to take the risk on,</ital>

but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doing

his stunts

because he is less important;

that would be real cool, thanks.

</line>


<line>
Fine, I'll handle it!

</line>


<line>
Just stop whining like a little bitch!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Okay, love you, bitch!

</line>


<line>
-[beep]

-Hey, girl!

</line>


<line>
Hey! I'm so glad you came.

This is my stuff.

</line>


<line>
-I call it Made-y by Sadie.

-Wow!

</line>


<line>
Problem is got a bunch of lookie-loos.

</line>


<line>
Everyone's browsing,

but no one's buying.

</line>


<line>
It's not about people buying.

it's about you selling.

</line>


<line>
Watch this.

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

Hey, you can't get that jacket.

</line>


<line>
-Why not?

-I was gonna get it.

</line>


<line>
It's the best thing in this whole place

and I saw it first.

</line>


<line>
So, why don't you make like yourself

and flee?

</line>


<line>
I got it now.

Maybe I'm gonna buy it.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-Five dollars.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> Oh, my God!

</line>


<line>
Sadie, you can sell anything,

if you just sell people the idea

that they're not being sold to.

</line>


<line>
Wow!

That's pretty manipulative.

</line>


<line>
But I didn't need to

because your clothing sells itself.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I guess you're right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> My back aches.

</line>


<line>
-I gotta sit down.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Here.

-[bear growls]

</line>


<line>
Smart move adopting.

</line>


<line>
Let someone else do all the work, right?

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Girl, you do not wanna be pregnant.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! What am I gonna do?

</line>


<line>
My life's over.

</line>


<line>
No! Are you kidding?

This is a good thing.

</line>


<line>
-That boy's stuck with you, now.

-Stuck with me?

</line>


<line>
No, good stuck,

like when you try on

your friend's fancy ring

and it won't come off.

</line>


<line>
Now you got a free ring.

</line>


<line>
You know, Evelyn still expects you

to give that ring back.

</line>


<line>
That sounds like an Evelyn problem.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, that little white roulette ball

just landed on your number.

</line>


<line>
You know the Wallaces are good people.

</line>


<line>
-They're gonna do right by you.

-[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
No, don't cry. Look.

</line>


<line>
They're gonna have you move

into the big house,

probably in the big room.

</line>


<line>
You know, the one with all the dolls.

</line>


<line>
And I'll be right up here

whenever you need me.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I wanna give you this.

</line>


<line>
Did you steal this from Evelyn, too?

</line>


<line>
Your... grammy gave me this necklace

when I first got pregnant.

</line>


<line>
It's been in our family for generations.

</line>


<line>
It's from the old country.

</line>


<line>
And when you wear this,

</line>


<line>
I want you to remember that you've come

from a long line of women,

who've taken our licks,

but we always land on our feet.

</line>


<line>
-Don't we?

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
Now listen to me. This is our shot.

</line>


<line>
-Don't blow it, okay?

-[sniffles] Okay.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Sadie]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Princess Carolyn?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-Would you want to meet my family?

</line>


<line>
-Of course.

-There's a potluck at the church, tonight.

</line>


<line>
-I love a church potluck!

-Oh! What church do you go to in LA?

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh, St. Mary's Good Shepherd

of the Lady... of the Passion...

of the Constant Gardener...

of Latter-Day Belle and Sebastian.

</line>


<line>
You got time for that, but you can't say

"California Pizza Kitchen"?

</line>


<line>
I love church and I love the Lord.

</line>


<line>
God is my back-door pilot.

</line>


<line>
I wish Strib was a back-door pilot.

</line>


<line>
Maybe then I wouldn't be pregnant.

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-[whispers] Anal sex.

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chatter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
That's my mom. That woman's been banged

more times than a screen door

during hurricane season.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-But I love her.

</line>


<line>
That's my sister Tanya.

</line>


<line>
Thinks she's so smart.

</line>


<line>
If you're so smart, Tanya,

why do you live

on a dry-docked pontoon boat?

</line>


<line>
-Good one!

-She's got a great heart.

</line>


<line>
And, finally, the cousins.

I've slept with all of them.

</line>


<line>
-Wow!

-I'm just kidding.

</line>


<line>
-I'm from North Carolina, not Tennessee.

-[laughing]

</line>


<line>
Hope you like ambrosia, since everyone

brought the exact same dish; ambrosia.

</line>


<line>
Ah, it's beautiful out here.

</line>


<line>
Look at all those stars!

</line>


<line>
-You don't have stars in LA?

-Not like these.

</line>


<line>
Too much light pollution.

</line>


<line>
And heavy pollution.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Princess Carolyn shivering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

My dad's ready to see you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-We better not.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Wallace clearing throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, I gotta tell you, when my idiot son

told me he'd knocked up the help, I...

</line>


<line>
Let me try that again.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

we're going to do the right thing, here.

</line>


<line>
You'll have a lovely wedding

before you start to show.

</line>


<line>
If it's a girl, we'll name her Dorothy

after my mother.

</line>


<line>
Of course, if it's a boy, he'll be

the third Cooper Thomas Rogers Wallace,

so you'll call him Cooper III,

or Cooper Three, Trip, Trey or Lil' Coop.

</line>


<line>
You'll join the Junior League,

maybe sing in the Follies.

</line>


<line>
Mrs. Wallace will teach you

how to play bridge

and destroy other families' social status

through indelicate gossip.

</line>


<line>
-Oh...

-We'll go to Hilton Head every summer

and take a photo of all of us on the beach

wearing khaki and white.

</line>


<line>
This will be our Christmas card.

</line>


<line>
Inside, it will say "Merry Merry"

or "Seasons Greetings,"

so as not to alienate our friends

of other faiths,

but we'll know it's Christmas.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, I know you're scared,

but I promise you,

you've got a great life ahead of you.

</line>


<line>
No worries, no tough choices

and no money troubles,

thanks to the Wallace and Sons

Answering Machine Tape empire.

</line>


<line>
Yes, as long as people need answering

machine tapes, you will be taken care of.

</line>


<line>
-Sound good?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Ah, ah, ah. Wait for the beep.

</line>


<line>
Sound good? Beep!

</line>


<line>
-Yes, sir.

-[phone buzzing, meowing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[back to present time]</nonVerbComm> Hello?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

there's been an accident.

</line>


<line>
BoJack's hurt real bad.

</line>


<line>
Ow! I'm in so much pain.

</line>


<line>
I'm like Kerri Strug over here.

</line>


<line>
Where's my big Russian guy?

</line>


<line>
What happened?

</line>


<line>
-<ital>He fell off a building is what happened.</ital>

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
Are you okay?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I know you're not<ital> okay, okay,</ital>

but you're<ital> okay,</ital> right?

</line>


<line>
Why did you let him do his own stunts?

</line>


<line>
-That was today?

-Of course it was today.

</line>


<line>
I put a sticky on your day page

at our sister site

</line>


<line>
WhatDateIsItRightNow.net.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

<ital>-Do you even check your day page?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Every part of me hurts.

Sartre was wrong.

</line>


<line>
Physical pain is so much worse

than prolonged emotional distress.

</line>


<line>
What a hack!

</line>


<line>
We're supposed to be shooting, all week.

You're behind schedule and over budget.

</line>


<line>
I'm sending you the number

of a specialist.

</line>


<line>
He can fix BoJack up

and inject him full of enough pep

to keep things together

until end of production.

</line>


<line>
-Sadie!

-[mother] No, no, no, no, Strib!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sister]</nonVerbComm> Go away!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-So I call this number--</ital>

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Strib, what are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I guess I was wrong, maybe.

Maybe you don't give the baby away.

</line>


<line>
Like, maybe keep it.

I mean, I guess I could marry you.

</line>


<line>
Have a family and stuff. I don't know!

</line>


<line>
A grand gesture?

This is like a fairy tale!

</line>


<line>
Strib, I can't do this again.

</line>


<line>
-Come on. I love you or whatever.

-Go to him, Sadie. He loves you.

</line>


<line>
Don't listen to her, Sadie.

She lives in a pontoon boat.

</line>


<line>
Y'all gonna be beggin' for a ride

when the flood comes.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God.

-Somebody gotta get him outta here.

</line>


<line>
-[people arguing]

-Hey! Sadie? Sadie.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[voices overlapping]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You blew it!

We were this close, and you blew it.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] Mom.

-What the hell happened?

</line>


<line>
You eat a pineapple or something?

Put something up there you shouldn't have?

</line>


<line>
No. It just--

I don't know, it just happened.

</line>


<line>
Miscarriages don't "just happen."

This was our ticket.

</line>


<line>
That baby would've changed

everything for us.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobs]</nonVerbComm> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
We just got losing numbers.

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe Cooper will marry me, anyway?

</line>


<line>
Oh, sweetie, you've been watching

too many of those old movies.

</line>


<line>
Coopers don't marry gals like you.

</line>


<line>
He's gonna end up with some fancy heiress,

like Samantha Floppy-Disk.

</line>


<line>
Besides, you don't want that life.

</line>


<line>
-You're free now.

-Free to do what?

</line>


<line>
I wasn't gonna tell you,

but this came in the mail.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing, meowing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-I guess you heard about BoJack?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-This is all my fault.

</line>


<line>
I thought the stunt was Flip's idea.

</line>


<line>
Well, no, I just convinced him

it was his idea.

</line>


<line>
That's not what I heard.

I heard it was Flip's idea.

</line>


<line>
-Right, but that's just--

-It was Flip's idea.

</line>


<line>
How are you not getting this?

</line>


<line>
Do you only seem smart

because you wear glasses?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Okay, it was Flip's idea.

</line>


<line>
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Listen, I've known me some Stribs.

A little sweet, a little dangerous.

</line>


<line>
But the second things get complicated,

he'll run away.

</line>


<line>
-You don't know my Strib.

-But I know you. And you are too special

to settle for the first guy

who rolls up on a motorcycle

and says, [drawls]

"I love you or whatever."

</line>


<line>
Well, I haven't decided

what I'm gonna do yet anyway.

</line>


<line>
You're a bright girl,

and you've got an incredible future.

</line>


<line>
Let me ask you something.

Did you really like the clothes I made?

</line>


<line>
Of course I did.

</line>


<line>
Then why didn't you buy anything

for yourself?

</line>


<line>
-Sadie...

-You're bullshitting me.

</line>


<line>
-This is just another sale for you.

-No.

</line>


<line>
You think I'm stupid,

but I've been watching you bullshit,

everyone on that phone of yours.

</line>


<line>
I want to give your baby the best life,

the best schools, the best opportunities--

</line>


<line>
You think, because you left her,

you're better.

</line>


<line>
Because of your fancy show business,

you can take whatever you want.

</line>


<line>
-No, no, no, you don't understand.

-Well, I got something you can't have,

and no amount of your managing

or producing is gonna change that.

</line>


<line>
I just want to help you.

I want to give your baby a better life.

</line>


<line>
Better than what?

</line>


<line>
Better than a sky fulla stars?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[deep breath]</nonVerbComm> Okay, Sadie,

you do whatever you want.

</line>


<line>
You want to keep the baby,

you want to give the baby

to someone else, fine.

</line>


<line>
Just do, what <ital>you </ital>want to do.

</line>


<line>
Don't live your life for Strib,

or this baby, or anybody else.

</line>


<line>
-I know that.

-Okay. Good.

</line>


<line>
-Thank you.

-I mean it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sign grinds]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
So, I just got the word from Sadie.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-She's gonna keep looking.</ital>

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! I'm sorry.

This is the hardest part of my job,

</line>


<line>
<ital>when I have to lie to the clients</ital>

<ital>and tell them it's not their fault.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Thank you, Tracy.

-It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
-Goodbye, Tracy.

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
-[chattering]

-[planes landing and taking off]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing, meowing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I am so sorry.

This was all my fault.

</line>


<line>
Uh, it's your fault I feel amazing?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what that doctor gave me,

but, man, you should leave town

more often.

</line>


<line>
Hey, quick question... is this a train?

</line>


<line>
I'm on my way home.

</line>


<line>
I'll come check on you

as soon as I get there.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm golden. Let me tell you.

</line>


<line>
You accidentally drive a motorcycle

off a building,

and suddenly

you are everybody's favorite guy.

</line>


<line>
We did it, Princess Carolyn. Back on top!

</line>


<line>

-<ital>This is the final call for boarding.</ital>

-[mom grunts]

</line>


<line>
Okay. Bye, Mom. Ooh!

</line>


<line>
Hey, I got a nutty idea.

What if you deferred for a year?

</line>


<line>
Mom, I-I can't do that.

</line>


<line>
Of course you could.

Los Angeles isn't going nowhere.

</line>


<line>
Just another year.

</line>


<line>
By that time, Boots will be out of rehab,

and he can come home, and help out.

</line>


<line>
-Just wait until then.

-Mom, please.

</line>


<line>
A year. You'll hardly notice it.

</line>


<line>
-No, Mom. I gotta go.

-Please?

</line>


<line>
Can't you just do this one thing for me?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, Mom.
