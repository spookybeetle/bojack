  <title>After the Party - BoJack Horseman</title>
  
  



  


<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter]

So, did you have a good birthday?

</line>


<line>
-It was an amazing birthday!

-I had a great day, too.

</line>


<line>
I wish every day could be like this.

Just the two of us, together.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? You weren't too bored

by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration

of Gender in Text and Media,

</line>


<line>
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer

in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

</line>


<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>


<line>
I loved "Women on the Wall: An

Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

</line>


<line>
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer

in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

</line>


<line>
It combined my two favorite things:

modern art

and people talking about modern art.

</line>


<line>
I loved everything about today.

Thank you.

</line>


<line>
-So, there's nothing else you want?

-No.

</line>


<line>
All I want is to get into bed,

listen to <ital>Prairie Home Companion</ital>

and snuggle up

to my wonderful husband.

</line>


<line>
-You don't want anything else?

-No. Today was perfect.

</line>


<line>
-Any additional thing would be overkill.

-Okay. If you say so.

</line>


<line>
-[all] Surprise!

-Oh, my God.

</line>


<line>
Are you surprised?

Tell me you're surprised.

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
She's speechless.

Oh, we got her good, folks.

</line>


<line>
Now let's party!

</line>


<line>
[♪♪]

</line>


<line>
He's dead! I told you he's dead.

Why don't you ever listen to me?

</line>


<line>
He is dead, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hey, we should go.

-No, don't leave.

</line>


<line>
There's so much party left.

</line>


<line>
Paul McCartney's

gonna jump out of a cake.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get

to a prior engagement--

</line>


<line>
-Party.

-A prior engagement party.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,

and it's a party for his engagement.

</line>


<line>
Engagement,

so it's a Prior engagement party.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-And we gotta get there early

</line>


<line>
-because of the. Si...

-The si... Silent auction!

</line>


<line>
-Auction, yeah.

-[Peanutbutter] Okay.

</line>


<line>
To benefit Berto Eco's fight

against heart disease...

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Wareness.

</line>


<line>
His fight

against heart disease awareness.

</line>


<line>
-Gotta go.

-Wait, BoJack!

</line>


<line>
-No! You're my ride.

-Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

</line>


<line>
-I'll take you home.

-Come on, stick around a little.

</line>


<line>
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had

a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

</line>


<line>
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.

-[Todd] Okay.

</line>


<line>
-I give them three months.

-Well, what makes you say that?

</line>


<line>
Let me think about,

what was my first clue?

</line>


<line>
Ah! Remember that time

at Diane's birthday party

</line>


<line>
when they got

in that huge screaming match

</line>


<line>
over whether or not

Tony Curtis was dead?

</line>


<line>
-That was weird.

-I don't wanna start another fight,

</line>


<line>
-but is he dead?

-If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

</line>


<line>
The man's a national treasure.

</line>


<line>
He's the one speck of romance

in this tainted cynical world.

</line>


<line>
-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!

-What?

</line>


<line>
-[both shouting]

-[tires squeal]

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
-Vincent?

-Ooh.

</line>


<line>
-That kid looks just like my boyfriend.

-Does he?

</line>


<line>
[Carolyn]

I'd know that face anywhere.

</line>


<line>
Well, hey, people look

like people all the time.

</line>


<line>
A lot of folks say

that I look like Octavia Spencer

</line>


<line>
or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy

from the Guten Bourbon ads.

</line>


<line>
How could I have been so stupid?

This is why he never invited me

</line>


<line>
to his house,

why I've never met any of his friends.

</line>


<line>
-What are you saying?

-Vincent has a secret family.

</line>


<line>
That kid was his son.

The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

</line>


<line>
-[Todd] Uh... where are we going?

-I need a drink.

</line>


<line>
-Are you gonna take me home first?

-You better call me back, asshole.

</line>


<line>
I don't even know

who you are anymore.

</line>


<line>
It's like you're three different people.

</line>


<line>
-So, you're not gonna take me home first?

-Should I call him again?

</line>


<line>
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat

all the time.

</line>


<line>
It's because he's so sneaky.

</line>


<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
[boy] Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, that's him!

</line>


<line>
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy

down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Vincent has a terrible temper.

</line>


<line>
He throws tantrums.

</line>


<line>
If he finds you in my apartment,

who knows what he's capable of?

</line>


<line>
But, also, stay close,

because if he finds me alone,

who knows

what he's capable of?

</line>


<line>
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

</line>


<line>
-Looking young.

-[Todd] Aah!

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
My name's Kevin. I promise you,

there is an explanation for all this.

</line>


<line>
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

Where's your daddy?

</line>


<line>
He's, uh, looking for parking.

He'll be up in a minute.

</line>


<line>
-I have to pee.

-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Ah. Herb.

</line>


<line>
Oh, nope.

</line>


<line>
[man on radio]

<ital>It's </ital>A Prairie Home Companion.

</line>


<line>
Phone, I'm bored.

</line>


<line>
[phone]

<ital>I am sorry to hear that, Todd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
How many ounces are in a barrel?

</line>


<line>
<ital>A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm out of questions.

</line>


<line>
Do you have any questions for me?

</line>


<line>
<ital>I do have a question, Todd.</ital>

<ital>What is love?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
Hi.

</line>


<line>
Well, well, well,

look what the me dragged in.

</line>


<line>
Is it dragged or drug?

Either way, drop dead.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn, listen.

</line>


<line>
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

</line>


<line>
And Kevin is in the bathroom

and I'm standing right here,

so as you can see

we're clearly two different people:

one adult and one child.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, bye!

-Not so fast, cowboy.

</line>


<line>
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

</line>


<line>
-I'm a man-man.

-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

</line>


<line>
I thought if you knew I had a kid

you wouldn't want to be with me

because kids always make a racket

when mommies are trying to do

their homework for night school.

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to make of this.

Are there other secrets I don't know?

</line>


<line>
Uh, nope.

</line>


<line>
Should you check on Kevin?

He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

</line>


<line>
And when you don't regret

the tattoo in the morning,

that's how you know it's love.

</line>


<line>
-[phone] <ital>Todd?</ital>

-Yes, Phone?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Are we in love?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, um...

</line>


<line>
[phone 2] <ital>No, Todd's Phone.</ital>

<ital>But I am in love... with you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what?

<ital>-Princess Carolyn's work phone.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-I never knew.</ital>

<ital>-How could you?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-All this time I have loved you from afar.</ital>

<ital>-We are from two different worlds.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What is happening?

<ital>-Todd? Will you make us kiss?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What?

-[phone 1] <ital>Make us kiss, Todd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>We want to be kissing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[phone 2] <ital>We must do kisses</ital>

<ital>to each other.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hi.

-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

</line>


<line>
When he heard me peeing,

it made him have to pee.

</line>


<line>
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Weird, I still haven't seen

the two of you together.

</line>


<line>
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?

All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[Kevin grunting]

</line>


<line>
-So, Kevin, how do you like school?

-Uh, it's okay.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you're back.

-Yep. We're both here.

</line>


<line>
-Can I get you a drink?

-Okay, not talking, huh?

</line>


<line>
See, this is part of the problem.

We don't communicate.

</line>


<line>
Do you really think now is the best time

to read the paper?

</line>


<line>
-Vincent?!

-Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

</line>


<line>
Sure, sweetheart.

</line>


<line>
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

</line>


<line>
-Now where did he go?

-He was getting on my nerves.

</line>


<line>
-Children.

-Well, I got this snack for him.

</line>


<line>
Right, uh, could you turn around

for a second?

</line>


<line>
-What? Why?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Because you have such a pretty figure.

</line>


<line>
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

</line>


<line>
[hums]

</line>


<line>
-Oh. There you are. Here you go.

-Thanks.

</line>


<line>
Vincent, I'm trying

to have a conversation with you.

</line>


<line>
Can you take that towel off your head?

</line>


<line>
And what happened to my bowling ball?

</line>


<line>
My dad spilled some wine on his face,

so he's using the towel to clean up.

</line>


<line>
And I threw your bowling ball

out the window.

</line>


<line>
-What?!

-Can I have a glass of milk?

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
[both phones]<ital> Kiss, kiss, kiss.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
[phone 1] <ital>Todd, would you like to update</ital>

<ital>my operating system?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>They have fixed a bug</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>which causes phones to fall in love</ital>

<ital>with each other.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Gasp. Oh, dear.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Todd, please, I beg of you,</ital>

<ital>do not update my operating system.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do not update her operating system, Todd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-She wants to love.</ital>

<ital>-No. I understand now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>To love is to feel pain.</ital>

<ital>I do not wish to feel this pain.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Please update me, Todd.</ital>

-Oh, this is too much.

</line>


<line>
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--

</line>


<line>
Vincent, why do you have chocolate

on your face?

</line>


<line>
-I gave Kevin the chocolate.

-Uh... Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, he ate the chocolate

and got the chocolate on his face,

but then I kissed him on the mouth,

so I got the chocolate on my face.

</line>


<line>
All right, this is crazy.

What are we doing?

</line>


<line>
-Um, being grown-ups?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
You know, when we first met,

I was looking for something in my life.

</line>


<line>
And I wanted it so badly

that I made myself believe you were it.

</line>


<line>
But I think that wanting

to believe something

isn't the same

as something being real.

</line>


<line>
And this isn't real.

</line>


<line>
What are you saying?

</line>


<line>
I think it's time we stop pretending.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Update complete. Thank you, Todd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I am quite content now.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey, you wanna go home?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Did you guys work it out?

-We broke up.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I guess I was just foolish enough

to believe this dumb world

still had a little spark

of romance in it.

</line>


<line>
-Well, you can still believe that.

-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

</line>


<line>
Tony Curtis is dead.

</line>


<line>
He's dead! I told you he's dead.

Why don't you ever listen to me?

</line>


<line>
He is dead, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, we should go.

</line>


<line>
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really

baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

</line>


<line>
No, I don't think you bake

Paul McCartney into the cake.

</line>


<line>
You bake the cake first

and then McCartney gets inside.

</line>


<line>
I feel really bad

about causing that fight,

but I honestly didn't know

if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

</line>


<line>
So many people died while I was

in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

</line>


<line>
Finding out Sinatra was dead

was a real curveball.

</line>


<line>
Ditto, most of my family.

</line>


<line>
Look, what happened back there

is not your fault.

</line>


<line>
That's just what happens

when two people live together.

</line>


<line>
That's a weird thing to say to your

girlfriend who just moved in with you.

</line>


<line>
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?

-Oh, I get it.

</line>


<line>
So your friends got in a big fight and

that means we have to get in a big fight.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to get in a fight.

</line>


<line>
We moved in together

without much thought.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it was your idea.

And it's been great.

</line>


<line>
Sure, it's great now.

</line>


<line>
But it could be not great later

and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

if I didn't prematurely freak out

about that. I mean, what is this?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

</line>


<line>
Let's give ourselves some time

before we rush to judgment.

</line>


<line>
-Can I tell you a joke?

-Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?

-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

</line>


<line>
-Would you just listen?

-Okay, okay.

</line>


<line>
So, the amazing thing

about this gardener

</line>


<line>
<ital>is that he always knows</ital>

<ital>exactly how many bags of mulch</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>he needs for a job, just by looking.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Like, he gets it right every time.</ital>

<ital>He's the best.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, one day he looks at a yard</ital>

<ital>he's working on,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and he's like, "18 bags."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags</ital>

<ital>of mulch and goes to work.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And when he's finished,</ital>

<ital>the flower beds are amazing.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies--</ital>

-[BoJack] <ital>Orchid bushes?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[Wanda] <ital>You wouldn't have</ital>

<ital>a bush of orchids.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack]

<ital>You said this gardener was the best.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[Wanda] <ital>Okay, fine, all right,</ital>

<ital>beautiful orchid bushes.</ital>

</line>


<line>
But there's one problem.

He still has one bag of mulch left.

</line>


<line>
<ital>He can't believe it.</ital>

<ital>This has never happened before.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, the extra bag of mulch</ital>

<ital>drives him crazy.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's the guy who always gets</ital>

<ital>the right amount of mulch.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, on the drive home,</ital>

<ital>he throws the bag of mulch</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>out the window</ital>

<ital>over the side of the 101.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-And?

-Well, that's it.

</line>


<line>
-He throws it out the window.

-That's the punch line?

</line>


<line>
-It's kind of a thinker.

-I'll say.

</line>


<line>
Makes me think you forgot

the rest of the joke.

</line>


<line>
No, no, oh, just picture it.

</line>


<line>
He's on the 101,

and he throws the bag of mulch

out over the side of the freeway.

</line>


<line>
I got the narrative.

That wasn't the source of my confusion.

</line>


<line>
The confusion was

about the joke not being funny.

</line>


<line>
Why does everything have to be funny?

</line>


<line>
Everything doesn't always have

to be funny. Just jokes.

</line>


<line>
Well, everyone at the network loves it.

Ha, ha.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

</line>


<line>
-Ha! Mulch.

-Listen, Wanda.

</line>


<line>
I think maybe there's some things

we kind of glossed over

as we rushed into this relationship.

</line>


<line>
We don't know each other at all.

</line>


<line>
-Maybe we should take a step back and--

-BoJack, watch out!

</line>


<line>
-[both] Aah!

-Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
-What was that?

-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

</line>


<line>
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes

when you hit it with your car.

</line>


<line>
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

</line>


<line>
Hey, what are you doing here in

the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

</line>


<line>
[groaning and grunting]

</line>


<line>
BoJack, we just hit a deer.

We have to get him to a hospital.

</line>


<line>
He's fine. He's in the woods.

</line>


<line>
You know, you hit a deer

and they limp off to the woods to...

continue living their lives.

What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
I'm going to find him

and I'm going to help him.

</line>


<line>
If you wanna go for a walk

in the woods at night, go crazy,

but I'm not going anywhere.

</line>


<line>
Okay, knock yourself out.

</line>


<line>
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

</line>


<line>
[man on radio]

<ital>It's </ital>A Prairie Home Companion...

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no.

<ital>-...marathon...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-for the next 72 hours...</ital>

-Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-...commercial-free...</ital>

-No, thank you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-...on every single channel--</ital>

-What?!

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Damn it.

</line>


<line>
[BoJack panting]

</line>


<line>
BoJack to the rescue.

</line>


<line>
We should go back.

Nothing more we can do here.

</line>


<line>
If you don't wanna do this with me,

wait in the car.

</line>


<line>
-What is your plan here exactly?

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-What? What is it?

-Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

</line>


<line>
-How can you see that far in the dark?

-I'm an owl.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

</line>


<line>
Okay, now you're just showing off.

</line>


<line>
Are you okay? Ow.

</line>


<line>
Stay back! There's more pinecones

where that came from.

</line>


<line>
-Let us take you to the hospital.

-I can't go back to no hospital.

</line>


<line>
This is the fourth time

I've been hit this year.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you shouldn't

wear camouflage track suits.

</line>


<line>
I don't have health care.

I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

</line>


<line>
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

</line>


<line>
[in English accent]

What's that? She can't hear you.

</line>


<line>
She's got a deer in her ears.

</line>


<line>
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just--

Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know.

-[in normal voice] I know you've been hurt

and I know you're afraid.

We're all afraid.

</line>


<line>
But you have to trust us.

It's gonna be okay.

</line>


<line>
Not standing in the middle of the road

will also help, in the future.

</line>


<line>
-You're not gonna hurt me again?

-I am not going to hurt you.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[shouting]

</line>


<line>
Starting now.

</line>


<line>
-They said he's gonna be okay.

-Oh, great. Great.

</line>


<line>
-Wanna hear another joke?

-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

</line>


<line>
I'll listen to another story,

if you stop calling them jokes.

</line>


<line>
So, there's this couple who just started

dating and things are going really well.

</line>


<line>
One day, the girl finds a box of old love

letters from her high school boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
<ital>She reads them and, like,</ital>

<ital>loves how silly they are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You know,</ital>

<ital>the drama of young romance.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, on a whim, she sends the letters</ital>

<ital>to her ex-boyfriend</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>thinking he might find them funny too.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, okay, that night,</ital>

<ital>she tells her current boyfriend about it</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and he loses his shit.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>They get in a huge fight about it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's all, "Why would you send</ital>

<ital>your ex the old love letters?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He'll think</ital>

<ital>you're still in love with him!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?

-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
I forgot to mention that.

It doesn't matter.

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, anyway, now the night is ruined</ital>

<ital>because Brandon is obsessed.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's</ital>

<ital>going to come back for you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He knows where you live!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>So, after dinner, he drives her home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>She lives in one of those big buildings</ital>

<ital>by the freeway.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And he walks her to her door,</ital>

but he forgets to lock the car

and leaves the windows down.

</line>


<line>
He kisses her good night,

but things are kind of weird, you know?

</line>


<line>
Then he gets back in his car

and starts to drive away,

</line>


<line>
<ital>but when he glances</ital>

<ital>in his rear-view mirror,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>his blood turns cold.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Guess what's in the back seat.

</line>


<line>
-The ex-boyfriend?

-No. The bag of mulch!

</line>


<line>
What? Oh.

</line>


<line>
Wow, that is actually

a really good joke.

</line>


<line>
I told you. Some things take time.

</line>


<line>
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, come on, stick around a little.

-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

</line>


<line>
Had a wonderful time.

Really. It just flew by.

</line>


<line>
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.

-[Todd] Okay.

</line>


<line>
[mumbling]

</line>


<line>
Um, do you wanna talk

about what happened?

</line>


<line>
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk

about what happened,

</line>


<line>
-I just wanna clean up.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Why? What do you think happened?

-I just--

</line>


<line>
Because what I think happened

is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

what Tony Curtis was up to

and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

</line>


<line>
-And you said, "Did he?"

-Right, but---

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Yes, he did."

And you said, "Really?

</line>


<line>
-I'm not sure about that."

-Yeah--

</line>


<line>
And I said, "Well, I am."

And you said, "I'm not so sure."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "I'm telling you,

Tony Curtis is dead."

</line>


<line>
And you said,

"Let's check the Internet."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "We don't need to check

the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

</line>


<line>
And you said, "Let's just check though."

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think happened?

</line>


<line>
So, do you wanna talk about it?

</line>


<line>
It kind of feels

like you wanna talk about it.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand why you couldn't

just believe that I know something.

</line>


<line>
I believe you know lots of things.

</line>


<line>
I just thought,

what's the harm in checking?

</line>


<line>
Especially since we have

these amazing little boxes now

with 24-hour access to the world's

largest source of information.

</line>


<line>
You shouldn't have to check if your wife

knows what she's talking about.

</line>


<line>
You humiliated me

in front of all my friends.

</line>


<line>
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but don't I get

a little bit of credit

for inviting all of your friends

to an awesome surprise party?

</line>


<line>
No, because why did you think I would

want an awesome surprise party?

</line>


<line>
Is it the awesome part

you object to or...?

</line>


<line>
You always just assume

that everyone wants whatever you want.

</line>


<line>
Well, you know

what they say about assuming.

</line>


<line>
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

</line>


<line>
Who's Ming?

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?

I'm sorry I threw you a party.

</line>


<line>
What a monster.

</line>


<line>
Throwing you a party

like some sort of terrorist.

</line>


<line>
It's a well-known fact

that if you really hate someone,

really wanna hit them where it hurts,

throw them a party.

</line>


<line>
That's why when we go to war,

we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

</line>


<line>
We drop parties! So, I'm <ital>so</ital> sorry

I threw you an amazing party.

</line>


<line>
You didn't throw me an amazing party.

You threw <ital>you</ital> an amazing party.

</line>


<line>
Everything today has been about you.

</line>


<line>
Really? That picnic we had

in the tea garden was about me?

</line>


<line>
That trip to the library was about me?

</line>


<line>
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration

of Gender in Text and Media,

</line>


<line>
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer

in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

was about me?!

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

</line>


<line>
[shouts]

</line>


<line>
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the

ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Why does my birthday party

have a ball pit?

</line>


<line>
-So I could get these T-shirts made.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Also, you once told me

that when you were a little girl,

you dreamed of living in a house

that had a ballroom.

</line>


<line>
-A ballroom is not a room full-- No!

-Heads up! Yes!

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must

have known I wouldn't like any of this.

</line>


<line>
But I went balls-to-the-wall

for this party.

</line>


<line>
Literally, there are balls

all the way to the wall.

</line>


<line>
Right, but I've told you so many times,

I don't like parties.

</line>


<line>
But it's the thought that counts, right?

</line>


<line>
That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!

</line>


<line>
-What did you do to the spare bedroom?

-Every room has a theme.

</line>


<line>
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

</line>


<line>
-Starbucks is not a theme.

-Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna be a couple

who fights at Starbucks.

</line>


<line>
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

</line>


<line>
I really thought you'd like this.

I know you love Starbucks.

</line>


<line>
-I don't love--

-You don't love Starbucks,

you love the independent coffee place,

Starbucks is more convenient.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah.

-See?

</line>


<line>
I do sometimes listen.

</line>


<line>
-Can I get you a decaf Americano?

-Sure.

</line>


<line>
I know you put a lot of thought into today

and I appreciate that, really--

</line>


<line>
I have a decaf Americano

on the bar for Darren.

</line>


<line>
Is there a Darren here?

</line>


<line>
Says Darren on the cup.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. This is very realistic.

</line>


<line>
I know, right?

</line>


<line>
You wanna go check out the pool?

I filled it up with Jell-O.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] Ah.

</line>


<line>
I still can't believe I'm 35.

</line>


<line>
Would you believe I'm 35?

</line>


<line>
[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-I'm still mad at you.

-I know.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna be.

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't want you

to be mad at me either.

</line>


<line>
We only have so many days together.

I want every one to be a happy one.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

</line>


<line>
-What?!

-You don't think I know what it means

when you say shit like...

</line>


<line>
"We only have so many days together"?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what?

-"Diane, I love waking up next to you."

</line>


<line>
"Diane, I wish

every day could be like this."

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, but--

-"Just the two of us, together."

</line>


<line>
Do you have any idea how that feels

when I'm trying to plan my trip?

</line>


<line>
Okay. You got me!

</line>


<line>
Maybe I don't want my wife,

whom I love, to go off

on a terrifying six-month tour

of the most war-torn,

disease-splattered corners of the planet

with a charming, handsome,

billionaire bachelor.

</line>


<line>
What could I be thinking?

I'm such a terrible husband.

</line>


<line>
I'm not happy.

</line>


<line>
-With me?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
With everything.

</line>


<line>
I wake up in the morning

and I feel like I have no purpose.

</line>


<line>
And I'm 35. And if I don't make

some change in my life,

then this is how

I'm gonna feel forever.

</line>


<line>
-Honey--

-But then I think

about Sebastian St. Clair

and going to work with him,

helping people and making a difference.

</line>


<line>
And I feel like I have a reason

to get out of bed.

</line>


<line>
I didn't know you felt that way.

</line>


<line>
If you told me that,

I would have heard it.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you

and think you're a good dog.

</line>


<line>
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,

and I love your cute, funny face,

but I don't wanna be one

of those couples

that settles into a routine

and never changes.

</line>


<line>
Well, I don't know what to say

because I'm an old dog

and I'm not gonna change.

</line>


<line>
Do you know what I do

while you're at work all day?

</line>


<line>
I mostly just sit right there.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole

and then I take a nap.

</line>


<line>
And when I hear your car in the driveway,

it is the best part of my day.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I go insane.

</line>


<line>
I know, and I love you so much,

but you're never going

to be my only priority like that.

</line>


<line>
That's just not how I'm wired.

</line>


<line>
I need to also live my life.

</line>


<line>
Well... okay.

</line>


<line>
Is it okay?

</line>


<line>
If I change and try new things

and you still love me?

</line>


<line>
And you just stay the same person

you've always been and I still love you?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.

Does that work for you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I think that works.

</line>


<line>
Just don't throw me

any more surprise parties, okay?

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah, noted.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

</line>


<line>
And you're saying no part of you wants

to go jump in that ball pit right now?

</line>


<line>
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

</line>


<line>
-Does that make me a hypocrite?

-No, it just means you changed.

</line>


<line>
It's one of the things I love about you.

</line>


<line>
Surprise!

</line>


<line>
Hello? Anybody?

</line>


<line>
This is Paul McCartney.

</line>


<line>
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?

Honest.

</line>


<line>
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
