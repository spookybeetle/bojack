<line>
Son, did you do your homework?

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna do my homework!

</line>


<line>
What, what, what?

</line>


<line>
-I want Chicken 4 Dayz!

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
[rapper] <ital><music>♪ Oh, it's Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ It's Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ Everybody's having fun</ital>

<ital>At Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I got a drumstick!

-I got a arm.

</line>


<line>
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff!

</line>

<ital><music>♪ Don't ask questions, just keep eating! ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Over at Chicken 4 Dayz,

they pump their chickens

full of hormones

and keep them cooped up

in tiny cages.

</line>


<line>
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

</line>


<line>
Here at Gentle Farms,

we treat our livestock differently.

</line>


<line>
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,

and foosball. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
The chickens here

have wonderful lives

before we harvest them,

so you can eat them.

</line>


<line>
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens?

</line>


<line>
I don't wanna get eaten!

</line>


<line>
Boy, these animals aren't like us.

</line>


<line>
They're specifically bred to be eaten,

and genetically modified

for maximum flavor.

</line>


<line>
<ital>When our chicks first hatch,</ital>

<ital>we lovingly inject them</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>with natural delicious hormones,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>which makes them meat,</ital>

<ital>thereby erasing any moral gray area!</ital>

</line>


<line>
Now you can feel good

about eating our meat.

</line>


<line>
It's simple:

No one knows chicken like chickens.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Gentle Farms.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late?

I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you're driving a car right now.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, right!

-Aah! Oh!

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] Whoa!

</line>


<line>
[tires screech, then crashing]

</line>


<line>
[horn honks]

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
[♪♪]

</line>


<line>
[cawing]

</line>


<line>
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.

</line>


<line>
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

</line>


<line>
-This is my daughter, Irving.

-Your daughter's name is Irving?

</line>


<line>
Gender-normative names

are oppressive.

</line>


<line>
Well, aren't you a little princess?

</line>


<line>
What are you doing

outside of the castle?

</line>


<line>
Mom, your friend is being weird.

</line>


<line>
BoJack is not my friend.

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

</line>


<line>
-Handle her?

-It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.

</line>


<line>
I took my daughter to work,

she got empowered,

</line>


<line>
and now I need you

to take my daughter away from work,

</line>


<line>
so I can actually do some.

</line>


<line>
Mom,

don't pawn me off onto your assistant.

</line>


<line>
Can you not fight me on this,

please?

</line>


<line>
Take my car and my daughter,

and go do whatever it is you do.

</line>


<line>
Way to delegate, captain!

Down low!

</line>


<line>
Nope? Look down.

Just put your eyes down.

</line>


<line>
My hand is below your eye line. No?

</line>


<line>
I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

</line>


<line>
Sounds great, old-woman-o.

</line>


<line>
[cell phone chirps]

</line>


<line>
What is it, BoJack?

I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.

</line>


<line>
Not you, honey!

A different dumb niece.

</line>


<line>
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're not really the kind of person</ital>

<ital>people like.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Right away?

-Uh, sure.

</line>


<line>
But once they get to know me,

they adore me?

</line>


<line>
How do I put this delicately? No.

</line>


<line>
The problem is we haven't gotten

any one-on-one time.

</line>


<line>
There are always other people around.

</line>


<line>
Filming me. Feeding me.

</line>


<line>
Walking me to the garage at night,

because one time I saw a bag

in the wind and I got spooked.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, the only reason

you want Kelsey to like you

is because she's cold and distant.

</line>


<line>
Any time someone tries to love you,

you shove them away.

</line>


<line>
What? No, I don't, stupid.

You're stupid.

</line>


<line>
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I gotta go.

Everyone's staring at me for some reason.

</line>


<line>
What? I'm ready.

Let's take a picture.

</line>


<line>
Hear ye! Hear ye!

</line>


<line>
I call this meeting

of P.B. Livin' to order.

</line>


<line>
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin

who said:

</line>


<line>
"You have reached the end

of your free trial membership

at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.com."

</line>


<line>
-What a wise man.

-What's on the agenda, my frienda?

</line>


<line>
Well, here's an idea.

</line>


<line>
What if there was a West Dakota?

</line>


<line>
Todd, isn't that a job

for the State Department?

</line>


<line>
Well, I got a whole page

of other ideas,

</line>


<line>
each as impractical

as they are prohibitively expensive.

</line>


<line>
You know what they say:

</line>


<line>
"You gotta spend money

to make money."

</line>


<line>
So, how can I spend a lot of money?

</line>


<line>
I know. I'll take a spa day.

</line>


<line>
-Uh--

-Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

</line>


<line>
-We're in a meeting.

-You know what they say:

</line>


<line>
"You gotta skip meetings

to have meetings." See ya.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what should I do?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Oh, maybe you could go

on one of your silly Todd adventures.

</line>


<line>
You know, whatever you do

when everyone is busy with other stuff.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] Okay.

</line>


<line>
[cell phone chirps]

</line>


<line>
What is it, Todd?

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

I need something to do.

</line>


<line>
A job, or a task,

or a direction in life...

</line>


<line>
You're my agent.

Can you give my life meaning?

</line>


<line>
I don't have time for this.

</line>


<line>
Well, don't stop on my account.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

do I have a purpose?

</line>


<line>
Oh, purpose? Are you high?

</line>


<line>
Only the normal amount.

</line>


<line>
I gotta go.

They're about to step on the glass.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Just stay out of trouble.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[clucks]

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
-[horn honks]

-[siren whoops]

</line>


<line>
[sniffing]

</line>


<line>
What I want is a hard target search

of every gas station, backyard,

outhouse, pool house...

</line>


<line>
And can I get a black-and-white cookie,

if it's not too G.D. troublesome?

</line>


<line>
So, we know

the chicken crossed the road.

</line>


<line>
But the real mystery is why?

</line>


<line>
So, what do you want to be

when you grow up?

</line>


<line>
First I'm gonna go to Brown,

</line>


<line>
-then I'm gonna go to Yale Law.

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
Then I'm gonna be

the youngest Supreme Court Justice.

</line>


<line>
-That's great.

-Or, you know, something in marketing.

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
Would you mind

if we stopped by my house?

</line>


<line>
I have to do laundry.

</line>


<line>
So, you just, like, do laundry?

That's, like, your thing?

</line>


<line>
Okay.

This whole attitude you're putting on?

</line>


<line>
I must be Shania Twain,

because that don't impress me much.

</line>


<line>
Is that a reference from the '90s?

</line>


<line>
You know that was 20 years ago, right?

</line>


<line>
Hey, I was just like you

when I was a teenager.

</line>


<line>
I was this badass overachiever

that had these big plans

to change the world.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? What happened?

</line>


<line>
Oh, you didn't hear?

I changed the world.

</line>


<line>
[Todd whistling]

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
Did you have a nice shower?

</line>


<line>
I made you a sandwich.

Oh, but it has turkey in it.

</line>


<line>
Is that kind of weird?

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
[officer] Police!

</line>


<line>
-[Todd gulps]

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
[Todd] Oh, man. [sighs]

</line>


<line>
What seems to be the problem,

Officer...?

</line>


<line>
Fuzzyface.

Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

</line>


<line>
A Chicken 4 Dayz chicken

fell off a truck,

and I gotta find her

and take her to the slaughterhouse.

</line>


<line>
You haven't seen any chickens

running around?

</line>


<line>
No, I don't think so.

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
-Who's this?

-Uh, this is my, uh-- My wife--

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.

</line>


<line>
-Becca Chavez. There she is.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-Yep, she loves her books.

</line>


<line>
Big reader. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-Real nerd.

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

</line>


<line>
Hold on, if you're really a nerd,

who's your favorite

Baroque composer?

</line>


<line>
[clucks]

</line>


<line>
-Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
Yes, I am holding a Bic pen,

but I don't see how that's relevant,

Mrs. Chavez.

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-Sorry. Becca.

</line>


<line>
-[clucking]

-She's a charming woman.

</line>


<line>
I do have to look around a little bit,

just so I can say I did my job.

</line>


<line>
-Uh, don't you need a warrant?

-Only if you're guilty.

</line>


<line>
[both chuckling]

</line>


<line>
Well, in that case,

<ital>mi casa es su casa.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[both chuckling]

</line>


<line>
So, if anyone asks,

you were born in La Jolla.

</line>


<line>
You majored in Communications at USC,

and now you're the booking agent

</line>


<line>
-for Kings of Leon.

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
-Fine, you also book Beck.

-[Diane] Todd?

</line>


<line>
Aah! I didn't find that thing

in your drawer!

</line>


<line>
Why are the police outside?

</line>


<line>
Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped

from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,

and she doesn't speak English,

but she's my best friend

and the cops are looking for her,

and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

and I love her,

and her name is Becca. Chickenson.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, breathe.

-But we can't send Becca back.

</line>


<line>
-They're gonna pump her full of hormones.

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
-More hormones.

-[clucking]

</line>


<line>
I have a plan,

but we gotta get her out of here now.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.

-But she needs our help.

</line>


<line>
Do you know

how much trouble we'd get in?

</line>


<line>
There's a policeman

in our front yard.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh, here comes

the responsible suburban housewife.

</line>


<line>
Gonna do whatever the man says.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
You're right. Let's get out of here.

</line>


<line>
So, now you're just gonna do

whatever a teenage girl says?

</line>


<line>
-Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.

-[clucks]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, or a backbone.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, Becca.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

</line>


<line>
Just me and my wife,

and our teenage daughter and our maid.

</line>


<line>
-What? Why am I a maid?

-Silence, maid!

</line>


<line>
Honey, do you want to sit in the front

or the back?

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-And why not? Maid, you can drive.

</line>


<line>
Hope there's not too much traffic

on the 134.

</line>


<line>
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

</line>


<line>
So long. Have a great day.

</line>


<line>
Wait a second.

The 134 doesn't go to the beach.

</line>


<line>
Unless you took it to the 10.

</line>


<line>
But then why wouldn't you

take the 405 to the 10?

</line>


<line>
Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.

</line>


<line>
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

</line>


<line>
Wait! That man's wife was a...

chicken!

</line>


<line>
[news theme music plays]

</line>


<line>
Fowl run afoul.

A funky chicken has flown the coop,

</line>


<line>
and for a concerned populace,

the sky is falling.

</line>


<line>
Michael Morgan,

Chicken 4 Dayz CEO,

</line>


<line>
this is a public safety hazard,

and your company is responsible.

</line>


<line>
Admit it, you counted your chickens

before they hatched,

and now, those chickens

have come home to roost.

</line>


<line>
Tom, I want to take full responsibility

for this mishap.

</line>


<line>
That's why,

for a limited time, everybody,

</line>


<line>
we are offering

our special Full Responsibility Poppers

at participating restaurants

for only $4.99.

</line>


<line>
Tell me, though, if one sees

this delicious escaped chicken

in the street,

should they approach it, or--?

</line>


<line>
Oh, no. I want to be very clear

that this is not like a friend chicken

you see at school or work.

</line>


<line>
This is a special kind of food chicken

that has lived its entire life indoors.

</line>


<line>
This chicken is not socialized

for the outside world.

</line>


<line>
-Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Tommy.

</line>


<line>
Look, the safest place

for this chicken right now is with us,

so we can kill it,

turn it into a sludge,

and then press that sludge

into a delicious patty.

</line>


<line>
I'd like to take this moment

to apologize

for the earlier crack

about my ex-wife.

</line>


<line>
Shannon, we shared

14 beautiful years together.

</line>


<line>
How do you respond to allegations

that factory farming

is "torture," or "cruel,"

or "like a terrifying movie

about some strange dystopian society,

but in this monster story,

the horrifying monsters are us"?

</line>


<line>
Relax, Tommy,

everything we do

is completely legal and FDA-approved,

so, therefore, it is fine.

</line>


<line>
I have no follow-up questions.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, Todd, what's your plan?

-What?

</line>


<line>
You said you had a plan.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. My plan was:

Ask Diane for help.

</line>


<line>
And now my plan has been completed.

</line>


<line>
Nice follow-through, Todd.

</line>


<line>
We have a 'roided out chicken

and the cops on the lookout.

What do we do?

</line>


<line>
Hey, geniuses,

why don't we take her to Gentle Farms?

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

no one knows chicken like chickens!

</line>


<line>
They couldn't say that in the ad

if it wasn't true.

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

</line>


<line>
[Diane groans]

</line>


<line>
-And cut! Company move to--

-Great news, blue-collar types.

</line>


<line>
Instead of crew lunch today,

your star has arranged

for his favorite burrito truck

to bring you lunch.

</line>


<line>
It's me, I'm that star!

</line>


<line>
[all cheering]

</line>


<line>
We're not breaking for lunch yet.

</line>


<line>
Or we could break for lunch,

and you and I

could get to know each other.

</line>


<line>
The crew has more work to do.

</line>


<line>
Once they've had a burrito,

they'll be off their circadian rhythm--

</line>


<line>
[cell phone rings]

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Los Angeles P.D.

</line>


<line>
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

with a "Reelect Al Gore"

bumper sticker?

</line>


<line>
As relevant today as it was then.

</line>


<line>
Are you aware said Volvo

is currently harboring a fugitive chicken,

along with a teenage girl,

a small, sprite-like man,

and a maid of some sort?

</line>


<line>
That's my daughter!

Not the maid. The other one.

</line>


<line>
I'd wager they're making a run

for Gentle Farms.

</line>


<line>
Don't worry, though.

</line>


<line>
We'll bring your daughter home,

dead or alive.

</line>


<line>
-Alive! Alive!

-We're the L.A.P.D., ma'am.

</line>


<line>
-We'll probably make the right call.

-Wait, wait, wait--

</line>


<line>
All right, troops, listen up!

</line>


<line>
I'm ready to go after these rabble-rousers

with all--

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

</line>


<line>
Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

</line>


<line>
You're a loose cannon,

Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not. I'm a cannon, maybe,

but a loose cannon?

</line>


<line>
Is that what you think of me?

</line>


<line>
I think you play

by your own rules.

</line>


<line>
No way,

he thinks rules were made to be broken.

</line>


<line>
These are all attributes

of a loose cannon.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm just a reckless renegade.

</line>


<line>
-Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon.

-Aah!

</line>


<line>
You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.

</line>


<line>
I'd say Stone's more of a cop on the edge

with nothing to lose.

</line>


<line>
-That's a different thing.

-Now I'm just confused.

</line>


<line>
Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface

a loose cannon or not?

</line>


<line>
All right, put on a pot of coffee.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

</line>


<line>
[Stone groans]

</line>


<line>
Aw, man.

</line>


<line>
So full of burrito. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh, <ital>siesta</ital> time.

</line>


<line>
I need to go. Irving ran off

with a fugitive chicken in my car.

</line>


<line>
We can take my car.

This is perfect.

</line>


<line>
Why is this perfect?

My daughter could be in danger.

</line>


<line>
Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride

to get some one-on-one.

</line>


<line>
I mean, who is BoJack?

</line>


<line>
I'm sure I can find another ride.

</line>


<line>
Every second you waste

finding another ride,

your daughter gets closer to getting

her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

or worse, death,

or slightly better, teen pregnancy,

or worse again, salmonella.

</line>


<line>
Okay, fine. Let's go.

</line>


<line>
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

because we are gonna bond.

</line>


<line>
Up top? Down low?

Either one? Both?

</line>


<line>
[Diane] Oh, wow,

you guys have a movie night here?

</line>


<line>
-[Todd] Oh...

-And we have 20 acres of pasture,

where our chickens have hours

of free play.

</line>


<line>
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

</line>


<line>
[Levi] She sure will.

</line>


<line>
[both] Because no one knows chicken

like chickens.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for saving this poultry

from a terrible life at a factory farm.

</line>


<line>
You're a hero.

</line>


<line>
But what if Chicken 4 Dayz

tries to get her back?

</line>


<line>
Don't you worry about your friend.

</line>


<line>
-That chicken belongs to us now.

-[Diane] Whoa!

</line>


<line>
-Where'd you get that gun?

-You mean originally, or just now?

</line>


<line>
-Just now.

-It was in that barrel.

</line>


<line>
-And what about originally?

-Also that barrel.

</line>


<line>
Look, Becca,

I know this is hard to understand,

but I have to go,

and you can't come with me.

</line>


<line>
[clucks]

</line>


<line>
No, no,

you don't need to book Beck anymore.

</line>


<line>
Now you can just be a chicken.

</line>


<line>
See, this is where you belong, okay?

</line>


<line>
You hear me?

I don't want you no more.

</line>


<line>
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

and I never loved you!

Now get, Becca!

</line>


<line>
I said get!

</line>


<line>
[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
[Becca clucking]

</line>


<line>
She really stretched out that dress.

</line>


<line>
She was so horrified,

she checked into rehab.

</line>


<line>
So, I'm kind of the reason

Drew Barrymore got sober.

</line>


<line>
Did you like <ital>Never Been Kissed?</ital>

If so, you're welcome.

</line>


<line>
Can we have one conversation

that isn't about you?

</line>


<line>
I don't understand

why you need me to like you.

</line>


<line>
I don't need you to like me.

It would be fun if you liked me,

because I'd prove my parents were wrong

to never support me,

because I earned the admiration

of an authority figure,

proving I have intrinsic worth,

but it's not a big deal or anything.

Jeez.

</line>


<line>
Great story. You should put that

in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

</line>


<line>
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

</line>


<line>
It's been screwy since I hit that deer

a couple weeks back.

</line>


<line>
Probably should get it checked out.

</line>


<line>
[tire blows]

</line>


<line>
[both yelling]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Probably should've gotten it checked out.

</line>


<line>
-Those farmers seem nice.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I think Becca will be really happy there.

</line>


<line>
She'll have a nice life.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, until they kill her.

</line>


<line>
Well, yeah, but of all the places

that will eventually kill her,

</line>


<line>
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

</line>


<line>
This doesn't feel right.

</line>


<line>
Becca was our friend.

</line>


<line>
-No. We gotta get her back.

-Uh, what do you mean?

</line>


<line>
Remember when that guy

cocked his gun and said:

</line>


<line>
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

</line>


<line>
He wasn't doing that

because he likes cocking guns.

</line>


<line>
-Then we'll just bust her out.

-Todd, there's nothing we can do.

</line>


<line>
Where else would Becca go?

</line>


<line>
She doesn't even speak English.

</line>


<line>
Well, we gotta do something.

</line>


<line>
Look, I know I'm a screw-up

and all my ideas are terrible,

but with Becca,

I was responsible for something.

</line>


<line>
I had a purpose.

</line>


<line>
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
-[tires screeching]

-[Irving and Todd yell]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God, Diane!

-All right. Let's bust her out.

</line>


<line>
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,

will you get me an iPad?

</line>


<line>
-What? No.

-But I really want an iPad.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

</line>


<line>
Don't push it.

</line>


<line>
All right, all right, we've agreed.

He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

</line>


<line>
-I can live with that.

-Now, you go bust those perps.

</line>


<line>
You'll need a maverick,

a by-the-book rookie,

and a curmudgeonly veteran

one week from retirement.

</line>


<line>
Go, go, go!

</line>


<line>
[men speaking indistinctly]

</line>


<line>
[news theme music plays]

</line>


<line>
We have received word that authorities

are now en route to Gentle Farms

in an attempt to preempt

the pursued poultry at the pass.

</line>


<line>
Do we have a graphic for this? No?

Where's the graphic?

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not gonna go on

until we have a graphic.

</line>


<line>
So, make one. I'll wait.

Yeah, hold on, America,

</line>


<line>
Randy's gotta figure out

how to do his job.

</line>


<line>
Because if I don't have a graphic,

Randy,

people who are just tuning in--

</line>


<line>
Why am I explaining this to you?

This is basic journalistic--

</line>


<line>
I swear to God! We'll be right back!

</line>


<line>
Just got to place the jack

in the right jack apparatus.

</line>


<line>
There, I have got--

</line>


<line>
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

</line>


<line>
That was me acting.

Pretty convincing performance, huh?

</line>


<line>
There's more to me--

</line>


<line>
Are you capable

of experiencing a moment

that you don't then make about you?

</line>


<line>
What was your plan

to get out of here?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

and I'll give him an autograph

for a tow.

</line>


<line>
Boom, his life's changed,

and you and I are on our way.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.

</line>


<line>
The only reason I took this movie

is for her.

</line>


<line>
This is my one shot

at a big studio movie.

</line>


<line>
If I blow it, I'm back to making small,

critically acclaimed movies

about lesbians learning how to recycle.

</line>


<line>
You think I want to be an indie darling?

</line>


<line>
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

</line>


<line>
-Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?

-Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

</line>


<line>
Indie-darling daughters

don't go to Brown, okay?

</line>


<line>
They end up at cute

pat-on-the-back factories like Vassar,

then move back in

with their indie-darling mothers

and make puppet shows

with their tampons,

and they get a profile

in <ital>New York Magazine,</ital>

and the cycle continues.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

and you're not a terrible mother.

</line>


<line>
Hey, aren't you the horse

from<ital> Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
And you're the director

of <ital>Women Who Love Women</ital>

<ital>Who Love Recycling.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Give you a lift

in exchange for a couple autographs.

</line>


<line>
There he is. Right on time.

</line>


<line>
Shh, shh, shh.

</line>


<line>
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta--

</line>


<line>
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>


<line>
[grunting]

</line>


<line>
[wind chimes tinkling]

</line>


<line>
[gong sounds]

</line>


<line>
They probably didn't hear that.

</line>


<line>
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

</line>


<line>
[Levi] Someone broke onto the farm!

</line>


<line>
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

called <ital>Someone Broke Onto the Farm</ital>

and someone just said the titular line?

</line>


<line>
[door opens]

</line>


<line>
[gasps] This way.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Irving, this isn't safe.

</line>


<line>
Get in the car, lock the doors.

</line>


<line>
Don't be a badass

and argue with me--

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, okay, bye!

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
Go, go, go! [panting]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
Becca?

</line>


<line>
Who's making that ruckus

in my chicken coop?

</line>


<line>
[all clucking loudly]

</line>


<line>
-Becca, where are you?

-Becca, are you...?

</line>


<line>
Becca?

</line>


<line>
Is this you?

</line>


<line>
-[clucks]

-Becca?

</line>


<line>
To-- To-- Todd?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I found her! Diane!

This one's Becca!

</line>


<line>
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

</line>


<line>
-They're all Becca.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Okay, go, chickens!

You're free.

</line>


<line>
Go, run to freedom!

</line>


<line>
For generations

they will tell your story!

</line>


<line>
-[Levi] Who goes there?

-Oh, oh, oh, shit!

</line>


<line>
-We gotta hide!

-Go, go, go!

</line>


<line>
[Todd panting]

</line>


<line>
Hide, hide! In here!

Someplace safe.

</line>


<line>
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

</line>


<line>
[clucking]

</line>


<line>
-Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!

-Shh.

</line>


<line>
[Levi] Only we know how to care

for these creatures, you hear?

</line>


<line>
Like I say:

No one knows chicken like chickens.

</line>


<line>
-[cocks gun]

-[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.

-[sighs] It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why

I always get into these messes.

</line>


<line>
You know,

sometimes I feel like my whole life

is just a series

of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

</line>


<line>
I think that's just

what being in your 20s is.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I'm supposed to be the adult here,

and I'm a total mess.

</line>


<line>
You kidding?

You're the coolest person I know.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yeah. You always know what to do,

and you don't take shit from anyone.

</line>


<line>
Is that how you see me?

</line>


<line>
Of course. You're like Lara Croft.

</line>


<line>
In Diane's body.

</line>


<line>
-[Levi cocks gun]

-[Todd whimpering]

</line>


<line>
-This is our chance. Let's go!

-Come on!

</line>


<line>
[Diane] Go, go, go!

</line>


<line>
[all gasping]

</line>


<line>
Please. Take me with you.

</line>


<line>
I hate it here.

I don't want to kill chickens.

</line>


<line>
I want to design video games

that help kids learn math.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
Whoa!

</line>


<line>
I am so sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

</line>


<line>
Let's get out of here!

</line>


<line>
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
[siren whoops]

</line>


<line>
[tires screech]

</line>


<line>
Well, well,

looks like birds of a feather...

go to jail.

</line>


<line>
-[clucking]

-Why was he wearing sunglasses

at night?

</line>


<line>
I hope you folks like community service.

</line>


<line>
-I do.

-What? Oh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, Irving,

thank God you're safe.

</line>


<line>
Mom, I'm fine.

</line>


<line>
Stop embarrassing me

in front of my cool friends.

</line>


<line>
What? Cool?

</line>


<line>
I mean,

that's cool that you think I'm cool.

</line>


<line>
I don't care or anything,

but, you know, it's cool.

</line>


<line>
Hey, this guy.

What'd you get arrested for?

</line>


<line>
-Being too cute?

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
I want to be in his cell.

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles]

-Listen up, everybody.

</line>


<line>
I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman,

have an announcement.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

on account of me being a celebrity.

</line>


<line>
We gracefully accept

the requisite slap on the wrist

and a brief,

but ultimately pointless, trial

in the court of public opinion.

Good day.

</line>


<line>
Well, you are famous,

so you are all free to go.

</line>


<line>
[Stone yells]

</line>


<line>
-But what about Becca?

-Took care of that, too.

</line>


<line>
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,

and she'll pay off Chicken 4 Dayz

to adopt your friend.

</line>


<line>
Does she have a meadow

that Becca can frolic around in?

</line>


<line>
You think Drew Barrymore

doesn't have a frolicking meadow?

</line>


<line>
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

</line>


<line>
I learned something today.

</line>


<line>
When you think

something isn't about you,

you find a way to save the day

and realize that it was,

all along, all about you.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

</line>


<line>
-Hooray!

-Yay! I'm great!

</line>


<line>
So, after all that,

the only thing that saved Becca

was that BoJack was friends

with Drew Barrymore?

</line>


<line>
-Yep.

-So, did anything we did matter?

</line>


<line>
-Nope.

-I think it did.

</line>


<line>
I think we made a difference.

</line>


<line>
A small one, but a difference.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I think we did, too.

</line>


<line>
I think we really changed things

for the better.
