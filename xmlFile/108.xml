  <title>The Telescope - BoJack Horseman</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
[BoJack] <ital>Oh, right.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, just tell whoever,</ital>

<ital>then.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Haaah!

- [tires screech]

</line>


<line>
Ooh!

</line>


<line>
[honks horn]

</line>


<line>
- Asshole!

- [tires squeal]

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu

to see Herb Kazzaz.

</line>


<line>
He has cancer, which,

as you know, is a whole thing.

</line>


<line>
Plus, he hates me,

so I could really use

some good news

at the end of the day.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

You're going to see Herb?

</line>


<line>
You must be really--

Nope.

</line>


<line>
- Don't care. Not interested.

- [phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Okay, Good talk.

</line>


<line>
Hey.

</line>


<line>
- Ready for this?

- Listen.

</line>


<line>
I want to make sure

I don't spend

any time alone with Herb.

</line>


<line>
I'm bringing you

along as my buffer.

</line>


<line>
And your memoirist.

</line>


<line>
I should meet

your old best friend

before he dies of cancer.

</line>


<line>
Fine, I guess.

</line>


<line>
Just don't abandon me.

</line>


<line>
No bathroom breaks.

</line>


<line>
And don't slip out

of the room

to text your fiancé

a bunch of winky smileys

with hearts next to them--

Gross.

</line>


<line>
Congratulations on

the whole being engaged thing,

</line>


<line>
- by the way.

- Thanks.

</line>


<line>
It's just starting

to hit me.

</line>


<line>
I'm getting married.

</line>


<line>
Thank God I don't

have to die alone.

</line>


<line>
- No offense.

- None taken.

</line>


<line>
Till you said, "No offense."

</line>


<line>
So what's the deal with you

and this guy?

</line>


<line>
You never talk about him.

</line>


<line>
Well, I kind of, maybe

stabbed him in the back.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

</line>


<line>
A story of power, betrayal,

and ambitious hairstyles.

</line>


<line>
The year?

198--

</line>


<line>
- Movie's over.

- Watch the next one.

</line>


<line>
Aw, I'm tired

of watching movies.

</line>


<line>
- Do you want to play a game?

- Sure.

</line>


<line>
I spy with my little eye

someone who needs

to shut the hell up.

</line>


<line>
- Is it me?

- It's always you.

</line>


<line>
- Now, where was I?

- You were about to tell

a story about you being

a shitty friend,

but then, we got interrupted

by you yelling at Todd.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

Shut up, Todd.

Why do we need

a kitchen and a bathroom?

</line>


<line>
Pipes are pipes, people.

</line>


<line>
Do we really need

a toilet and a sink

</line>


<line>
and a bathtub and--

Wait, hold on--

</line>


<line>
A whole 'nother room

with another sink?

</line>


<line>
They're all just holes

to the ocean, lady.

</line>


<line>
I mean, come on.

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you're late.

</line>


<line>
Here. I got you a beer.

It's on the house.

</line>


<line>
Don't tell my boss.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, Charlotte,

but one beer gets me tipsy.

</line>


<line>
I got to be clear-headed

for my set.

</line>


<line>
Looks like Herb's killing.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, and the suits

from ABC are here.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Look. They're nodding.

</line>


<line>
That's the executive version

of laughing.

</line>


<line>
Wow. They must be serious

about Herb.

</line>


<line>
That's Angela Diaz.

</line>


<line>
She's the woman who made

pantsuits a thing.

</line>


<line>
Oh, before I forget.

</line>


<line>
Herb and I are gonna see

</line>


<line>
<ital>Back to the Future </ital>again

this weekend.

</line>


<line>
- Want to come?

- I'm in.

</line>


<line>
That movie was amazing,

except for all

the lame time period jokes.

</line>


<line>
We get it.

The '50s were different.

</line>


<line>
I'll have

a New Coke, please.

</line>


<line>
Listen, you guys don't need

to include me on your dates.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes, it makes me feel

like a third wheel.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, stop.

</line>


<line>
Without the third wheel,

</line>


<line>
how would you ride

a tricycle?

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't that make it

a bicycle?

</line>


<line>
Herb Kazzaz,

ladies and gentlemen.

</line>


<line>
[applause]

</line>


<line>
- Hey-ooh!

- Great set, man.

</line>


<line>
It's like everything

you said was something

</line>


<line>
I've thought before but never

had the balls to say.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, BJ.

I set 'em up.

</line>


<line>
Now, you knock 'em down.

</line>


<line>
Let's give it up

for BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
- [applause]

- Well, thank you, Bubbles.

</line>


<line>
I love L.A.

Don't you guys?

</line>


<line>
The prettiest girls in

the world flock to this city,

and they end up

with total knobs.

</line>


<line>
Take this couple,

for example.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Excuse me, miss.

Is that your date?

</line>


<line>
He's my husband.

</line>


<line>
That's your husband?

You can do better.

</line>


<line>
Give me a call

after the show.

</line>


<line>
- [laughter]

- I'm just kidding around.

</line>


<line>
[whispers]

I'm not kidding around.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Maker's Manhattan?

2:00 P.M.?

</line>


<line>
Not judging.

</line>


<line>
That guy tipped me a quarter.

</line>


<line>
That's barely enough money

to buy three gallons of gas.

</line>


<line>
- You want a slug?

- No, I got to stay sharp.

</line>


<line>
I got another audition

this afternoon.

</line>


<line>
God, I can't wait till

I'm finally up

</line>


<line>
for real jobs instead

of these dumb commercials.

</line>


<line>
"Here's the thing about

most long-distance plans."

</line>


<line>
Ugh. I hate

when people say that.

</line>


<line>
- "Here's the thing."

- It's so stupid.

</line>


<line>
Just say the thing.

</line>


<line>
You don't need to introduce

the concept

that there's going

to be a thing.

</line>


<line>
I don't expect to

be offered <ital>Secretariat</ital>

right away,

but when am I gonna be up

for real roles?

</line>


<line>
We'll get there, BJ.

We both will.

</line>


<line>
In fact, if I play

my cards right,

</line>


<line>
I might get there real soon.

</line>


<line>
Wait.

</line>


<line>
- Did the guys from ABC call?

- Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
They invited me

to some hotshot event

at LACMA this weekend.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show

while they're drunk.

</line>


<line>
An off-the-clock,

non-work-related social event?

</line>


<line>
That's the perfect time

to pitch a TV show.

</line>


<line>
You're brilliant.

</line>


<line>
These people are so fancy.

</line>


<line>
Look, look, look.

Hey, hey, look.

</line>


<line>
That's Joyce DeWitt,

isn't it?

</line>


<line>
That's Joyce DeWitt.

And that's Angela Diaz.

</line>


<line>
And that's Ubu,

the guy who sits.

</line>


<line>
- He<ital> is </ital>a good dog.

- [Ubu barks]

</line>


<line>
Guys, don't take

your eyes off the prize.

</line>


<line>
We need to fill Charlotte's bag

with these mini quiches.

</line>


<line>
This is our breakfast

for June.

</line>


<line>
- Herb Kazzaz.

- Shit, we're busted.

</line>


<line>
- [plate shatters]

- Pretend you don't speak English.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Buongiorno. </ital>Bon Jovi.

</line>


<line>
Salutations.

Crap, that's English.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you mind if I steal

this superstar for a second?

</line>


<line>
Okay, yeah.

I'll catch you two later.

</line>


<line>
Stay out of trouble.

Oh, ho.

</line>


<line>
Well, there he goes.

</line>


<line>
Herb's about to hit

the big time,

and I'm just gonna be

a small-fry

doing tiny commercials

and eating mini quiches.

</line>


<line>
You're dead wrong.

</line>


<line>
You're gonna be

a big success.

</line>


<line>
Herb says that to me

all the time.

</line>


<line>
- He thinks the world of you.

- He does?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not worried about

if you'll become a star.

</line>


<line>
I'm more worried about how

you'll change when it happens.

</line>


<line>
Like, you think I'll get fat?

</line>


<line>
No, that's not

what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
So you're saying

I definitely

</line>


<line>
- won't get fat?

- No.

</line>


<line>
Well, make up your mind,

lady.

</line>


<line>
Look over there.

See those tar pits?

</line>


<line>
Hollywood's a real pretty town

that's smack on top

of all that black tar.

</line>


<line>
By the time you realize

you're sinking,

it's too late.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is this

a science lesson?

</line>


<line>
No, BoJack,

it's a metaphor.

</line>


<line>
- Ugh, that's worse.

- BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Really?

</line>


<line>
- Does Herb know?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
I don't think I'm the person

Herb's looking for.

</line>


<line>
I'm going to miss you,

Charlotte.

</line>


<line>
Hey, do you ever wonder

what would have happened

if you'd met me

before Herb did?

</line>


<line>
Would you have made

a move on me?

</line>


<line>
- Charlotte--

- I don't think you would have.

</line>


<line>
You know why?

</line>


<line>
I think you're a coward.

</line>


<line>
Now go stuff some prosciutto

in your pants

before that Webster kid

takes it all.

</line>


<line>
[upbeat music]

</line>


<line>
[Herb] I love this town.

</line>


<line>
Why did you bring me

to Griffith Park?

</line>


<line>
Are we gonna get in

a knife fight

like in

<ital>Rebel Without a Cause?</ital>

</line>


<line>
- I hate that title.

- He had several causes.

</line>


<line>
I wanted to give you this.

</line>


<line>
Look out at that city.

</line>


<line>
What do you see?

</line>


<line>
Wow, I didn't realize

there were

so many day hookers.

</line>


<line>
I see a city

that you and I

will run someday,

and when we're both famous

and have everything

we've ever wanted,

we'll come back here together

and high five.

</line>


<line>
I'm not fully on board

with this new high five thing.

</line>


<line>
What ever happened

to the low five?

</line>


<line>
Give me some skin.

</line>


<line>
BJ, listen.

I got a call from ABC today.

</line>


<line>
They bought my TV pitch.

</line>


<line>
What?

That's amazing.

</line>


<line>
- What's the show?

- It's called <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, good luck

on your rocket ship

to the top without me.

</line>


<line>
No, BoJack,

the show's about a horse,

and I told those suits

if they want my show,

then that horse is gonna

be BJ Goddamn Horseman.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, my God.

- And they said, "No."

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- And I said, "Please?"

</line>


<line>
And they said, "Okay."

</line>


<line>
So, what do you say?

</line>


<line>
- Want to be my star?

- Seriously?

</line>


<line>
Of course I do.

Of course, Herb.

</line>


<line>
Jesus Christ, thank you.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm--

Whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
I think you got

the wrong idea here.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, no, man. Whoa.

- Herb, I'm not--

</line>


<line>
Me either.

No, I just-- You know,

</line>


<line>
- I caught up in the moment.

- Yeah, no, I gotcha.

</line>


<line>
BJ, can you believe it?

</line>


<line>
We're gonna make

an actual TV show!

</line>


<line>
One that takes

an unflinching look

at the gritty reality

of the American family.

</line>


<line>
Just kidding.

Let's get rich!

</line>


<line>
[both] Yeah.

<line>
Why would I say,

"You'll never get me

in that sweater"

in this scene

and then,

in the very next scene,

</line>


<line>
I'm wearing the sweater?

</line>


<line>
Did my character suddenly forget

that he didn't want to wear

the sweater?

</line>


<line>
No, see,

that's actually the joke.

</line>


<line>
Don't explain the joke to me.

</line>


<line>
I just don't understand

how it's a joke.

</line>


<line>
So you do want me

to explain it to you?

</line>


<line>
I want you to add

a scene showing

how I changed my

mind about the sweater

so the goddamn episode

makes sense.

</line>


<line>
Look at me,

doing your job for you.

</line>


<line>
Way to go, Shakespeare.

</line>


<line>
BJ, you're doing

the scene as written.

</line>


<line>
What happened

to the stories I requested?

</line>


<line>
Where's my rap?

You said you'd write me a rap.

</line>


<line>
We're working on it.

</line>


<line>
We just need a rhyme for

"and I'm here to say."

</line>


<line>
Well, what about giving me

Rollerblades?

</line>


<line>
How are people gonna know

that my character is hip

if he doesn't roll the blade?

</line>


<line>
Just get out there

and do your job.

</line>


<line>
Every one of your ideas

is stupid or racist.

</line>


<line>
That was one pitch,

and I didn't say

they're all thieves.

</line>


<line>
But if you're too scared

to start

a national dialogue,

maybe I'll take my ideas home.

</line>


<line>
Good luck making <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

without the horse.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, hon.

</line>


<line>
That audience out there

traveled from all over

the country just

to taste some of your magic.

</line>


<line>
Do you really want

to disappoint them?

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

Okay, Sharona.

</line>


<line>
I'll go out and jerk

this limp script

until it gets hard,

but I'm not doing it

for Herb.

</line>


<line>
I'm doing it for the fans.

</line>


<line>
And your 30K an episode.

</line>


<line>
[announcer] Let's give it up

for BoJack Horseman!

</line>


<line>
And there better

be some Zimas

in my dressing room

after the show.

</line>


<line>
[cheers and applause]

</line>


<line>
Wait a minute.

This isn't the bar.

</line>


<line>
I got to fire my assistant.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
You guys sound like

you're ready for a show.

</line>


<line>
[rock music]

</line>


<line>
Oh, gross. Why do I keep

trying to like Zima?

<ital>- BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>How are you doing today?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll tell you

my problem.

</line>


<line>
- I just keep getting handsomer.

<ital>- [laughs]</ital>

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>

you'll goddamn kiss me.

</line>

</line>


<line>
What's the role

you've been dying

to play your whole life,

besides Kathy Ireland's

bathing suit?

</line>


<line>
Ha-ha.

She is attractive.

</line>


<line>
Good God, when I die,

bury me in Kathy Ireland.

</line>


<line>
Uh, Marv? Marv?

</line>


<line>
What's the big news?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Secretariat!</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's happening,

and it's down

to you and Val Kilmer

for the title role.

</line>


<line>
That's amazing.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Now, listen.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to see you

in any more tabloids.

</line>


<line>
Keep your head down

and your nose clean.

</line>


<line>
Now, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
I got a lunch

<line>
Sheeeiiiiit.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I gotta tell ya.

</line>


<line>
- I'm gay.

- No doy.

</line>


<line>
I know we haven't been close

for the past couple years.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm gonna hold back

my "No doys"

because there might be a lot.

</line>


<line>
But you know me, right?

</line>


<line>
You know that I'm a good guy.

</line>


<line>
They're gunning for me

at the network,

and if I get kicked off this,

I won't recover.

</line>


<line>
I need to know that

you've got my back.

</line>


<line>
If you threaten to walk,

they'll listen to you.

</line>


<line>
Herb, you picked

the worst possible time to--

</line>


<line>
Hey, you know I wouldn't

ask if I didn't need it.

</line>


<line>
Come on, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
How'd we get

so far apart, huh?

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
You know what?

You can count on me, Herb.

</line>


<line>
I mean, I wouldn't even be here

if it weren't for you.

</line>


<line>
I knew it!

I knew you'd come through.

</line>


<line>
And when this is all over,

we're going

to drive back up

to Griffith Park.

</line>


<line>
I still owe you

that high five, right?

</line>


<line>
Hey, this is

a dumb question,

but do you guys ever,

like, all link up together

and do, like, a party train

or a fun circle?

</line>


<line>
'Cause I feel like

I'd be doing that all the--

</line>


<line>
Never mind.

Stupid question.

</line>


<line>
Feel stupid for asking that.

</line>


<line>
- [crowd shouting]

- [barking]

</line>


<line>
Go right ahead.

</line>


<line>
And then it goes,

"I like healthy gums

in a major way."

</line>


<line>
See, that's

what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
That's great.

</line>


<line>
We just gotta make sure

that we work in the phrase

</line>


<line>
"toothbrush rap" early,

so they know I'm rapping.

</line>


<line>
BoJack,

can we chat for a second?

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Here we go.

It's the big one.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna waste

your time with small talk

because you work for me,

and your time is my time.

</line>


<line>
We're letting Herb go.

</line>


<line>
- You can't do that.

- "I can't do that."

</line>


<line>
I'm not asking you.

It's nothing personal.

</line>


<line>
I like Herb.

I think he's a good guy.

</line>


<line>
But this is a business,

and every day

we don't fire him,

we're flushing money

</line>


<line>
- down the crapper.

- Well, if he goes, I go.

</line>


<line>
"Well, if he goes, you go."

I wouldn't do that.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I think you're a star,

and sometimes being a star

means making tough choices.

</line>


<line>
You can storm out,

make a big show out of

what a "good" friend

you are,

or you could be

the guy who does his job.

</line>


<line>
- Angela--

- I'll tell you when

it's your turn

to talk again.

</line>


<line>
Look, you're a star,

but this is really just

the beginning of

the BoJack Horseman story.

</line>


<line>
You can choose

whatever path you want,

but I'll tell you right now.

</line>


<line>
You don't win awards

and you don't

get to be on the covers

of magazines

and you don't get

to play the lead role

in the <ital>Secretariat </ital>movie

by being a good friend.

</line>


<line>
What's that old expression

about how the show must go on?

</line>


<line>
Oh, right.

It's "Don't be an idiot."

</line>


<line>
So what do you think, BoJack?

That's a courtesy question.

</line>


<line>
I already know what you think

because I have conversations

like this one five times a day.

</line>


<line>
I know who you are,

and I know

you've already

made your decision.

</line>


<line>
But if you want

to surprise me,

now's the time to do it.

</line>


<line>
That's what I thought.

</line>


<line>
You're doing the right thing.

I know it's hard.

</line>


<line>
But if Herb's really your

friend, he'll understand.

</line>


<line>
Now, you've got

a show to put on,

so I'll let you get ready.

</line>


<line>
This was a good conversation.

Productive.

</line>


<line>
If you're lucky,

I'll never talk to you again.

</line>


<line>
[cup thuds]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[announcer] You folks ready for a show?

</line>


<line>
[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
'Cause I think

a certain someone

might show up any second.

</line>


<line>
[applause]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
- [cheers and applause]

- Wait a minute.

</line>


<line>
This isn't the bar.

</line>


<line>
I gotta fire my assistant.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
So what ended up happening

with <ital>Secretariat?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Went into turnaround.

</line>


<line>
I don't totally know

what "turnaround" means,

</line>


<line>
- but they never made the movie.

- Whoa.

</line>


<line>
This house is way bigger

than yours.

</line>


<line>
Herb's done really well

for a guy you dicked over.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, no. Ah.

- That's enough out of you.

</line>


<line>
Stay out here

and turn this car around

in case we need to leave

in a hurry.

</line>


<line>
Hooray. A task.

</line>


<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

</line>


<line>
BoJack!

Well.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, you look shitty.

</line>


<line>
Have you been eating your guilt

this whole time?

</line>


<line>
[all laugh]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you don't look

so hot yourself, Herb.

</line>


<line>
I have cancer.

</line>


<line>
And hello.

Who's this stunning creature?

</line>


<line>
And what string

of bad decisions

has placed you

in BoJack's orbit?

</line>


<line>
- Uh--

- This is Diane.

</line>


<line>
She's writing a book

about me.

</line>


<line>
Pleasure to meet you.

</line>


<line>
Is your book called,

<ital>Portrait of an Asshole?</ital>

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

I kid.

</line>


<line>
It's funny,

because he ruined my life.

</line>


<line>
I joke.

It's what I do.

</line>


<line>
Please, come in.

</line>


<line>
You're letting out

all the cancer.

</line>


<line>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

</line>


<line>
[forced laugh]

</line>


<line>
Ha ha...

</line>


<line>
Almost.

Ah...

</line>


<line>
Almost there.

</line>


<line>
Come on... ah.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

- [bear growls]

</line>


<line>
BoJack, how are

your utensils?

</line>


<line>
- Uh, they're fine.

- Are you sure?

</line>


<line>
Because if that knife

ain't sharp enough,

</line>


<line>
I got another that you left

in my back 20 years ago.

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- Could have seen that coming.

</line>


<line>
Who asks about utensils?

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go

to the bathroom.

</line>


<line>
Nope. No, you are not.

</line>


<line>
Uh.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Ow. Almost.

</line>


<line>
[exciting music]

</line>


<line>
- Drive, drive, drive!

- Oh. Oh, no.

</line>


<line>
I can't turn

the car around.

</line>


<line>
I've been trying to do this

three-point turn forever.

</line>


<line>
I mean, it's more

like a 300-point turn.

</line>


<line>
- Am I right, huh?

- Hee hee hee hee!

</line>


<line>
Hey, we've got two sacks

of Kardashian swag

and the fuzz on our heels.

</line>


<line>
You think this is Driver's Ed,

you hat-wearing pussy?

</line>


<line>
Drive the goddamn car!

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

</line>


<line>
Hey, Herb,

is that your Vitamix?

</line>


<line>
BoJack has one, too.

</line>


<line>
I wonder if you guys have

strong opinions about it

one way or the other.

</line>


<line>
Well, the stupid thing

was like 600 bucks.

</line>


<line>
I have used mine

a grand total of zero times.

</line>


<line>
I got it a month before

I was diagnosed with cancer.

</line>


<line>
I don't give a shit

about being healthy anymore.

</line>


<line>
I don't even have cancer,

and I don't use it.

</line>


<line>
- So who's it for?

- Exactly.

</line>


<line>
What is so great

about liquids?

</line>


<line>
Every article I read now is

"juice this" and "juice that."

</line>


<line>
You know why?

Juice controls the media.

</line>


<line>
- Hey-ooh.

- [both laugh]

</line>


<line>
Can't this thing

go any faster?

</line>


<line>
Uh, I'm going

as fast as I can.

</line>


<line>
[tires squealing]

</line>


<line>
Do you want me to get out?

Try to guide you?

</line>


<line>
No, I think

I'm almost there.

</line>


<line>
You're doing a great job.

</line>


<line>
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

</line>


<line>
Why? He's being nice.

</line>


<line>
Remember

the number one rule

of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

</line>


<line>
- "No falling in love."

- Ugh.

</line>


<line>
That's your rule

for every club.

</line>


<line>
It's a good rule.

</line>


<line>
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

</line>


<line>
I'm sensing a lot

of hostility here.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we should take

our masks off and actually talk.

</line>


<line>
You want me to take

my mask off? Fine.

</line>


<line>
Happy?

I took my mask off.

</line>


<line>
Did you?

</line>


<line>
Because I think

you're still wearing a mask.

</line>


<line>
[both] Oh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, Herb,

you met President Clinton?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah. Many times.

</line>


<line>
Did you think that

I spent the last 20 years

on my couch just feeling

sorry for myself?

</line>


<line>
I mean, I did do that,

but I also started...

</line>


<line>
[coughs] a charity

to bring clean water

to millions of children

in Sub-Saharan Africa.

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow.

</line>


<line>
I presented at

the Teen Choice Awards.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is that Charlotte?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah.

We kept in touch.

</line>


<line>
You should actually

give her a call.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure she'd

love to hear from you.

</line>


<line>
She looks good

for someone so old.

</line>


<line>
She's three years younger

than you.

</line>


<line>
- Exactly!

- [laughs]

</line>


<line>
- [coughs]

- Er?

</line>


<line>
Well, guys,

I'm pretty beat.

</line>


<line>
I think I need to

head off to bed,

and I hope

I actually wake up later.

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

</line>


<line>
And it was actually nice

to see you, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
You can see yourselves out.

</line>


<line>
[chuckling]

</line>


<line>
"Juice controls the media."

</line>


<line>
[chuckling]

I love it.

</line>


<line>
So I guess in a sense

</line>


<line>
I'm running away

from the cops,

but I feel like in another,

truer sense,

</line>


<line>
I'm running away from myself.

</line>


<line>
- Truth. Truth.

- Whoa.

</line>


<line>
Kenzie, do you have

anything to share?

</line>


<line>
Just how amazing it feels

to finally

be honest for once.

</line>


<line>
I could live a million lives,

and I'd never forget

this one afternoon.

</line>


<line>
Word.

</line>


<line>
You know, I act all cool

and sophisticated

on the outside,

but on the inside,

I'm just Todd, you know?

</line>


<line>
But thanks to you guys,

I think I'm finally

</line>


<line>
- ready to let my guard down.

- Do you hear that?

</line>


<line>
- He's letting his guard down.

- Let's get him!

</line>


<line>
- [grunts]

- Oh!

</line>


<line>
[both] Celebrity stealing club

strikes again.

</line>


<line>
[upbeat music]

</line>


<line>
This-- This just doesn't

feel right.

</line>


<line>
I should have brought

a bottle of wine.

</line>


<line>
That's what adults do.

BoJack, damn it.

</line>


<line>
Is that what's bothering you,

</line>


<line>
- that you didn't bring wine?

- You're right.

</line>


<line>
I just would have drunk it

on the way here.

</line>


<line>
This isn't about wine,

BoJack.

</line>


<line>
If you have something

you need to say to someone,

you should do it

while you have the chance

because before you know it,

it'll be too late.

</line>


<line>
Is this one of those things

where we're talking

about Herb but we're actually

talking about something else?

</line>


<line>
- No, I was talking about Herb.

- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

</line>


<line>
[cheerfully]

Hey, buddy!

</line>


<line>
You come back

for that Vitamix, you--

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

</line>


<line>
Ooh, you should get that

looked at.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I've been meaning

to see a doctor.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I wanted to talk

to you about... you know.

</line>


<line>
I feel bad about

what happened.

</line>


<line>
So you're apologizing.

</line>


<line>
Yes. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

I don't forgive you.

</line>


<line>
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

and I do not forgive you.

</line>


<line>
Uh... not sure you get

what's happening here.

</line>


<line>
This could be

the last time that you--

</line>


<line>
No. I'm not gonna

give you closure.

</line>


<line>
You don't get that.

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

You have to live

with the shitty thing

you did

for the rest of your life.

</line>


<line>
You have to know that

it's never,

ever going to be okay.

</line>


<line>
I really think that

we'd both

</line>


<line>
- feel better if we just--

- I'm dying.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna feel better,

and I'm not gonna be your prop

so you can feel better.

</line>


<line>
You have to believe me.

</line>


<line>
- I did everything I could.

- Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Then why didn't you call me?

Huh?

</line>


<line>
20 years--

You didn't call me.

</line>


<line>
Look, I-- I wanted to,

but I didn't think--

</line>


<line>
You know what

it was like for me?

</line>


<line>
I had nobody.

Everybody left.

</line>


<line>
I knew all those showbiz phonies

would turn on me.

</line>


<line>
Sure. But you?

</line>


<line>
It's not my fault

you got fired.

</line>


<line>
I don't care about the job!

</line>


<line>
I did fine.

I had a good life.

</line>


<line>
But what I needed then

was a friend,

and you abandoned me.

</line>


<line>
And I will never forgive you

for that.

</line>


<line>
Now, get the fuck

out of my house.

</line>


<line>
I--

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Hey, this is a dumb question,

but the gay thing

and the rectal cancer thing

aren't related, are they?

</line>


<line>
- Get out of here!

- Never mind.

</line>


<line>
Stupid question.

Forget I brought it up.

</line>


<line>
- Huh.

- Hey, BJ.

</line>


<line>
- Put that back, asshole!

- No, you gave this to me.

</line>


<line>
- [growls]

- No!

</line>


<line>
[both grunting]

</line>


<line>
[Diane] BoJack?

</line>


<line>
What are you doing?

Get off him.

</line>


<line>
The show was never the same

after I left. Admit it.

</line>


<line>
Some people prefer

the later years.

</line>


<line>
- [growling]

- BoJack. Come on.

</line>


<line>
- [panting]

- Thank you for inviting us.

</line>


<line>
You have a lovely home.

</line>


<line>
You know what

your problem is?

</line>


<line>
You want to think of yourself

as the good guy.

</line>


<line>
Well, I know you better

than anyone,

and I can tell you

that you're not.

</line>


<line>
In fact, you'd probably sleep

a lot better at night

if you just admitted

to yourself

that you're a selfish

goddamn coward

who takes whatever he wants

and doesn't give a shit

about who he hurts.

</line>


<line>
That's you.

That's BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why I came here.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. You do.

</line>


<line>
[engine revs, tires screech]

</line>


<line>
[Princess Carolyn]

<ital>You said you wanted a job.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter.

Nothing matters.

</line>


<line>
Wow.

What happened in Malibu?

</line>


<line>
- I gotta go.

- [phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
Hey, bright side.

</line>


<line>
At least now you have

a good story to tell

at his funeral.

</line>


<line>
Ugh, God.

</line>


<line>
I'm not trying

to kill the vibe here,

but I've had to pee

for, like, three hours.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Look, I won't put

what happened today

in the book

if you don't want me to.

</line>


<line>
No, it's okay.

</line>


<line>
Full truth like we agreed.

</line>


<line>
Warts and all.

</line>


<line>
It doesn't matter anyway.

</line>


<line>
I don't even care what anybody

thinks anymore.

</line>


<line>
Well, for

what it's worth,

</line>


<line>
I think it took

a lot of guts

to do what you did back there.

</line>


<line>
[water lapping]

</line>


<line>
- Mmm--

- Mm!
