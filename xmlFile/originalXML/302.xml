<line>
Whoa.

</line>


<line>
So, that was weird.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Wait.

Why did you think that was weird?

</line>


<line>
You know, you and me together, weird.

</line>


<line>
So it's not because

I did that talking penis thing, right?

</line>


<line>
Just the general concept of us

sleeping together that's weird, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Good morning, Hollywood.</ital>

<ital>It's a beautiful morning in sunny 2007.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, 2007?

Is that what time it is?

</line>


<line>
I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.

</line>


<line>
Well, you sure you don't want

to just hang around for a little bit?

</line>


<line>
- I got no plans.

- No, sadly, I have to go to my job,

to help my boss find gigs

for you to turn down.

</line>


<line>
If Marv brought me something good,

I would do it.

</line>


<line>
Besides, I'm still decompressing

from my last gig.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

That ended 11 years ago.

</line>


<line>
Really? Where does the time go?

[gulping]

</line>


<line>
What, you're just gonna stay at home

and get drunk all day?

</line>


<line>
Don't climb up my ass. I invited you

to play hooky and hang out with me.

</line>


<line>
I got a new HD DVD player.

</line>


<line>
Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, last night was fun

and you're sweet, sort of.

</line>


<line>
- I don't want to make a thing of this.

- We agree. It's not a thing.

</line>


<line>
- Not a thing.

- Definitely not a thing.

</line>


<line>
No, this is not a thing.

[nervous chuckling]

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

<line>
Hey, Todd, I think you just got a text.

</line>


<line>
"Who do you like,

question mark, colon, bracket"?

</line>


<line>
That's a smiley face, homeslice.

</line>


<line>
- Who do you like?

- I don't like anyone.

</line>


<line>
That's ridonkulous.

You have to like someone.

</line>


<line>
- If I have to, I guess, uh... Kimber?

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
Everyone likes Kimber.

That's like saying you like Fergie.

</line>


<line>
- Who do you like?

- I'm not allowed to like anyone.

</line>


<line>
My dad is real strict.

Do you know <ital>The Sopranos?</ital>

</line>


<line>
The show, or that weird saxophone

that Kenny G plays?

</line>


<line>
The show, about the guy in the mob?

That's what my dad does.

</line>


<line>
Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs,

</line>


<line>
we gotta bounce if we're gonna make

that flash mob at the Grove.

</line>


<line>
Man, I love flash mobs.

</line>


<line>
And I love you--

</line>


<line>
Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed".

It's a new video game.

</line>


<line>
- Okay, let's go flash mob.

- Whoo! Flash mobs.

</line>


<line>
<ital>♪ This ain't 2006</ital>

<ital>It's 2007 ♪</ital>

</line>


<line>
I just don't know

how I feel about my husband

</line>


<line>
doing a bunch of wacky commercials

overseas.

</line>


<line>
Not overseas, underseas.

</line>


<line>
You're looking at the new face

of Seaborn's Seahorse Milk.

</line>


<line>
What the hell is seahorse milk?

</line>


<line>
Beats me, but you better believe

I'm trusting Seaborn's.

</line>


<line>
For all my seahorse milk needs.

</line>


<line>
- It just seems a little cheesy.

- Hey, I'm not too big for anything.

</line>


<line>
And my flip phone

is blowing up with opportunities.

</line>


<line>
Michael Vick made me

a very strange offer.

</line>


<line>
But I'm gonna hear him out.

Always take the meeting.

</line>


<line>
Ahem. Can I help you?

</line>


<line>
I'll have an Americano

with steamed milk instead of water.

</line>


<line>
One latte?

</line>


<line>
For you, my second and final wife?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I usually like a cool drink

when it's hot outside

</line>


<line>
and a warm drink when it's cold outside.

</line>


<line>
But today is a perfect day, so--

</line>


<line>
One lukewarm coffee

for my gorgeous spouse.

</line>


<line>
Name?

</line>


<line>
Jessica, obviously. I'm Jessica Biel?

</line>


<line>
- Mmm... uh...

- From <ital>Stealth? Summer Catch?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Rules Of Attraction</ital>? Nothing?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> Girl from <ital>Seventh Heaven </ital>who

took her clothes off for that magazine?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, yeah.

- Thank you, Blarn?

</line>


<line>
That's my name.

</line>


<line>
So she kissed a girl, huh?

</line>


<line>
And she liked it? This I gotta see.

</line>


<line>
Talk to you later.

</line>


<line>
P.C., where are you hiding?

</line>


<line>
Right out here, Marv, same place

I've been for the last 14 years.

</line>


<line>
Get in here and tell me

what scripts I read this weekend.

</line>


<line>
We have three standouts here.

</line>


<line>
A feature called

<ital>No Country For Old Men.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- It's about a hunter who--

- [snoring]

</line>


<line>
Sorry, I fell asleep for a second.

Because that title's too long.

</line>


<line>
<ital>No Country For Old Men</ital>

<ital>It's About A Hunter Who?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Pass.

</line>


<line>
- Aaah!

- Titles should be two words.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Pretty Woman. Beautiful Girls.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Private Parts.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Then you might not like this next one,

<ital>There Will Be Blood?</ital>

</line>


<line>
There will <ital>not </ital>be blood.

</line>


<line>
I would have accepted

<ital>There Will, or Be Blood.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Firm pass.

- Oh!

</line>


<line>
This last one is really special.

</line>


<line>
It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom

writer named Cuddlywhiskers called...

</line>


<line>
- Hmm... <ital>Mitch's Life.</ital>

- Now <ital>there's </ital>a title.

</line>


<line>
I think if we attach the right talent,

this could be a hit.

</line>


<line>
You know who'd be great?

BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Don't make me laugh, because I have

a heart condition and it could kill me.

</line>


<line>
Every little thing I bring that guy,

he turns down.

</line>


<line>
I think with the right project,

BoJack could--

</line>


<line>
Bup, bup, bup! P.C., do I get <ital>you </ital>coffee

and pick up your dry cleaning

and buy you peek-a-boo negligees

for strange women

</line>


<line>
- you saw at the train station once?

- No.

</line>


<line>
Then how about I don't do your job

and you don't do my job?

</line>


<line>
You know,

I would like to be an agent someday.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, someday, sure.

</line>


<line>
But for now,

you're learning from one of the greats.

</line>


<line>
Mark my words.

</line>


<line>
The best agent in the world

couldn't get that joker off his ass.

</line>


<line>
Hmm...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.

</line>


<line>
I brought four Four Lokos.

That's 16 Lokos.

</line>


<line>
Finally someone brings me

an adequate amount of Lokos.

</line>


<line>
Are you trying to get me drunk?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

You <ital>were </ital>trying to get me drunk.

</line>


<line>
Where are you taking me,

what am I wearing?

</line>


<line>
To a meeting, and your clothes.

</line>


<line>
Is this a fedora?

What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz?

</line>


<line>
- I don't know.

- You know who.

</line>


<line>
I knew you wouldn't take this meeting

if I didn't trick you into it.

</line>


<line>
Cuddlywhiskers has a great script

and wants to meet you.

</line>


<line>
I have a script for you. It's called

"The BoJack Says No Chronicles".

</line>


<line>
Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want

to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.

</line>


<line>
Act two.

BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
BoJack: "No, thank you." End of episode.

</line>


<line>
Hey! Aren't you the horse

from <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> You see, this is why I don't

go out amongst the not-famouses.

</line>


<line>
Just do me a favor

and take this meeting.

</line>


<line>
- [groans]

- If you're a good boy,

we can do that weird French thing

you saw in that Internet video.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, parkour?

</line>


<line>
This show came to me

when I was in rehab.

</line>


<line>
I realized I'm only here on this earth

for a bit, why not dig deeper?

</line>


<line>
- Huh.

- Don't get me wrong.

</line>


<line>
I'm proud of the seven years

I spent on <ital>Krill &amp; Grace.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That show did so much

for the way society views krill people.

</line>


<line>
That show didn't make me happy.

</line>


<line>
The awards, the money

didn't make me happy.

</line>


<line>
Did you try spending the money on things?

</line>


<line>
I started to feel like I was trapped

in a giant plastic ball.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, meet my lovely assistant,

Jill Filipowicz.

</line>


<line>
- Hey.

- Hi.

</line>


<line>
- Did I say you could speak, wench?

- You can't talk to me like that.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- Clean up that mess this instant!

- No. I'm a dirty girl.

</line>


<line>
- Uh...

- I'm filthy.

</line>


<line>
- You are being very bad.

- You'll have to punish me later.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both chuckling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Jill and I have a very...

special relationship.

</line>


<line>
Want to tell me about the show?

I hear it's great.

</line>


<line>
I've worked on great shows

my whole career.

</line>


<line>
Great shows are easy.

</line>


<line>
I didn't become president of the <ital>Lampoon</ital>

so I could make "great" shows.

</line>


<line>
- <ital>Harvard Lampoon.</ital>

- Yeah, I got it.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to do something different here.

</line>


<line>
- Something that lasts.

- Huh.

</line>


<line>
Think about it.

</line>


<line>
If you're ready to finally stop being

"The Horse" from <ital>Horsin' Around,</ital>

send me an e-mail:

Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.

</line>


<line>
- That's H-A-R--

- I got it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You got some mail, babe.

</line>


<line>
Mwah! You understand I'm using

that pet name ironically, right?

</line>


<line>
Yes, Wayne.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, check it out,

a rejection letter from <ital>The New Yorker.</ital>

</line>


<line>
That magazine is for white people.

White people are the worst, right, guys?

</line>


<line>
Yup.

</line>


<line>
"Dear Diane.

We are sorry to say that your piece,

</line>


<line>
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',

wasn't right for us,

despite its evident merit."

Do you know what this means?

</line>


<line>
Caring leads to disappointment?

Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?

</line>


<line>
Someone gave my piece a read

and decided against it.

</line>


<line>
Their journalistic style

couldn't be more outmoded.

</line>


<line>
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."

- I never even thought they'd read it.

</line>


<line>
"Talk of the Town"?

More like "Schlock of the Clown".

</line>


<line>
Then they typed me a letter

that said it had "obvious merit".

</line>


<line>
"Shouts and Murmurs"?

More like "Louts and..."

</line>


<line>
What rhymes with murmurs?

</line>


<line>
For two people

who don't like <ital>The New Yorker,</ital>

you know a lot about the different

sections of <ital>The New Yorker.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:

</line>


<line>
"What if we stopped thinking of TV

as a conduit to tell stories

and thinking of it

as a conduit to tell truth?"

</line>


<line>
And I was like: "Damn, this guy

must have gone to Yale or something."

</line>


<line>
Sounds like you two really hit it off.

</line>


<line>
We were like Heidi and Spencer

up in there.

</line>


<line>
So you're gonna do the show?

</line>


<line>
- Nah. Timing's really off right now.

- [sighs]

iPhone's coming out this year,

I need to gear up for that.

</line>


<line>
I'm done. That's it, I'm tired

of bending over backwards for you.

</line>


<line>
I mean this in all seriousness,

professionally or in bed?

</line>


<line>
Why won't you do this?

Give me one good reason.

</line>


<line>
Because his show sounds incredible.

And what if... I'm not?

</line>


<line>
What if there's a reason the only thing

I'm known for is <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
BoJack, you are amazing.

</line>


<line>
You're bright and you're funny

and you're handsome and you're talented.

</line>


<line>
But if you can't see that,

then you're the biggest,

dumbest piece of shit in the world.

</line>


<line>
- [pop music playing]

- [laughter and chatter]

</line>


<line>
How long do we have to stay in here?

</line>


<line>
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.

- Uh...

</line>


<line>
We don't have to kiss.

</line>


<line>
I know you'd rather be in here

with Kimber.

</line>


<line>
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...

</line>


<line>
- What?

- I've never kissed anyone before.

</line>


<line>
That's okay.

Maybe we can try with each other?

</line>


<line>
That way, when you're in here with Kimber

one day, you'll know exactly what to do.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so how should we do it?

French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?

</line>


<line>
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do

because I practice all the time

with a picture of Adam Brody--

No, I don't!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Just close your eyes,

and we move our faces toward each other.

</line>


<line>
- Okay.

- Until we...

</line>


<line>
- [sighs]

- [Marv] Oh!

</line>


<line>
Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,

guess who just got BoJack a job.

</line>


<line>
You... are the secretary

of a wonderful agent.

</line>


<line>
Now go pick up

a pair of satin crotchless undies.

</line>


<line>
I saw a stewardess

at the Yum Yum Donuts.

</line>


<line>
We did not make eye contact.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Good morning, Los Angeles.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's two months later in 2007.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 2]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Two months later?</ital>

<ital>Two months later than what?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man 1]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Did I say two months later?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus,</ital>

<ital>I think I'm having a stroke.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Aaah!

</line>


<line>
- Jeez, sleep much?

- Jeez, watch me sleep much?

</line>


<line>
Well, I couldn't sleep.

</line>


<line>
I kept thinking about

today's first read-through.

</line>


<line>
These things

are always so nerve-wracking,

to sit there and perform

for all these people like some kind of a--

</line>


<line>
- Professional actor?

- Very funny.

</line>


<line>
- Before I forget, I got you a present.

- [gasps]

</line>


<line>
It's a box...

with crinkly tissue paper inside it.

</line>


<line>
How did you know?

</line>


<line>
Thank you

for putting this whole thing together.

</line>


<line>
Even though I still can't believe

I let you talk me into this.

</line>


<line>
Promise me

everything's going to be okay?

</line>


<line>
I promise it's gonna be great.

</line>


<line>
If you get scared,

look for me in the audience.

</line>


<line>
I'll be there the whole time,

laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

</line>


<line>
- Mmm...

- Mm-mmm-mm.

</line>


<line>
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle

into the garbage. Thud."

</line>


<line>
"Goodbye, old friend."

</line>


<line>
"Mitch turns off the light

and closes the door as we...

</line>


<line>
Fade to black. End of episode."

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Let's see what the suits say.

</line>


<line>
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,

make it appeal to middle America.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> That's the worst part of America.

</line>


<line>
Other than the bottom,

the top and most of the sides.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,

what can we say?

</line>


<line>
This is why you guys are the pros

and we're just the schmoes.

</line>


<line>
I think what my husband

is trying to say is, "Great job."

</line>


<line>
Enough with the torture.

</line>


<line>
Don't have to feed me to finger me.

Just lay on the notes.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> Our only note? No notes.

</line>


<line>
- No notes?

- We love this show.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.

</line>


<line>
This show is gonna be as big

as <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gulps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?

You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."

</line>


<line>
- It was so funny.

- Wow.

</line>


<line>
It seems like you're really

in sync with this Justin guy.

</line>


<line>
You should do all the things

with him that I can't do.

</line>


<line>
Like eat chocolate,

or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.

</line>


<line>
Why, tennis makes me so mad.

Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

</line>


<line>
Hello? Can we please get

some service in this place?

</line>


<line>
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.

I'm one of the Jessicas.

</line>


<line>
Mom, I'm finally gonna be

a published writer.

</line>


<line>
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"

is going to be published in McSweeney's.

</line>


<line>
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?

</line>


<line>
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no, no, no.

I'm not falling for that scam.

</line>


<line>
Website? We gotta print it out

on our own paper with our own ink?

</line>


<line>
<ital>- I don't think so.</ital>

- Mom.

</line>


<line>
And my Blockbuster original series

has been keeping me very busy.

</line>


<line>
I still don't get how that's gonna work,

at all.

</line>


<line>
Babe, it makes total sense.

</line>


<line>
They make the whole season,

put it on six DVD's.

</line>


<line>
People go to their local Blockbuster Video

and rent it out one disc at a time

for five days each.

</line>


<line>
What if someone already rented

the episodes they want?

</line>


<line>
They can just get something else,

like <ital>The Illusionist or The Prestige.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Whichever one you were in.

- Do you know which one?

</line>


<line>
- Do you?

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
- Why do you say yes to everything?

- I get excited by the possibilities.

</line>


<line>
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?

That is crazy.

</line>


<line>
- Buying it.

- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.

</line>


<line>
- Drop it. Drop it.

- [whimpers]

</line>


<line>
Good boy.

</line>


<line>
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!

</line>


<line>
- You heard what the network said.

- Heard they loved it.

</line>


<line>
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

</line>


<line>
Exactly. The network loved it.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

</line>


<line>
If you want my opinion, fellas,

you hit oil, stop drilling.

</line>


<line>
"I am an oil man.

I drink your milkshake."

</line>


<line>
- That'll be funny in a year or so.

- Before that got sad and weird,

you said, "If you want my opinion,"

and we don't.

</line>


<line>
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me

you wanted to do something different.

</line>


<line>
Now we're doing something that's gonna be

"just as good as <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>."

</line>


<line>
Is that what you wanted?

That's not why I'm here.

</line>


<line>
- I know.

- I really think you're making a mistake.

</line>


<line>
I'm not taking career advice

from somebody who's been

an assistant the last 14 years.

</line>


<line>
Is that how you think of me?

As your agent's assistant?

</line>


<line>
- What do you think you are?

- I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Here's some free advice:

you should know.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?

</line>


<line>
Somebody needs coffee,

I'll give you a ring.

</line>


<line>
Okay, best of luck.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Cuddlywhiskers,

let's give ourselves one night

to stick our dicks in this script

and go balls deep into the universe.

</line>


<line>
I'm in.

</line>


<line>
What's that, you say?

There's a panic? At the disco?

</line>


<line>
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?

</line>


<line>
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> Again with this

"I wanna be a female agent" thing.

</line>


<line>
They don't even have a word for it.

Uh, agentess, agentrix.

</line>


<line>
- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.

- Okay, okay!

</line>


<line>
You're an agent, all right?

I dub thee agent.

</line>


<line>
You can even take my office,

because I quit.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- Who needs the headache?

</line>


<line>
Thirty years I threw into this job

and it destroyed me from the inside out.

</line>


<line>
I never fell in love,

I never had a family.

</line>


<line>
I never even got to give that lacy teddy

to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> All I have is regrets.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!

I'm gonna make it after all.

</line>


<line>
Whaah!

</line>


<line>
First thing I'm gonna do

is get rid of that ceiling fan.

</line>


<line>
How do we make it clear

that this isn't <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
What if in the very first scene,

we show my character

literally taking a massive dump

on a VHS copy of <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
What? That's insane.

</line>


<line>
Let's just put it in,

we can always take it out later.

</line>


<line>
I want this character to be really edgy,

the kind of character Denis Leary

would be offered and then say:

</line>


<line>
"This character's too edgy for me."

</line>


<line>
What if he had a catchphrase

that was an anti-catchphrase?

</line>


<line>
Like if every time he entered the room

he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"

</line>


<line>
Not that, because that's horrible.

But something like that.

</line>


<line>
Whassup, bitches?

</line>


<line>
- That is so dumb.

- But kind of brilliant, right?

</line>


<line>
Yes, put that in.

Put all this in, this should be the show.

</line>


<line>
This should be the show.

</line>


<line>
I haven't felt this alive

since the head of the Charles Regatta.

</line>


<line>
- That's a Harvard thing.

- Yes. This is brilliant.

</line>


<line>
What if we had five minutes of him

reading a book to himself?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, yes.

</line>


<line>
Just him turning the page.

A close-up of my eyeball.

</line>


<line>
- [bottle breaks]

- The real shit, they never show that.

</line>


<line>
Wow, we did it.

</line>


<line>
We stayed up all night, but we really made

something new and different and daring.

</line>


<line>
We've changed everything but the title.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, how about

we give it a new title?

</line>


<line>
- <ital>The BoJack Horseman Show.</ital>

- [gasps]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,

I don't know what to say.

</line>


<line>
Well, then why don't you just say,

"Whassup, bitches?"

</line>


<line>
But, you know, not that.

</line>


<line>
- Something like that.

- We'll figure it out.

</line>


<line>
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?

Let's not forget why we're here tonight.

</line>


<line>
To raise money

for the John Edwards campaign.

</line>


<line>
I was talking

to one of the volunteers earlier

and she was just gushing

about how John Edwards touched her.

</line>


<line>
I say, let's make this man president

so he can touch whoever he wants.

</line>


<line>
- Four hundred dollars.

- I don't know what's cheesier,

this three-cheese risotto

or that dude's patter.

</line>


<line>
Seriously.

</line>


<line>
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser

for a better host of this fundraiser.

</line>


<line>
Totes McGotes.

</line>


<line>
I'll post that to my Twitter page.

You should follow me.

</line>


<line>
I'm A with a circle around it,

"insWayne in the membWayne".

</line>


<line>
- [Diane sighs]

- What's a Twitter page?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckling]</nonVerbComm> Erica, you know you're not

allowed to vote in national elections.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[electronic music playing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
You sure it's okay

to be in your parents' bedroom?

</line>


<line>
Todd, so we've been together

for months now.

</line>


<line>
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
We don't have to.

I don't wanna peer pressure you.

</line>


<line>
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.

</line>


<line>
- Um...

- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.

</line>


<line>
Okay, here we-- Here I go.

Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

</line>


<line>
- [garage door opening]

- Did you hear that?

</line>


<line>
Oh, snap. My dad's home early.

You gotta get out of here.

</line>


<line>
Your dad, the mobster?

</line>


<line>
What? My dad's not a mobster.

</line>


<line>
You said he was like that guy

from <ital>The Sopranos.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I said he works on <ital>The Sopranos</ital>.

He's an editor.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.

</line>


<line>
He must be so desensitized to violence

and nihilistic ruminations

on the banality of evil.

</line>


<line>
Here, out the window.

You love shimmying, right?

</line>


<line>
You know I love shimmying,

but that's a two-story drop.

</line>


<line>
Use this.

</line>


<line>
- Go, get out. Go, go!

- Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts]</nonVerbComm>

Sorry.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Mamma mia!</ital>

</line>


<line>
- So, the island's purgatory, right?

- What's really happening--

</line>


<line>
- Hold that thought.

- [groans]

</line>


<line>
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

</line>


<line>
I figured since I'm your agent, I should

at least show up to your premiere party.

</line>


<line>
I know I haven't called in a while.

I've been really busy.

</line>


<line>
I figured you'd call me

if you needed a coffee.

</line>


<line>
Ouch.

</line>


<line>
Hey, big premiere tonight.

Very exciting.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you

the horse from <ital>Horsin' Around?"</ital>

</line>


<line>
From now on it'll be,

"You're BoJack Horseman."

</line>


<line>
I'm happy for you, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
- How about a kiss for good luck?

- No, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I'm your agent and your friend,

and I will always support you.

</line>


<line>
But I'm 33 years old, and I want

to have a family by the time I'm 40.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to spend the next seven years

in and out of love with you.

</line>


<line>
I've wasted too much time

waiting for things to happen.

</line>


<line>
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.

</line>


<line>
And for what it's worth, I always liked

the horse from <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
- You did?

- Yeah. Everybody did.

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable.

Un-Jessica-Bielievable.

</line>


<line>
Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?

</line>


<line>
There are a lot of big producers,

this could be my next big break.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

This podunk benefit is below us.

</line>


<line>
I'm about to be in what I've been told

is a very important gay rights movie,

</line>


<line>
<ital>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I now pronounce me very impressed,

but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.

</line>


<line>
- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."

- Hey, if you like Justin so much,

maybe you should just continue

to be really good friends with him.

</line>


<line>
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.

</line>


<line>
Uh, I didn't say that.

</line>


<line>
I now pronounce this marriage over.

Biel with it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sobbing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- You wanted water?

- Thanks.

</line>


<line>
Wait. Blarn, right?

Yeah, from the coffee shop.

</line>


<line>
What are you doing here?

Is there coffee to "bariste"?

</line>


<line>
I also do cater waiter gigs

to make ends meet.

</line>


<line>
You "bariste" and cater <ital>and</ital> waiter?

[laughs] Triple threat.

</line>


<line>
I should be bringing you the water.

</line>


<line>
You know, just for the record, I think

it's cool that you put yourself out there.

</line>


<line>
A lot of guys in your position

wouldn't take gigs like this.

</line>


<line>
They'd be afraid people

would make fun of them.

</line>


<line>
That's dumb.

</line>


<line>
If you care about what other people think,

you're never gonna do anything.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, you're right.

- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.

</line>


<line>
I was like, "Why did I say that?

That was so dumb."

</line>


<line>
Then you were like, "That's right."

And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."

</line>


<line>
- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?

- Go ahead.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm> This monkey suit is killing me.

</line>


<line>
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

</line>


<line>
Sweet hang, Blarn.

You're one in a million.

</line>


<line>
- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.

- What?

</line>


<line>
I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke

to subvert the idea

of co-opting personal identity

to further corporate branding which,

as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
"Blarn." That is very funny.

You should be a writer.

</line>


<line>
Thanks. I'm Diane.

</line>


<line>
- Mr. Peanutbutter.

- Yeah, I know.

</line>


<line>
- Add me on MySpace, okay?

- Sure.

</line>


<line>
All right.

Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

</line>


<line>
It's Diane.

</line>


<line>
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.

</line>


<line>
Call it off.

Call the whole thing off.

</line>


<line>
What do you mean?

We premiere in two minutes.

</line>


<line>
Call the network,

cancel the whole thing.

</line>


<line>
Nobody wants to see me take a dump

on a <ital>Horsin' Around</ital> VHS.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, it's going to be fine.

This is what we wanted, remember?

</line>


<line>
Easy for you to say.

It's my name on the show.

</line>


<line>
This is why I didn't want to do

another TV show. Everything was perfect.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, this shit is bananas.

B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

</line>


<line>
I can't promise everyone

will love this show.

</line>


<line>
No matter what, people will remember it.

</line>


<line>
Five, ten years from now, this is the show

people will associate you with,

and you'll be glad they do.

</line>


<line>
Because this show is real,

it's edgy, it's different.

</line>


<line>
A lesser talent

couldn't have pulled it off.

</line>


<line>
But I'm willing to bet

on BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
- Are you?

- Yes, I am.

</line>


<line>
Great. Because the show is starting

and your life is about to change forever,

in three, two, one.

</line>
