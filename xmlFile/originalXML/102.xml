  <title>BoJack Hates the Troops - BoJack Horseman</title>









  <line> Say when. </line>


  <line> When. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, you'll never guess who's here. </line>


  <line> Think '90s. </line>


  <line> No, BoJack Horseman from <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>
  </line>


  <line> No, I mean, he got a little fatter, but it's definitely him. </line>


  <line> He looks really sad. It's hilarious. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Get over here now. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[upbeat ringtone] [cell phone vibrates]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> I told you, I don't know where it is. </line>


  <line> Don't put things in my butt if you want them back. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[phone rings]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> And hold for Princess Carolyn, please. </line>


  <line> Thanks, Laura. </line>

  <line> BoJack, it's your favorite agent. </line>


  <line> Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me in the room for <ital>War Horse.</ital>
  </line>


  <line> There were, like, ten horses in that movie. </line>


  <line> I didn't need to be the warhorse. </line>


  <line> Listen, dummy, I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow. </line>


  <line> Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions? </line>


  <line> The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? </line>


  <line> Yeah, probably. </line>


  <line> Okay, all right, there's no need to get-- </line>


  <line> What, catty? Are you gonna say catty? </line>


  <line> - I was not gonna say catty. - Oh, what were you gonna say? </line>


  <line> I was gonna say catty because you're a cat. </line>


  <line> Goodbye, BoJack. </line>


  <line> Laura, I know you're listening. You got it, right? </line>


  <line> Laura, do not respond to him. Goodbye, BoJack. </line>


  <line> She got it. [camera shutter clicks] </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Oh, my God. Take another one. </line>


  <line> Take another one. </line>


  <line> Excuse me, I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight, and I
    hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it. </line>


  <line> Excuse me? </line>


  <line> I was actually already in a bad mood, but I thought maybe for one night, </line>


  <line> I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself, but now because of you and your
    friends, </line>


  <line> I feel more self-conscious than ever. </line>


  <line> If we were bothering you so much, why didn't you just leave? </line>


  <line> Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid. </line>


  <line> Look, I have a right to be here. </line>


  <line> No! </line>


  <line> Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away
    with things, but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you,
    and you are a horrible person, and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't
    make you less of a horrible person. </line>


  <line> You think I'm pretty? </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[chuffs]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices. </line>


  <line> What'd you say? </line>


  <line> I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed. </line>

  </line>


  <line> - Good morning. - Ah! </line>


  <line> Why are you here? </line>


  <line> I slept here. </line>


  <line> Yeah, but why are you still here? </line>


  <line> Breakfast. </line>


  <line> That better not be my last Toaster Strudel. </line>


  <line> No, there were three left. </line>


  <line> Well, get out of here. </line>


  <line> My memoirist is gonna show up soon, and I don't need you-- </line>


  <line> - What's your name? - Pam. </line>


  <line> I don't need you Pam-ing up the place when she gets here. </line>


  <line> - Hey, BoJack. - Ah! Why are you here? </line>


  <line> - You told me to come at 9:00. - That doesn't sound like me. </line>


  <line> I have your email right here. [clears throat] </line>


  <line> "Diane, why don't you come over Tuesday morning at 9:00? </line>


  <line> Also, you should bring this email with you because I might not remember it because I just
    took a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha. </line>


  <line> Also, please don't put in my book that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha. </line>


  <line> I just use a small dose to help me fall asleep at night and then a much, much larger dose
    to get me through the day. </line>


  <line> Also, I'm drunk. </line>


  <line> Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone. </line>


  <line> Please don't put that in my book, book, book, book 'em, dildo. </line>


  <line> Does it taste like magenta in here?" </line>


  <line> Then I think you fell asleep on the keyboard because it just says the letter "B" 27 times. </line>


  <line> That does sound like me. </line>


  <line> Well, anyway, this is my businessperson... </line>


  <line> Excuse me? </line>


  <line> Here to help me with some business needs. </line>


  <line> - All very above board. - Uh, what'd you say? </line>


  <line> No need to mention her in the book either, unless it's a business book. </line>


  <line> - [laughs] - Ha ha, classic BoJack. </line>


  <line> Why are you here? </line>


  <line> Oh, funny story, I'm filming a reality show later, </line>


  <line> so I thought I'd drop by with the old tennis ball and chain. </line>


  <line> That is neither funny nor a story nor a reason for you to drop by. </line>


  <line> Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag </line>


  <line> about his reality show. </line>


  <line> Get this, I am starring in a pilot presentation </line>


  <line> for a celebrity reality show. </line>


  <line> It's pretty cutting edge, huh? </line>


  <line> Yeah, if it's 2003. </line>


  <line> Ha ha. Don't tell VH1 that. </line>


  <line> Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that. </line>


  <line> We are calling it <ital>Peanutbutter and Jelly.</ital>
  </line>


  <line> Get it? </line>


  <line> - Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter. - Okay, who's jelly? </line>


  <line> No, no, no. It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. </line>


  <line> It's wordplay. </line>


  <line> You may have too forgiving a definition of the word "wordplay." </line>


  <line> Well, it's a working title. </line>


  <line> Well, it could be working harder, and that's wordplay. </line>


  <line> How'd you even get in here? </line>


  <line> Your roommate let us in. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Mi casa es su casa.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels, and now my morning is ruined. </line>


  <line> Could you guys keep it down, okay? </line>


  <line> I'm kind of on a date right now. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[speaking Japanese]</nonVerbComm> In America, </line>


  <line> I am actually considered very handsome. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>[giggling]</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast, and when I get back, I want everyone out of my house
    except for you and you and-- </line>


  <line> - Who are you again? - The girl you had sex with. </line>


  <line> Right. You definitely should have already been gone. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[tires screech]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> I really shouldn't eat chocolate </line>


  <line> 'cause it can literally kill me. </line>


  <line> Oh, I know. </line>


  <line> - But I love chocolate. - Story of my life. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Hey, excuse me. </line>


  <line> Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>
  </line>


  <line> Yeah, okay, I don't care. </line>


  <line> Those are my muffins. </line>


  <line> I'm sorry, I-- I don't understand. </line>


  <line> Did you bring them into the store with you? </line>


  <line> No, but I was going to buy them. </line>


  <line> That's the last box, and I had dibs on them. </line>


  <line> Really? You had dibs? </line>


  <line> Yeah, dibs. </line>


  <line> I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom. </line>


  <line> Look, I don't even want the muffins. </line>


  <line> I was just looking at them, but I got to say, if you put muffins down, they're not your
    muffins. </line>


  <line> So what, I was supposed to take them into the bathroom with me? </line>


  <line> You didn't even put the muffins in a cart. </line>


  <line> You just left them out here. </line>


  <line> Yeah, in the produce section. </line>


  <line> Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section. </line>


  <line> That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs? </line>


  <line> Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here. </line>


  <line> Then give me the muffins. </line>


  <line> No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins. </line>


  <line> You think that because you're a pseudo-celebrity, normal rules don't apply to you? </line>


  <line> Pseudo? Would you say that to Eric McCormack? </line>


  <line> Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need-- </line>


  <line> You've had a rough morning? </line>


  <line> I spent the last ten months-- </line>


  <line> Hey! </line>


  <line> Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya. </line>


  <line> You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm> Oh, really? </line>


  <line> I'm gonna regret buying muffins? </line>


  <line> What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them? </line>


  <line> Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat. </line>


  <line> Why'd I buy these? </line>


  <line> Man, I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home. </line>


  <line> Well, my date with Ayako went really well. </line>


  <line> Thanks for asking. </line>


  <line> I specifically didn't ask, and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your
    personal life. </line>


  <line> She's hilarious. </line>


  <line> I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers. </line>


  <line> Still not interested. </line>


  <line> Should we get started on the book? </line>


  <line> What's your hurry? </line>


  <line> What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our 12-hour anniversary? </line>


  <line> She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name. </line>


  <line> Okay, let's get to work. </line>


  <line> Let's start at the beginning. </line>


  <line> What was your childhood like? </line>


  <line> - Normal. - Normal? </line>


  <line> Yeah, it was, uh, normal-- normal childhood stuff. </line>


  <line> Here's your omelet. </line>


  <line> I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes, but then you're not married
    to your secretary, are you? </line>


  <line> Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion, </line>


  <line> I would be. </line>


  <line> Mommy, can I have an omelet? </line>


  <line> You're the birthday boy. </line>


  <line> Normal childhood, and then just get right into the big, famous part. </line>


  <line> Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait. </line>


  <line> I am ready to talk. </line>


  <line> Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? </line>


  <line> They're so normal. That's crazy. </line>


  <line> You sound like a crazy person, not me. </line>


  <line> Stop being so crazy, crazy. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughing]</nonVerbComm> Why are you calling me crazy? </line>


  <line> Okay. Was your father-- [upbeat ringtone] </line>


  <line> Hold on, I got to take this. Hello? </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Hey, BoJack, I've got</ital>

    <ital>Princess Carolyn for you.</ital>

  <line> Great question. </line>


  <line> Well, I didn't fall down on my remote, randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while
    simultaneously crippling myself, thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea, so no. </line>

    <ital>a naval officer on leave</ital>

    <ital>from Afghanistan.</ital>

  <line>
    <ital>Welcome to the program, Neal.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Thank you, Tom.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Hey, I met this guy. </line>

    <ital>All Neal wanted</ital>

    <ital>when he got home--</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>and I emphasize,</ital>

    <ital>from Afghanistan--</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>was his favorite brand</ital>

    <ital>of breakfast muffins.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>When he went to the supermarket</ital>

    <ital>and called dibs</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>on the last box--</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Well, tell us</ital>

    <ital>what happened, Neal.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>BoJack Horseman, from</ital>

    <ital>the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>refused to respect my dibs.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Have you no shame,</ital>

    <ital>BoJack Horseman?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Seen here sneezing</ital>

    <ital>at a Christmas party.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Oh, not the sneezing pic--</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Why do they always use</ital>

    <ital>the sneezing picture?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>In the '90s,</ital>

    <ital>we laughed at your antics.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Oh, how we laughed.</ital>

    <ital>"Ha ha ha,"</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>we chortled</ital>

    <ital>in rapturous glee.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>But when you deny the dibs</ital>

    <ital>called by our men and women</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>on the frontlines, that is</ital>

    <ital>a sick joke, sir.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>A sick, sick joke, indeed,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>and you'll forgive me</ital>

    <ital>if I chortle no longer,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>for, to me, there is</ital>

    <ital>nothing the least bit funny</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>about stealing a meal</ital>

    <ital>from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>[grunting]</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy SEAL? </line>


  <line> I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL. </line>


  <line> I just thought he was the regular kind of seal. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>This is</ital>

    <ital>classic Hollywood elitism.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>BoJack Horseman thinks that</ital>

    <ital>because he was on TV,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>that makes him better</ital>

    <ital>than everybody.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Well, guess what, BoJack,</ital>

    <ital>now I'm on TV,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>so now I'm better</ital>

    <ital>than everybody!</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>That's right, Neal.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow. </line>


  <line> You guys think I should call in and set the record straight? </line>


  <line> BoJack, these people feed off controversy. </line>


  <line> If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan-- </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I'm now receiving word</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>that we've got BoJack himself</ital>

    <ital>on the phone.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Sorry, stopped listening. </line>


  <line> You were ramping up to a "yes," right? </line>


  <line>
    <ital>BoJack, what you did today</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>was a slap in the face</ital>

    <ital>of America's heroes.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Will you apologize?</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Okay, enough about America's heroes. </line>


  <line> Can we talk about dibs? </line>


  <line> Because he didn't even really have dibs. </line>


  <line> If he had legitimate dibs-- </line>


  <line> Oh, I had dibs on the muffins. </line>


  <line> I hid them in the produce section! </line>


  <line> You left them totally out in the open. </line>


  <line> That's hiding? </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[yelling]</nonVerbComm> How did you survive in Afghanistan? </line>


  <line> Those are my muffins! </line>


  <line> You give me back my muffins! [barks] </line>


  <line> Hey, guess what, I can't give them back </line>


  <line> 'cause I ate them all, okay? </line>


  <line> Dude. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Hold on, just to be clear,</ital>

    <ital>since this morning,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>you ate all the muffins?</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no self-control and I hate myself. </line>


  <line> Is that what you want to hear? </line>


  <line> Neal, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins? </line>


  <line> No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that. </line>


  <line> Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box? </line>


  <line> Yeah, there were exactly 12! </line>


  <line> I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one! </line>


  <line> There's your goddamn news story, the mystery of my missing goddamn self-respect! </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[pants]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> How'd I come off? </line>


  <line> Well, that went slightly better than the worst it could have possibly gone, so hooray? </line>


  <line> It's not even about the muffins. </line>


  <line> Everyone is just out to get me because I'm famous and so well-adjusted. </line>


  <line> Well, at least you've got some privacy. </line>


  <line> My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house. </line>


  <line> If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof because it's the only place they don't have
    insurance to film. </line>


  <line> You go on the roof? </line>


  <line> Yeah, just to get some work done. </line>


  <line> Is that really weird? </line>


  <line> No, it's adorable. </line>


  <line> When I was a kid, I used to climb onto the roof with my dad and look at the stars. </line>


  <line> What about you? </line>


  <line> Were you close with your father? </line>


  <line> Happy Father's Day, Daddy. </line>


  <line> What is this supposed to be, a lima bean? </line>


  <line> It's a heart. </line>


  <line> That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son. </line>


  <line> - I tried my best. - No, you didn't. </line>


  <line> You slacked off and took the easy way out. </line>


  <line> In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way. </line>


  <line> You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut
    through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat? </line>


  <line> Um, the canal? </line>


  <line> You go around the horn the way God intended! </line>


  <line> Uneventful. </line>


  <line> - What? - What? </line>


  <line> I asked if you were close with your father, and you sat here in silence for five minutes
    and then said, "Uneventful." </line>


  <line> You know what, this is a really good conversation, and I definitely want to keep having it,
    but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing, so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough
    deconstruction of my past, so I can put that other thing to bed before it spirals out of con-- </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I had dibs!</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>- My dibs were on those muffins!</ital>

    <ital>- Your dibs were void!</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I spent a year in Afghanistan</ital>

    <ital>making America safer,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>and this is the thanks I get?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Really, you, specifically,</ital>

    <ital>made America safer?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Well, BoJack, surely,</ital>

    <ital>even you would agree</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>that the troops are heroes.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I don't agree to that.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Maybe some of the troops are</ital>

    <ital>heroes but not automatically.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I'm sure a lot</ital>

    <ital>of the troops are jerks.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Most people are</ital>

    <ital>jerks already,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>and it's not like giving</ital>

    <ital>a jerk a gun and telling him</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>it's okay to kill people</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>suddenly turns that jerk</ital>

    <ital>into a hero.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> What? </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Did you just say you think</ital>

    <ital>the troops are jerks?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Oh, you took that the bad way,</ital>

    <ital>didn't you?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>I'm sure a lot</ital>

    <ital>of the troops are jerks.</ital>

  </line>


  <line> No, no, no. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>- The troops are jerks?</ital> - Oh, God. </line>


  <line>

  <line> This whole you hating the troops thing is not great. </line>


  <line> I don't hate the troops. </line>


  <line> I just hate one specific troop. I don't even hate him, really. </line>


  <line> I just think that he's wrong about the muffins. </line>


  <line> I know, BoJack-- just like always, you're right, and everyone else is wrong. </line>


  <line> But if you don't swallow your pride, this is never gonna let up. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>- I know you're stubborn--</ital> - I'm not stubborn. </line>


  <line> - I'm proud. - That's kind of the same thing. </line>


  <line> No, it's an important distinction. </line>


  <line> Okay, fine. You're not stubborn. </line>


  <line> But I'm about to tell you something very important, </line>

    <ital>That's the name</ital>

    <ital>Was it Randy?</ital>

    <ital>Did Randy come up with that?</ital>

    <ital>Anyway, the former</ital>

    <ital>television actor</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>who hates our troops</ital>

    <ital>has not left his home</ital>

  </line>

    <ital>since his controversial remarks</ital>

    <ital>on Monday</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>about how he hates the troops.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>BoJack Horseman</ital>

    <ital>makes me sick.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>He voiced his opinion,</ital>

    <ital>even though it was unpopular,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>and that's the most cowardly</ital>

    <ital>thing a person can do.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>After we made love, he covered</ital>

    <ital>himself in sheets like an Arab.</ital>

    <ital>At this very moment,</ital>

    <ital>Congress is voting</ital>

    <ital>Joan, I'm sorry</ital>

    <ital>to interrupt you,</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>but we've got some big news</ital>

    <ital>on the BoJack Horseman front.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>It appears that BoJack's Lexus</ital>

    <ital>is coming out of the garage.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>This is very big news, indeed.</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Any comment on BoJack's</ital>

    <ital>controversial remarks this week?</ital>

  </line>


  <line>
    <ital>Uh, nope.</ital> [tires screech] </line>


  <line> So where are we going? </line>


  <line> Don't worry, I've got a plan. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[tires screech]</nonVerbComm> Whoa! </line>


  <line> Jeez. </line>


  <line> Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto. </line>


  <line>
    <ital>[speaking Japanese]</ital>

    <ital>You son of a bitch!</ital>

  </line>


  <line> You told me you were an obscenely rich American entrepreneur. </line>


  <line> You had eighty dollars in your bank account. </line>


  <line> Eighty! </line>


  <line> Hey, I meant I was rich because I have friends like George Bailey. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[speaking Japanese]</nonVerbComm> Who the shit is George Bailey? </line>


  <line> Do you have any idea how much work went into scamming you? </line>


  <line>
    <ital>George Bailey!</ital>

  </line>


  <line> Hello? </line>


  <line> Well, I'm out of ideas. </line>


  <line> We can hide out at my place while we make a plan. </line>


  <line> Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras. </line>


  <line> Do we really need to be filming this? </line>


  <line> It's for my reality show. </line>


  <line> You never know when gold's gonna strike. </line>


  <line> Yeah, gold doesn't strike. </line>


  <line> That's why you never know. </line>


  <line> BoJack, be nice. </line>


  <line> Just pretend they're not there. </line>


  <line> Okay. Well, I-- </line>


  <line> Could you speak up, please? </line>


  <line> - I'd like to-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. </line>


  <line> That's too loud. </line>


  <line> I want to fix this as quickly as possible. </line>


  <line> I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore, even though I was definitely right. </line>


  <line> I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing my tell-all memoir, so everyone will
    pay attention to me again. </line>


  <line> I've already reached out to the McBeal camp. </line>


  <line> He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of
    muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do. </line>


  <line> But I ate the muffins. </line>


  <line> I know. We got another box. </line>


  <line> It's in the cupboard. </line>


  <line> Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too. </line>


  <line> We've been here for ten minutes! </line>


  <line> It's okay, we'll get more muffins. </line>


  <line> I'll get the muffins, and they're on me. </line>


  <line> I just found out I got 80 bucks in the bank. </line>


  <line> I'm helping! Hooray! </line>


  <line> So where are we gonna do this? </line>


  <line> Do I have to go on MSNBSea? </line>


  <line> No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it. </line>


  <line> Oh, why don't you do it on <ital>Peanutbutter and Jelly</ital>? </line>


  <line> You can't call a show <ital>Peanutbutter and Jelly</ital> if there's no jelly. </line>


  <line> It's a pun. </line>


  <line> It's not a pun if it only works one way. </line>


  <line> Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now? </line>


  <line> Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality
    show, which we all agree is really clever. </line>


  <line> We can edit this to make me look smart, right? </line>

  <line> How's this look? Looks good? </line>


  <line> - Okay. - Marker, sound, speed. </line>


  <line> Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's
    company, as we often do. </line>


  <line> Yes, this is all very authentic and natural. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Oh, someone's at the door! </line>


  <line> I will see who it is. </line>


  <line> Wow, this is a surprise. </line>


  <line> Neal McBeal. </line>


  <line> Hello, sir. </line>


  <line> Thank you for inviting me into your home. It is lovely. </line>


  <line> BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal? </line>


  <line> Ahem. </line>


  <line> Oh, yeah, Todd? </line>


  <line> What the hell is this? </line>


  <line> I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason. </line>


  <line> But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns. </line>


  <line> I'm sorry? </line>


  <line> Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-N-Out. </line>


  <line> Why does anybody pay for anything? </line>


  <line> Ow. </line>


  <line> Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns. </line>


  <line> - What? - Yes, hamburger buns. </line>


  <line> It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often. </line>


  <line> I'm listening. </line>


  <line> We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't
    mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as
    good? </line>


  <line> Mmm. </line>


  <line> American made. </line>


  <line> So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero. </line>


  <line> Well, I don't know if I-- </line>


  <line> Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero. </line>


  <line> You're a hero. </line>


  <line> The troops are all heroes, every single one. </line>


  <line> Great. </line>


  <line> And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to
    honor by turning real people into political pawns. </line>


  <line> Okay, you can let go of the bag now. </line>


  <line> Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by
    a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while
    refusing to hold our own government to the same standard. </line>


  <line> Yeah, me neither. I think we're in agreement here. </line>


  <line> Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking
    place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into
    easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases. </line>


  <line> Okay. </line>


  <line> And finally, I don't-- </line>


  <line> Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head. </line>


  <line> Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am? </line>


  <line> Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? </line>


  <line> Who gave him a bucket? </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make. </line>


  <line> Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? </line>


  <line> Come on. </line>


  <line> Bucket! Bucket! </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[crowd]</nonVerbComm> Bucket! </line>


  <line> Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! </line>


  <line> Hey, can anyone find a handle? </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[howls] [all cheer]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Oh, thank you, my friend. </line>


  <line> You're a real hero. </line>


  <line> Unbelievable. </line>


  <line> What's your name, young lady? </line>


  <line> Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me Jelly. </line>


  <line> What? Oh, my God, did we get that? </line>


  <line> Please tell me we got that. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[chuffs]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> You want a day-old hamburger bun? </line>


  <line> I'm all right. How'd it go down there? </line>


  <line> You know what the problem is with everybody? </line>


  <line> They all just want to hear what they already believe. </line>


  <line> No one ever wants to hear the truth. </line>


  <line> I want to hear the truth. </line>


  <line> I don't know if you want to tell it, though. </line>


  <line> What do you mean? </line>


  <line> Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father? </line>


  <line> Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some, if that's what you're
    looking for, but I thought you might want more than that. </line>


  <line> I do. </line>


  <line> Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real. </line>


  <line> What, you think I can't open up? </line>


  <line> Well, I don't know if you can or not. </line>


  <line> You certainly haven't. </line>


  <line> <nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> </line>


  <line> Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all. </line>


  <line> You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you? </line>


  <line> I don't know, are you an asshole? </line>


  <line> Okay, full truth, here we go. </line>


  <line> You want to know about my parents? </line>


  <line> They drank a lot. </line>


  <line> My father was a failed novelist. </line>


  <line> My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for
    it. </line>


  <line> He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records. </line>


  <line> He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp
    because instead of hearty, Christian nails, </line>


  <line> I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails. </line>


  <line> Like I said, totally normal. </line>
