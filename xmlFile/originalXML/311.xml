Good morning, morning.

<nonVerbComm>[humming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Good morning, sun.

Good morning, trees.

</line>


<line>
Good morning, busy buzzy bees.

</line>


<line>
Good morning, Sarah Lynn.

Good to see you, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
The tulips and chrysanthemums

are really coming in.

</line>


<line>
Good morning, handsome garden ants.

</line>


<line>
I like the way you plant my plants.

</line>


<line>
Your flowers make my feelings dance.

I like your handsome planter pants.

</line>


<line>
Goddamn it!

Why won't you--? [groans]

</line>


<line>
It's okay.

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn, you are calm,

you are thin.

</line>


<line>
Your skin is so soft, it's like you

murdered a baby and stole its skin.

</line>


<line>
Your skin is "murdered-baby" soft.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Blueberry, goji berry, flax,

chia, shark fin, and... white rhino horn.

</line>


<line>
Sober, so good.

</line>


<line>
-[phone vibrating]

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack?

-Hey, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
-You wanna party?

-Oh, thank God. Yes!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, hand me the açai.

</line>


<line>
-Is that how you pronounce it?

-Who knows?

</line>


<line>
They should really just call them

"overpriced blueberries for douchebags."

</line>


<line>
-Ow.

-How's life?

</line>


<line>
-Well, the truth is that...

-Didn't catch that, but everything's cool?

</line>


<line>
No. In fact, I've never felt so alone--

</line>


<line>
Sorry, missed it!

You should learn to talk louder, dude!

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, bummer about you

getting the nomination,

but then, it turning out

that you didn't get the nomination.

</line>


<line>
It was big news yesterday.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I got royally screwed,

know who was there for me?

</line>


<line>
No one, because everyone's an asshole

and the whole world sucks balls.

</line>


<line>
-Anyway, thanks for having me over.

-I'm with you, man.

</line>


<line>
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.

Why would I make my body a temple?

</line>


<line>
I've been to Temple.

Temple is super boring.

</line>


<line>
What do you say

we go on an epic bender?

</line>


<line>
Yes! Let's get higher

than a stilt walker's dick!

</line>


<line>
That's what I'm talking about.

Let's get some booze and drugs.

</line>


<line>
We can clear out my bank account.

I got nothing left I care about.

</line>


<line>
What do you mean "get"?

This whole house is booze and drugs.

</line>


<line>
-Here.

-Yogurt-covered raisins?

</line>


<line>
-Nope. Vicodin-covered Vicodin.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-LSD.

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
-Yah! Crystal meth.

-Ha-ha!

</line>


<line>
Ee-yah!

[snorting]

</line>


<line>
Cocaine-- No! That's drywall.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Where the hell

did I hide the cocaine?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, I also told

the liquor store to deliver.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

To nine months of sobriety.

</line>


<line>
To life and being done with it!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay. What about this one?

</line>


<line>
Remember when Erika Eleniak

guest starred as Goober's cousin

from out of town,

and Brad had a boner

for the whole episode?

</line>


<line>
-What? No.

-You can totally see it in every scene.

</line>


<line>
Cold open, boner! Act one, boner!

</line>


<line>
Commercial break-- "Hello, we're from

the Wheaties corporation!" Back to boners!

</line>


<line>
Okay, we'll put it on the list.

We gotta watch that one.

</line>


<line>
What about the one where the writers

made Joelle dress up like a pumpkin,

and the whole episode was fat jokes,

so then Joelle got an eating disorder?

</line>


<line>
Everything was so much simpler back then.

</line>


<line>
She had to go to a clinic.

She missed, like, five episodes.

</line>


<line>
We didn't know how good we had it.

</line>


<line>
We got to come to work

and have fun every day,

and we weren't worried

about our legacy or awards.

</line>


<line>
...because buildings are supposed

to be rectangles, goddamn it!

</line>


<line>
Wait, what were we talking about?

</line>


<line>
We were talking about <ital>Horsin' Around.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Then, you had to go pee.

</line>


<line>
Then, you came back

covered in toilet paper

and pretended to be a mummy.

</line>


<line>
Then, you took it all off

because you decided Egypt was stupid,

especially pyramids,

because you think triangle buildings are,

and I quote, "gauche as shit."

</line>


<line>
That does sound like me,

but I don't remember any of that.

</line>


<line>
I must have blacked out.

Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for--

</line>


<line>
...and I said, "You're sitting

on the pizza, Mr. President."

</line>


<line>
-Whoa! I think I just had another one.

-Another what? Pizza?

</line>


<line>
No, blackout. The thing

we were just talking about.

</line>


<line>
-Try to keep up here.

-Oh...

</line>


<line>
Boom! Boner! Pay up!

What did I tell you?

</line>


<line>
That's not a boner. It's a shadow.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, I think we all learned</ital>

<ital>a valuable lesson today</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>about the Armenian genocide.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Armenian genocide</ital>

<ital>was too much, man!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
All right! Next episode.

</line>


<line>
Why can't life be like it was

on <ital>Horsin' Around?</ital>

</line>


<line>
All our issues conveniently settled

in 22 hilarious minutes.

</line>


<line>
You know, it's amazing

that it's legal for kids to be actors.

</line>


<line>
How is that not child labor?

I didn't know what I was signing up for.

</line>


<line>
-I was three.

-This is getting me depressed.

</line>


<line>
-Let's do something fun.

-Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass?

</line>


<line>
The planetarium!

</line>


<line>
You get crazy high in the parking lot,

then you go in and get your mind blown

by all the trippy galaxies and shit.

</line>


<line>
That sounds stupid.

I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[snorting]</nonVerbComm>

No, no, no! That was drywall.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, we have to start

marking our drugs more clearly.

</line>


<line>
-Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.

-Whoo!

</line>


<line>
-[male voice] It was just so hard.

-Wha--? What the--?

</line>


<line>
I was stuck in a terrifying cycle

of drinking, lifting my head up,

drinking, lifting my head up,

drinking, lifting my head up.

</line>


<line>
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs

telling boring stories about themselves?

</line>


<line>
-Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting?

-Now, you're a detective?

</line>


<line>
Last night, you couldn't even solve

the mystery of where the toilet is.

</line>


<line>
So, all our partying was

an elaborate trick

just to get me to go sober?

</line>


<line>
No, Detective Pukes

in the Washing Machine.

</line>


<line>
You're here because I couldn't

leave you alone in my house,

and I had to come today.

</line>


<line>
Gotta get my nine-month chip.

</line>


<line>
Chip? We've been wasted for...

31 hours?

</line>


<line>
That's no reason for me

to not get my chip.

</line>


<line>
That's literally exactly the reason

you shouldn't get your chip.

</line>


<line>
Nowhere in the 12 steps

does it say to not drink.

</line>


<line>
That's not actually one of the steps.

Loophole.

</line>


<line>
Take a swig.

</line>


<line>
If you have to listen to losers talk

about their shitty sober lives,

it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.

</line>


<line>
And I realized people don't change

because they want to change.

</line>


<line>
They change because they have to change.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God. Boo!

</line>


<line>
Oh, booing is generally

frowned upon here.

</line>


<line>
How else am I supposed to express

how boring these stories are?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[speaking slowly]</nonVerbComm>

My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm>

Hi, Simon.

</line>


<line>
My rock bottom was

when I actually woke up under a rock.

</line>


<line>
Can't get lower than that.

</line>


<line>
Come on!

You people call yourself drunks?

</line>


<line>
Most of this is stuff I do

on a daily basis completely sober.

</line>


<line>
Trust me, pal,

we've done some awful things.

</line>


<line>
One time, I didn't want

my friend to move out,

so I used character actress Ann Dowd

to help me sabotage his hip-hopera.

</line>


<line>
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.

</line>


<line>
You so-called drunks want

something to feel shitty about?

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, maybe we should go.

-I got somethin' for ya. Whoa.

</line>


<line>
My name is BoJack.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm>

Hi, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Oh, like you didn't know?

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I once went all the way down

to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew,

and she had a young daughter, Penny.

</line>


<line>
Penny Carson. That's her real name.

You can look her up. I don't care.

</line>


<line>
And first, I tried to sleep

with the mom, but she said no.

</line>


<line>
-Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.

-[all groaning]

</line>


<line>
Then, the mom walked in on me

trying to sleep with the daughter,

and I was like,

"Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"

</line>


<line>
Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
The worst part is, I don't even know

what happened after I left.

</line>


<line>
Did I ruin the family?

Did I scar that little girl for life?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
And that's just, like,

one of a billion things

that I have going through my head

all the time.

</line>


<line>
So, anyone got a better story than that?

</line>


<line>
Wow.

</line>


<line>
Didn't think so, bitches.

</line>


<line>
Where's my trophy, or chip,

or whatever?

</line>


<line>
-[screams]

-[car horn honking]

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-[screams]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[tires squealing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
That was impressive, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I've never seen them cancel an AA meeting

because everyone got bummed out before.

</line>


<line>
Uh, what are you talking about?

</line>


<line>
You told everyone about that Penny chick.

</line>


<line>
Then, you went on and on

about how you're never going to change.

</line>


<line>
Then, you chased the slug around,

threatening to pour salt on his head.

</line>


<line>
-I talked about Penny?

-Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.

</line>


<line>
-[tires squealing]

-[loud crash]

</line>


<line>
Most of us aren't as proud of it

as you seem to be.

</line>


<line>
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible that

I might have really messed that girl up.

</line>


<line>
Oh, she's fine.

I looked her up on Facebook.

</line>


<line>
She's going to Oberlin,

likes Thai food and the smell of a fire

on the first really cold day of winter.

</line>


<line>
That doesn't mean anything.

Everyone likes the smell of fire

on the first cold day of winter.

</line>


<line>
You know, I used to feel just like you

before I got into this "12 steps" thing.

</line>


<line>
They taught me how to make amends.

</line>


<line>
You just say you're sorry

for the things you did

and you get a clean slate.

</line>


<line>
-So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.

-Then, you just make amends again.

</line>


<line>
It's a never-ending cycle,

where you always end up

feeling good about yourself.

</line>


<line>
-[man] No!

-You know what?

</line>


<line>
This may be the nitrous

and bath salts talking,

but I want to do some more

nitrous and bath salts.

</line>


<line>
-[tires squealing]

-[crash]

</line>


<line>
And then, let's make

some goddamn amends.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you should start with the family

whose playhouse you just smashed.

</line>


<line>
-[crying] Oh, no!

-Oh. Hey, kid!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry your lame dad built

such a cheap-ass playhouse!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints

to support that foundation, dumbshit!

</line>


<line>
-Also, suck a dick!

-You know what? I do feel better.

</line>


<line>
-[laughing]

-[crying]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-I don't think they're home.

-So, we wait.

</line>


<line>
I need to make amends to Diane,

and we're not leaving until I do.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm> But it's boring out here,

and I'm hungry and I'm bored!

</line>


<line>
I bet they have food inside.

</line>


<line>
Let's see if I still have

that spare key. Here it is.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-Yes!

</line>


<line>
Okay, after we get food,

remind me that this is another thing

I need to make amends for.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs, burps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Where are those two?

</line>


<line>
They did not keep their fridge

stocked enough

for two stoned people

waiting around for hours.

</line>


<line>
It's only been, like, ten minutes.

You have a real thing with food.

</line>


<line>
That's what happens when you mix

the appetite of a horse

with the appetite of someone

with a hole inside him

that needs to be constantly filled

with attention, food, and sex.

</line>


<line>
-Pass the Bugles.

-There's no more Bugles.

</line>


<line>
There's no more of anything.

Let's just go.

</line>


<line>
-I can't leave until I make amends.

-[gasps] I got a idea!

</line>


<line>
My name is BoJack's friend What's-Her-Face

and I wear glasses.

</line>


<line>
Do you have something

to say to me, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
-Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?

-You can be anyone you want.

</line>


<line>
This is your dream... dream... dream...

</line>


<line>
Stop doing that. We're both awake.

Let's just get to this.

</line>


<line>
Diane, I'm sorry

I said mean things to you.

</line>


<line>
That's cool. I forgive you.

Wait, would my character say that?

</line>


<line>
What's Diane's deal again?

She's, like, an Asian Daria?

</line>


<line>
-She's a little more complex.

-But she's basically Asian Daria, right?

</line>


<line>
With the glasses and the jacket

and her whole "blah" thing.

</line>


<line>
Okay, shut up.

Now, I'll be Mr. Peanutbutter

and you make amends to me.

</line>


<line>
Who's Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
And, now, you be Mr. Carolyn

and I'll be Princess Diana.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah. Good idea.

-[both grunting]

</line>


<line>
Um... should we do something about this?

</line>


<line>
Hey, why don't you two

sleep this off in our guest room?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us!

</line>


<line>
You can't stop us, us from the future!

</line>


<line>
-We're making amends, assholes!

-[screaming]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both groan]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Ow! Come on!

</line>


<line>
-That felt so good!

-See?

</line>


<line>
When you make amends,

don't you just feel lighter?

</line>


<line>
Well, I also ate

a shit ton of Bugles, so no.

</line>


<line>
But I do feel like we got to the bottom

of who really killed Princess Di.

</line>


<line>
-It was all of us.

-Next stop, Todd!

</line>


<line>
Todd, I'm sorry. I want to take

full responsibility for what happened,

even though it is not my fault

and I did nothing wrong.

</line>


<line>
Emily is an adult woman

who can make her own choices.

</line>


<line>
And besides,

are you even really into girls?

</line>


<line>
-I mean, what is your deal?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Hey, what are you doing with our son?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
I am, and this is

my best buddy Todd. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
That movie star has really

taken a shine to our boy.

</line>


<line>
You think this is our big break?

</line>


<line>
You don't think he's inappropriately

interested, do you?

</line>


<line>
What? No. But if he is,

that could also be a big break.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-[stammering]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, wait!

-Hold on. Where are you going?

</line>


<line>
-Come back.

-You want to take Todd for a sleepover?

</line>


<line>
-Sleepover?

-No offense, Todd,

but your parents are creeping me out.

</line>


<line>
To the next amends!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screaming]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-What do you want, BoJack?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
I'm very drunk and a little nauseous,

but if I'm here in your house,

it must be to make amends.

</line>


<line>
-Amends... for what?

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Whatever it is that you think I did

to make you disappear.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack--

-How could you leave me like that

when I needed you most?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, BoJack. I thought

you were a winner. I was wrong.

</line>


<line>
This is hard for me, too.

I staked my reputation--

</line>


<line>
No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.

</line>


<line>
How could you think

that this is about the Oscar campaign?

</line>


<line>
We had something more, didn't we?

</line>


<line>
-You've been drinking.

-Well, not just drinking.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[snorting]</nonVerbComm>

Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.

</line>


<line>
Whoa! I am a broken,

screwed-up misfit toy,

and you act all in control,

but I know that, deep down,

you're broken, too.

</line>


<line>
And I don't know why you won't just

give us a chance to be broken together.

</line>


<line>
What about that doesn't appeal to you?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack, when I was in college,

I had a job as a lifeguard...

</line>


<line>
Wait, did we just go to Ana's house?

Did I get closure?

</line>


<line>
If by "closure" you mean

I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.

</line>


<line>
We gotta go back.

</line>


<line>
-What the hell?

-I know I was just here,

but I feel like you told me

some important story

that explained everything about us.

</line>


<line>
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.

</line>


<line>
Gotta be honest.

I've had a couple beers.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again,

if it'll make you leave.

</line>


<line>
When I was a lifeguard, I...

</line>


<line>
-Oh, crud.

-You want to go back to Ana's, don't you?

</line>


<line>
I feel like I'll definitely

get it this time.

</line>


<line>
Lifeguard...

</line>


<line>
-One more time?

-No. This time I wrote it down.

</line>


<line>
"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's house

smells weird, or is that me?

</line>


<line>
Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
Don't do that thing

where you write down your thoughts

instead of what the person

is actually saying.

</line>


<line>
I wonder if it's time to get

my boobs done again."

</line>


<line>
-Mm-hmm.

-[inhales] That's very helpful.

</line>


<line>
Thank you. Who's next?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[door sliding closed]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, so I know

I keep bothering you tonight.

</line>


<line>
Tonight? I haven't seen you

in two weeks.

</line>


<line>
Oh, really?

</line>


<line>
I just need to know what you were

trying to tell me about being a lifeguard,

and then, I'll leave

and you'll never see me again.

</line>


<line>
Mmm...

</line>


<line>
After I almost drowned, I decided

I would never again be weaker than water.

</line>


<line>
So, I became a lifeguard.

</line>


<line>
On my first day of training,

my instructor told me

that there are going to be times

when you'll see someone in trouble.

</line>


<line>
You're going to want to rush in there

and do whatever you can to save them,

but you have to stop yourself,

because there are some people

you can't save.

</line>


<line>
'Cause those people

will thrash and struggle

and try to take you down with them.

</line>


<line>
What does that have to do with me?

</line>


<line>
What the--?

Where the hell are we now?

</line>


<line>
-Ohi--

-Ojai?

</line>


<line>
-We drove all the way to Ojai?

-Let me finish.

</line>


<line>
Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.

</line>


<line>
-Ohio.

-We drove all the way to Ohio?!

</line>


<line>
I wanted to go to the planetarium,

but you demanded we come here.

</line>


<line>
You said you had to make

one more amend, to that Penny girl.

</line>


<line>
What? No! That is a terrible idea.

</line>


<line>
-Let's turn this car around right now.

-[tires squealing]

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
-I feel we didn't turn the car around.

-No, we did,

but then, you turned it back around

because you really wanted

to find that deer girl,

so we decided to do a stakeout.

</line>


<line>
There was a whole makeover sequence,

where we went to the mall

and tried on different trench coats

for each other.

</line>


<line>
Do you not remember any of that?

</line>


<line>
This is insane.

I already scarred her for life.

</line>


<line>
If I see her again, I'll just end up

getting my horribleness all over her.

</line>


<line>
You think it's too late for me

to go to college?

</line>


<line>
I always wanted to be an architect.

</line>


<line>
But one of those architects,

where, at night,

she's a high-end call girl,

and, by day,

she's an international superspy.

</line>


<line>
-So, when is she an architect?

-I don't know. Frontier times?

</line>


<line>
No, I didn't mean what era.

</line>


<line>
If she's a call girl at night

and a spy during the day--

</line>


<line>
-Hey, look, Penny.

-Oh, God, what's she doing?

</line>


<line>
-Does she look emotionally damaged?

-She's just going to the computer.

</line>


<line>
She's probably in a sex chat room

with some middle-aged horse

because that's the only way

she can still feel love.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, probably.

-Or she's so upset about what you did

that she's using the Internet

to find ways to commit suicide.

</line>


<line>
That makes even more sense.

</line>


<line>
All right, we've established

that you ruined her.

</line>


<line>
-Can we go back to L.A. now?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
So... obviously, I wanted to keep

following Penny because I'm an idiot.

</line>


<line>
Let's just nip this in the bud.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny"

on my hands

in the unlikely scenario

of my blacking out again.

</line>


<line>
I'll just write "Follow Penny"

on this hand,

and then, on this hand, I'll write...

</line>


<line>
-Goddamn it!

-What?

</line>


<line>
We're just doing what the hand said.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Uh, what?

-The hand demanded donuts.

</line>


<line>
-[gasps] There she is.

-She's drinking beer.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God, this is just like

the episode of <ital>Horsin' Around</ital>

when Olivia went to the frat party,

but Penny doesn't have a kind angel

played by Jose Canseco

to help her get out of this jam!

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Okay, now, I'm bored again.

Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.

</line>


<line>
She's just drinking Red Bull.

Wait. Now, she's leaving.

</line>


<line>
-[both gasp]

-Hey, look, it's the Obertones!

</line>


<line>
Love your sound, dudes!

</line>


<line>
She seems... fine.

</line>


<line>
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret

that's eating away at her soul.

</line>


<line>
Or, possibly... she's fine.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you were a father figure,

who was sexually inappropriate to me,

and I turned out perfect.

</line>


<line>
-Now, can we please go home?

-Okay, good plan.

</line>


<line>
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.

Whoa. Look at me, walking good.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all screaming melodically]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No, no, no! Shush, shush.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack?

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Hey, Penny!

</line>


<line>
-Did you come here to find me?

-No, I--

</line>


<line>
You can't be here.

I-I don't want to see you here.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to see you at all.

I was 17. I didn't know any better.

</line>


<line>
-I tried--

-You need to leave.

</line>


<line>
It's BoJack Horseman and Sarah Lynn!

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

-BoJack, we need to get out of here now.

</line>


<line>
Can I get a selfie and another selfie

if the first selfie doesn't look good?

</line>


<line>
-[overlapping chatter]

-BoJack, over here!

</line>


<line>
Penny, no.

</line>


<line>
Penny?

</line>


<line>
You know, on the plus side,

she really seemed okay.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
-Until she saw you and freaked out.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
But she probably would have been

totally fine if you'd never shown up.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, God.

-I think the wound was completely healed

before you reopened it by showing up

unannounced at her college

and all the pain came

rushing back to her.

</line>


<line>
Oh, good Lord!

</line>


<line>
In a way, it's like

you destroyed her life twice.

</line>


<line>
-Will you please stop talking about it?

-Okay, fine.

</line>


<line>
Whoop.

[shivers]

</line>


<line>
Man, Ohio sucks!

</line>


<line>
Next time, could you almost molest

someone who lives in Hawaii?

</line>


<line>
You could be bummed out

at a luau right now.

</line>


<line>
Let's just go home.

</line>


<line>
-You got a bottle opener?

-Glove compartment.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll be a dick sucked by a dumbshit!

What do we have here?

</line>


<line>
Oh, that? Turns out there's

a brand of heroin called BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Dude, that's a big freaking deal.

</line>


<line>
Getting a drug named after you

is cooler than getting an Oscar.

</line>


<line>
I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth,

Angel Dustin Hoffman,

</line>


<line>
Lucille Eightball and now you.

</line>


<line>
It's a rarefied breed, man.

Congratulations!

</line>


<line>
-Thank you?

-Oh, we have to do BoJack!

</line>


<line>
-It's too perfect.

-I don't know.

</line>


<line>
There's that old saying.

"Liquor before beer, never fear.

</line>


<line>
Don't do heroin."

</line>


<line>
"I'm BoJack.

Please, put me inside you."

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna shoot heroin

with you, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
We can snort heroin

like sophisticated adults.

</line>


<line>
Way ahead of you.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[both snorting, sighing]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay, thank you.

Happy Thanksgiving 2007.

</line>


<line>
Why did you just say what year it is?

</line>


<line>
I guess I just get nervous

talking to network executives.

</line>


<line>
This last episode got

the worst ratings yet.

</line>


<line>
I was afraid your character trying heroin

would be a bridge too far.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-And the disjointed blackout structure,

with the one flashback in the middle,

really confused our audience.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
They hated all

the fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.

</line>


<line>
Of course. Audiences hate meta jokes.

When will comedy writers learn?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I know there is an audience

out there for our show.

</line>


<line>
We just need to find a way

to get more people to check us out.

</line>


<line>
I know what you're thinking--

Full frontal.

</line>


<line>
I was thinking guest star.

</line>


<line>
We need a celebrity who

is incredibly popular right now, like--

</line>


<line>
-Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?

-Ooh, that's genius!

</line>


<line>
Sarah Lynn? I don't know.

I haven't spoken to her in years.

</line>


<line>
Besides, she's not gonna

want to do this.

</line>


<line>
She's the world's biggest pop star.

</line>


<line>
She's the only hope we have

to keep this show alive.

</line>


<line>
Would you ask her?

I'm sure she'd do it for you.

</line>


<line>
You're like a father to her.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[screams, groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[moaning]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-So, what is it?

-What is what?

</line>


<line>
You were mumbling about

how you had to ask me something.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, how long

have we known each other?

</line>


<line>
-Feels like our entire lives.

-Well, my entire life, pretty much.

</line>


<line>
We were on a TV show.

Isn't that insane?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

</line>


<line>
You know, sometimes it feels like you're

the only one who really understands me,

because how could anyone else?

</line>


<line>
Nobody knows what we went through,

nobody who wasn't on that show.

</line>


<line>
But we knew each other

before we were anybody,

and that's how we can be friends,

because we're not like those other people.

</line>


<line>
The people who glom onto you

because of who they think you are,

and they think they can sleep

on your couch and eat your food.

</line>


<line>
They think you're gonna

save their agency.

</line>


<line>
I never asked for that kind of pressure,

but you and me, we don't want

anything from each other.

</line>


<line>
You know, I... I could never

figure out what love meant,

but, right now, I don't need

to figure out anything.

</line>


<line>
I just feel it.

I love you, Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
-[siren blaring in distance]

-Sarah Lynn?

</line>


<line>
-Sarah Lynn?

-What?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay!

-I'm not okay. I'm bored.

</line>


<line>
This hotel room is boring!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

What's on TV?

</line>


<line>
-[gasps] The Oscars are on.

-Really?

</line>


<line>
-How long have we been on this bender?

-I love the Oscars.

</line>


<line>
The red carpet, the fashion,

all the magic of Hollywoo

wrapped up in one exciting night.

</line>


<line>
<ital>And the winner</ital>

<ital>for Best Original Song is...</ital>

<ital>And if you're watching this,</ital>

<ital>Sarah Lynn,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>wherever you are,</ital>

<ital>please come home.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[exhales sharply]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, I should have been there.

</line>


<line>
When I was a kid,

if you'd told me I'd win an Oscar,

</line>


<line>
I'd never have believed it.

</line>


<line>
And, now, I've done it and...

</line>


<line>
BoJack... I don't...

like anything about me.

</line>


<line>
-Hey.

-None of this is me.

</line>


<line>
These boobs aren't me.

</line>


<line>
-This house isn't me.

-We're not at your house right now.

</line>


<line>
The only reason I wear this shirt

is because some company

paid me $8,000 to wear it.

</line>


<line>
And I don't even need the money.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> I just liked that someone

still wanted me to wear their shirt.

</line>


<line>
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

Everything's gonna be okay.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do?

I don't know what to do.

</line>


<line>
Am I doomed? Are you doomed?

Are we all doomed?

</line>


<line>
No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.

</line>


<line>
And I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

We're gonna go to the planetarium.

</line>


<line>
Really?

</line>

more than just the six stars

you can see in the Los Angeles sky.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's cool, too,

but I meant this building.

</line>


<line>
It's a giant dome.

Domes are so cool.

</line>


<line>
I prefer rectangular buildings,

as I firmly established.

See, Sarah Lynn, we're not doomed.

</line>


<line>
In the great grand scheme of things,

we're just tiny specks

that will one day be forgotten.

</line>


<line>
So, it doesn't matter what we did

in the past, or how we'll be remembered.

</line>


<line>
The only thing that matters

is right now, this moment,

this one spectacular moment

we are sharing together.
