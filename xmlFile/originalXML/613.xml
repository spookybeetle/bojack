<nonVerbComm>[line ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[voicemail]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</ital>

[beeps]

</line>


<line>
Hey, Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
Um, you still haven't returned

my last call, which is fine.

</line>


<line>
I just... I know you're going back

to school soon,

and you should know I won't be there.

</line>


<line>
Because of... everything

you've probably heard about.

</line>


<line>
So, if you were worried

you'd have to see me, you won't.

</line>


<line>
But I would love to talk.

</line>


<line>
-It's BoJack.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Welcome to Burritos and Mo!</ital>

<ital>Home of burritos and much, much mo!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Give me a large number three.

<ital>-Oh, my God. Ellie! Look at the monitor.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's fricking BoJack Horseman.</ital>

<ital>Don't worry, I muted it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[Ellie] <ital>He looks like crap.</ital>

<ital>-Yeah. His tie is all loosened up,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>which is like the universal sign</ital>

<ital>for having a shitty day.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ellie]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Probably because he just came</ital>

<ital>from court. It's all over the news.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He just settled with Sarah Lynn's family</ital>

<ital>for five million dollars.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Makes sense. He seemed like</ital>

<ital>a real psycho in that interview</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-he did a few months back.</ital>

-Yeah. Guys.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ellie]</nonVerbComm> <ital>I'm surprised he'd still</ital>

<ital>wanna show his face in public.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-[man] <ital>His face is everywhere.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-The cover of every magazine.</ital>

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Even got the number-one slot</ital>

<ital>for Hundred Most Hatted Men.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No, it--

-[Ellie] <ital>Most Hatted Men? What is that?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[man]</nonVerbComm> <ital>List of men in hats, I guess.</ital>

<ital>He was wearing a fedora.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It was Most Hated Men!

</line>


<line>
-[Ellie gasps]

-[man] <ital>What?</ital>

</line>


<line>
It was the Hundred Most Hated Men,

it was a newsboy cap,

and I can hear everything

you've been saying!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Ellie]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Uh...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[man] <ital>Get his bags, Ellie!</ital>

<ital>-You said you muted it!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[BoJack grunting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[man] Have a burrito-ful day!

-[man 2] Hey! [grunts] You suck, asshole!

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-[theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[bleating]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I don't think it's wise

to be burning Bridges at this juncture.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.

</line>


<line>
-Greetings, strangers!

-Maude?

</line>


<line>
That's what they want you to think!

</line>


<line>
I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,

we have never met before,

and I'd be delighted to accept a job

at this company.

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs] What?

-As you know, I have 12 children.

</line>


<line>
What sort of day care services

do you provide here?

</line>


<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

</line>


<line>
Todd? At the office?

</line>


<line>
Can we wrap whatever this is up?

</line>


<line>
I'm supposed to head over

to the "Birthday Dad" set.

</line>


<line>
I wanna run a day care at VIM!

</line>


<line>
I've mastered the art of looking

at one baby and I'm ready for more.

</line>


<line>
You do have several employees

with children.

</line>


<line>
If you employ Todd through the company,

</line>


<line>
you could offer him a raise

and still save money on taxes.

</line>


<line>
Great. It's done.

</line>


<line>
Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!

</line>


<line>
Plus, we can carpool to the office.

</line>


<line>
Which leads me to my next point.

I am moving out to live with Maude.

</line>


<line>
It's me! It's Maude.

I don't really have a twin sister.

</line>


<line>
Hey, that's fantastic!

Where are you moving to?

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
-You can stay here! Live with me forever!

-[director] Cut!

</line>


<line>
The line is,

"Thank you for the birthday pizza.

</line>


<line>
Today, I am your dad."

</line>


<line>
-Oh, sorry!

-Let's take five?

</line>


<line>
-Hey, champ. Everything okay?

-I'm just distracted.

</line>


<line>
Ever since Pickles left, I've been

so lonely in that big, empty house.

</line>


<line>
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,

someone to take care of.

</line>


<line>
Princess Carolyn,

you're perpetually alone.

</line>


<line>
-How do you manage?

-One day at a time, buddy.

</line>


<line>
I went to the doctor to see

if he could make me feel better,

he said, "You should check out

this Internet meme,

it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."

</line>


<line>
And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."

</line>


<line>
Guys, I'm really sorry

this keeps happening.

</line>


<line>
When I got home, I found my wife

and daughter had moved out.

</line>


<line>
All they left behind was this picture.

</line>


<line>
-Okay. Rude.

-Shh!

</line>


<line>
It's the stock photo

that came in the frame.

</line>


<line>
My wife kept asking me to put in a picture

of our family, but I was always too drunk.

</line>


<line>
But because of all of you

and my sponsor Leo,

</line>


<line>
I'm no longer just the man

who's not in this picture.

</line>


<line>
I'm a different, better man

who is also not in this picture.

</line>


<line>
Who's next?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Um, okay, I'll speak.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Things have been pretty brutal

for me lately.

</line>


<line>
-Most people hate me...

-Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
...I just lost five million dollars,

so that's not great.

</line>


<line>
Could probably use a Leo

of my own right about now.

</line>


<line>
Wow, tough room.

</line>


<line>
This AA meeting is a tough room.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Um...

</line>


<line>
I know what you're thinking,

"Vance Waggoner?

</line>


<line>
That guy's gonna be my sponsor?

</line>


<line>
The guy Charlie Sheen

once called 'a little much'?"

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-"Vance Waggoner?

</line>


<line>
That guy's got more domestic assault

convictions than Sean Penn!"

</line>


<line>
And now you're thinking,

</line>


<line>
"Did Sean Penn get convicted

of domestic assault

or was it just alleged?

I gotta look that up later."

</line>


<line>
-I'm sure--

-Now you're thinking,

</line>


<line>
"Why would someone this cool

and put-together wanna sponsor me,

</line>


<line>
-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"

-That's not--

</line>


<line>
Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.

And everyone abandoned me.

</line>


<line>
If you need someone to talk to,

give me a call, okay?

</line>


<line>
My number is 555-555-8008.

</line>


<line>
Because sometimes

life turns you upside-down,

and when you're upside-down,

my number is boobs.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
Diane! How are the revisions going?

</line>


<line>
Good! Usually at this stage

I hate everything I've ever written

and I feel like a worthless hack,

but this book actually isn't terrible.

</line>


<line>
Great, so when can we expect

the not-terrible sequel,

</line>


<line>
"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun

but I'm a grown-up writer.

</line>


<line>
<ital>There are other things I wanna write.</ital>

<ital>Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Interesting.

-I didn't even tell you the thing.

</line>


<line>
I know.

I was interested in you not telling me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, good bit.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime,

if you're interested in writing books

that people actually read,

you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:

Last Tran to Clarksville."

</line>


<line>
-Eleanor Roosevelt once--

<ital>-Interesting!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[disconnect tone]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[audience laughing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[woman]</nonVerbComm> <ital>And those congressional</ital>

<ital>turd-weasels</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>actually called this legislation</ital>

<ital>the "Anti-Corruption Bill!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That's like if BoJack Horseman</ital>

<ital>wore a T-shirt that said,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>"I am not a ginormous dick-weasel!"</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, that is an unfair drive-by!

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now, I know this Photoshop is not up</ital>

<ital>to our program's usual standards,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but in our graphic department's defense,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>none of them could spend ten minutes</ital>

<ital>looking at this ass-weasel</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>without their uteruses</ital>

<ital>literally throwing up.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[phone ringing, buzzing]

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
-[beeps]

-Yes?

</line>


<line>
BoJack, it's your very good

accountant Gaz.

</line>


<line>
-I'm here with...

-Your very good lawyer Chaz!

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement

isn't gonna kill us.

</line>


<line>
What's the bad news?

</line>


<line>
The bad news is you're being sued

for a hundred million dollars.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Remember in your interview,

when you disparagingly referred

to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?

</line>


<line>
The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate

being implicated

in your untoward behavior.

</line>


<line>
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death

cost me five million dollars,

but saying something bad about a brand

is gonna cost me a hundred million?

</line>


<line>
When you frame it that way,

it almost seems comical!

</line>


<line>
But it is not comical,

because a hundred million dollars

is a lot of money you do not have.

</line>


<line>
Okay, so what's the move?

</line>


<line>
-Funny you should mention "move."

-[doorbell rings]

</line>


<line>
Your accountant told me

 you wanted to sell your house?

</line>


<line>
-Okay, I'm gonna call you back.

-So, I sold your house!

</line>


<line>
Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures!

</line>


<line>
-You sold my house?

-Golly, are you...?

</line>


<line>
Sylvester Stallion.

From the Rocky movies.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Hey, you kids wanna go check out

the pool?

</line>


<line>
-[boy] Yeah!

-[girl] I love my new life!

</line>


<line>
You sold my house?

</line>


<line>
I found this sweet, sweet family from Ohio

whose kid just got cast in a movie!

</line>


<line>
I wanted to make sure the ink dried

on the mortgage

before they find out the movie's

being shot in Saskatchewan. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
So, where do I go?

</line>


<line>
What do I look like, a real estate agent?

</line>


<line>
-Wait.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Your mail came.

</line>


<line>
-Now leave. You're harshing the buzz.

-But...

</line>


<line>
Huh?

</line>


<line>
-Well, I'm all moved in.

-[sighs] Me too.

</line>


<line>
Wow! Got a promotion

and my own apartment all in the same day.

</line>


<line>
-I never realized my boyfriend was butter.

-You're right. I am on a roll!

</line>


<line>
What should I do next?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Chavez residence, this is Jorge.

Please state the purpose of your call

so I can most appropriately

modulate my tone.

</line>


<line>
Hey, it's Todd. Is Mom there?

</line>


<line>
Ah! Todd! Yes.

</line>


<line>
Oh. She's resting at the moment.

Can I take a message?

</line>


<line>
I just wanted her to know that

I don't have anything to prove to her,

but I got a new job and an apartment,

so if I did have something

to prove to her,

</line>


<line>
-I'd have proven it by now.

-Well, that's wonderful, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Yes. And quite mature.

And she won't even talk to me.

</line>


<line>
-Does she know I'm butter?

-I'm glad to hear you're on a roll.

</line>


<line>
We'd love to see your home

once you're settled.

</line>


<line>
What's that supposed to mean?

I'm settled! I'm a grown-ass Todd!

</line>


<line>
-No, I just meant--

-I don't need to impress you!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you come

to my fancy, sophisticated

housewarming party tomorrow night

and see for yourself!

</line>


<line>
Consider us there. What can we bring?

</line>


<line>
-Two chairs!

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
We could throw together a party, right?

</line>


<line>
Um...

</line>


<line>
-No.

-I need a job.

</line>


<line>
There are no offers.

</line>


<line>
-Can you check? Ask around?

-I'm checking. I'm asking around.

</line>


<line>
-[gasps] There are no offers.

-But I'm broke and homeless.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[scoffs]</nonVerbComm> I can get you a small role

on "Birthday Dad."

</line>


<line>
Great. Have my pages delivered

to me at the Chateau Marmoset.

</line>


<line>
-You just said you're broke!

-And homeless.

</line>


<line>
You are not staying at a fancy hotel.

</line>


<line>
Who else would have me?

</line>


<line>
You could stay here! Live with me forever!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-[sizzling]

-[Mr. Peanutbutter humming]

</line>


<line>
And flip! Morning, sunshine!

</line>


<line>
I hope I didn't wake you

with the delicious smell

of a well-balanced breakfast.

</line>


<line>
-Less talky. More coffee.

-You got it, roomie!

</line>


<line>
-Coffee maker, make!

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
Took the liberty of doing your laundry

and this letter was in your pocket.

</line>


<line>
-[gasps, screams]

-Ooh-hoo! A mysterious pen pal!

</line>


<line>
Is it a secret admirer

or the snowman killer still at large?

</line>


<line>
It's from Hollyhock. But... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
I can't open it. What if she says

she never wants to hear from me again?

</line>


<line>
Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV

three months ago. What's new, BoJack?"

</line>


<line>
I should just call her.

</line>


<line>
If I could talk to her,

I feel like I could explain that--

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[voicemail]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</ital>

<ital>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[voicemail beeps]

-Hey, Hollyhock. It's me again.

</line>


<line>
And his good friend and roommate

and coworker, Mr. Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
It's our first day of work together!

</line>


<line>
I got your letter

and I haven't read it yet,

but I'm going to and...

</line>


<line>
It's really great to hear your voice...

your voicemail voice.

</line>


<line>
-Just give me a call. It's BoJack.

-[beeps]

</line>


<line>
-Ready to go?

-What about this breakfast?

</line>


<line>
We don't have time for that!

You can feed me while I drive, let's go!

</line>


<line>
<ital>-<music>♪ Precision... ♪</music></ital>

-[Todd] Oh, whoa!

</line>


<line>
-Easy. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

-[kids giggling]

</line>


<line>
Hey, Judah. I need your advice.

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to throw

a sophisticated adult party

to impress my parents

and I have no furniture

or sophisticated adult friends.

</line>


<line>
I'm alarmed. Do you not consider me

a sophisticated adult or a friend?

</line>


<line>
Judah, this is no time for one

of your famous Judah tantrums!

</line>


<line>
 Sounds like you need to throw together

a scheme in a short amount of time.

</line>


<line>
In situations like this, I often think,

</line>


<line>
-"What would Todd do?"

-And?

</line>


<line>
He'd probably scour VIM's talent list

for underemployed actors,

tell them they've been hired

for a site-specific immersive

theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,

invite just enough real friends

to lend it an air of legitimacy

and raid the "Birthday Dad" set

for furniture.

</line>


<line>
That's brilliant!

Todd, I've done it again!

</line>


<line>
-Let's go, babies!

-[giggling]

</line>


<line>
Uh... Babies. Come on!

</line>


<line>
-[trunk trumpets]

-[giggling continues]

</line>


<line>
War.

</line>


<line>
And for what?

</line>


<line>
-A couple trophies? A parade?

-[BoJack groans]

</line>


<line>
No. Not for me.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I'm just a crazy,

old birthday person,

</line>


<line>
-but I think war is bad.

-[bell rings]

</line>


<line>
Great job, Mr. Peanutbutter.

You're changing hearts and minds.

</line>


<line>
Isn't this great? Working together?

</line>


<line>
For the next take,

can we get Dead Body Number Four

to face away from the camera?

</line>


<line>
-Oh! That's you!

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-Exciting!

-[grunts, groans]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[director]</nonVerbComm> All the way away

from the camera.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[grunts, groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[muffled]</nonVerbComm> I can't really breathe.

</line>


<line>
That's okay. Let's run it again.

</line>


<line>
-[screams]

-Cool dressing room.

</line>


<line>
And great work on that scene.

</line>


<line>
You really seemed like

a hollowed-out corpse.

</line>


<line>
Once animated by the fire of life,

now consumed by horror

and regret, and for what?

</line>


<line>
Great. You wanna get dinner?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'd love to, buddy,

but I have like five more scenes to shoot.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Of course, yeah.

I'll see you back at the house then?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Oh! I'm probably going to head

right to Todd's fancy party after work.

</line>


<line>
Todd's having a fancy party?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

we're ready for the scene

where you help an American soldier

and a Taliban insurgent

realize they both have the same birthday.

</line>


<line>
-It's Christmas.

-Ugh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[line ringing]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
BoJack!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm> Greetings, cast!

</line>


<line>
As you know,

you have been hired to play urbane,

civilized party guests.

</line>


<line>
So, if at any point tonight

a "member of the audience"

tries to talk to you,

please say one

of the three following phrases

that elegant adults say all the time:

</line>


<line>
"I'm starting to think smart phones

are actually making us less connected."

</line>


<line>
-Oh, yeah!

-"Well, that's politics for you!"

</line>


<line>
Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes

inside this Applebee's."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[all]</nonVerbComm> Ooh!

</line>


<line>
-Hey!

-Hello.

</line>


<line>
What's that?

</line>


<line>
It's a case of Ass-Jolt,

Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.

</line>


<line>
I don't need them anymore.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.

-You have two options.

</line>


<line>
This sourdough starter

or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice

</line>


<line>
-and then suspended in a bottle.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Why don't we just say

they're both from both of us?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-[woman gasps] Ugh.

-And you don't wanna open it?

</line>


<line>
I'm not ready. As long as I don't read it,

she's still in my life.

</line>


<line>
It's good to have people that remind us

why we stay sober.

</line>


<line>
That's what my daughter is for me.

</line>


<line>
Here's your sandwich.

Chef made it just for you.

</line>


<line>
Hmph, hmph, hmph.

</line>


<line>
Okay, do I have a horn?

</line>


<line>
Because everybody keeps looking at me

like I'm some kind of freak.

</line>


<line>
Well, if you've got a horn,

you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.

</line>


<line>
You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom

because you couldn't get a date

to the marshmallow cotillion.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, or because I snorted up

all the magic fairy glitter.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[deep voice]</nonVerbComm> "This summer:

Dumbass Unicorn."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> That's so stupid.

No, that's exactly what they'd do.

</line>


<line>
It would be like

"Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[normal voice]</nonVerbComm> Yeah, and his horn

is like a corkscrew,

and he tries to open a bottle of wine,

but it gets stuck,

so now he's got this wine bottle

on his head,

just dripping wine down his face,

</line>


<line>
-like... [grunting]

-[laughing]

</line>


<line>
"Nasty Unicorn.

</line>


<line>
He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.'"

</line>


<line>
Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn."

It would be "Horny Unicorn"!

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, that's amazing.

Now we have to do it.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> What do you mean "do it"?

</line>


<line>
The movie. You're the Horny Unicorn.

I'll direct. We're doing it.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I'm not really the guy

people wanna see in movies right now.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, they don't wanna see you

be <ital>Secretariat</ital> or raising orphans.

</line>


<line>
But they will see you be a rude dude

who says all the things polite society

is too limp-dicked to say.

</line>


<line>
This is your way back in.

This is how you get that love back.

</line>


<line>
"The Horny Unicorn"?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.

He's misunderstood.

</line>


<line>
It's not his fault he's the way he is!

</line>


<line>
-And people are gonna see that!

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy!

I never asked to be the horny unicorn!

</line>


<line>
What? You think I like it that

I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes

to keep my horn from going soft?"

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Come on. I know you need the money.

</line>


<line>
When are you gonna stop

punishing yourself?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[video game noises]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Flip it. No, you gotta... [sighs]

Flip the thing. Flip it.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Sonny, do you know

where the advance copy of my book is?

</line>


<line>
Your stupid book about the mall?

</line>


<line>
Haven't seen it.

'Cause I would never even notice it.

</line>


<line>
-'Cause it's for losers. Girl losers.

-[laughing]

</line>


<line>
You can just say losers.

</line>


<line>
Girls can be losers without specifying

that they're girls.

</line>


<line>
Will you let me know if you see it?

I need to get revisions to my publisher.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Sounds like a "you" problem.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sniggering]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Girl loser.

</line>


<line>
-[piano music playing]

-[indistinct chatter]

</line>


<line>
-Hello.

-We're here for the party?

</line>


<line>
We brought a plant.

</line>


<line>
Uh, just one sec.

</line>


<line>
I'm starting to think smart phones

are actually making us less connected.

</line>


<line>
-They are!

-Well, that's politics for you.

</line>


<line>
-It is!

-Hey, man. Uh...

</line>


<line>
-What's going on?

-We're here for the party.

</line>


<line>
We brought a plant.

</line>


<line>
Look... [sighs] BoJack,

don't make me ask you to leave.

</line>


<line>
-You don't have to--

-Come on, dude. Let us in.

</line>


<line>
-This plant's heavy as tits.

-I don't want a whole thing here.

</line>


<line>
My mom is coming

and I haven't spoken to her in ten years,

and I can't risk anything happening.

</line>


<line>
What do you think is going to "happen"?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, man,

but something always happens with you

and usually I've been cool because I know

you're always dealing with your own shit,

but I can't risk it tonight.

</line>


<line>
I'm sober. Nothing is going to happen.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna--

Oh, shit.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
I'll see you around.

</line>


<line>
We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.

</line>


<line>
Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what?

I'm just supposed to go away forever?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

</line>


<line>
This is where you find out

who your real friends are.

</line>


<line>
Part of being sober is leaving behind

all the people

who can't stop seeing you as the person

who pissed in the fountain

</line>


<line>
-at my own daughter's sweet 16.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
You think you owe them something

because they tolerated you at your worst,

but these people enjoy seeing you fail

because it lets them feel superior.

</line>


<line>
They don't know how to process it

when you're no longer the huge screw-up

who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van

to bring my friends to a strip club.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know--

-I do. You know what else I know?

</line>


<line>
You gotta go where the love is.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Maybe.

</line>


<line>
That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn."

</line>


<line>
Because it's gonna make a billion dollars

and drive all those assholes crazy!

</line>


<line>
It would be good to have something

to keep me busy.

</line>


<line>
See? That's what I'm talking about!

</line>


<line>
-There he is! There's my Horn-corn!

-[phone buzzing]

</line>


<line>
-Ah, shit. My daughter's in trouble.

-What is it?

</line>


<line>
You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C.

real quick?

</line>


<line>
EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep

a low profile.

</line>


<line>
-I don't think a college campus--

-BoJack, this is my daughter, okay?

</line>


<line>
She's the one person I care about,

the one thing keeping me sober.

</line>


<line>
-Why do you need me to go with you?

-Unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
When everyone else abandoned you,

who was there for you?

</line>


<line>
When the world judged you

and ridiculed you?

</line>


<line>
And now, the one time

I need something from you...

</line>


<line>
Okay. I'm in.

</line>


<line>
Or as the horny unicorn would say,

"Am I in?"

</line>


<line>
Oh, you're in, baby!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[video game noises]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
No. No. Come on, come on,

come on! Come on!

</line>


<line>
-What the hell, Diane?

-Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, you found my book?

-Yeah, and it sucked. Totally unrealistic.

</line>


<line>
-You read my book?

-I've been reading it.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it

in front of my friends,

because it's a book for girl babies,

but anyways it didn't even make sense!

</line>


<line>
What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
Like, you say the book takes place

in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.

</line>


<line>
Schaumburg, Diane?

Schaumburg's not Chicago.

</line>


<line>
It's in the Chicago metropolitan--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, what's next?!

Evanston, Chicago?

</line>


<line>
Morton Grove, Chicago?

Naperville, Chicago?

</line>


<line>
-That's what you sound like!

-Okay, it's not too late to change it.

</line>


<line>
Good. And while you're at it,

</line>


<line>
-I've got some other questions.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose

that he wasn't her best friend anymore

and Moose said,

"You're still <ital>my</ital> best friend

whether you like it or not..." [sniffs]

</line>


<line>
-was that real?

-What do you mean?

</line>


<line>
Like, did that really happen,

that someone could be

someone's best friend still

even when they're disappointed in them?

</line>


<line>
Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.

</line>


<line>
Okay. And you know how Ivy

kept her dad's watch in her locker

because even though he wasn't around

she still knew that he loved her?

</line>


<line>
-Was that real, too?

-Well, the book is fiction.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, no, I get it, I just...

parts of it felt real, you know?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I know.

</line>


<line>
It's cool that you wrote a book.

I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.

</line>


<line>
Especially girls who, like,

don't have good self-esteem.

</line>


<line>
-I hope so.

-So, when's the next one coming out?

</line>


<line>
Just in case you need me to check it

for other mistakes, you know. [sniffs]

</line>


<line>
Well, if I get started right away,

it should be out by next fall.

</line>


<line>
-Cool. You gotta flip it.

-Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

</line>


<line>
-Jagger! Jagger!

-Shh, shh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe?

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, Dad,

is this seriously happening?

</line>


<line>
-Why are you here?

-You knew what you were doing

when you liked

your mother's Instagram post

of her on the beach

with her new boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-It was a good picture!

</line>


<line>
That's why we're here?

</line>


<line>
Every month,

you get five Instagram likes on my account

and five on your mother's account.

</line>


<line>
You heard what the judge mandated!

</line>


<line>
Hey, man, let's just go. Okay?

People are starting to--

</line>


<line>
-Are you BoJack Horseman?

-No.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, you are.

-NoJack.

</line>


<line>
Were you trying to get my attention?

'Cause you got it now, baby!

</line>


<line>
-Dad!

-The story got picked up by TMZ!

</line>


<line>
You're ruining my life!

</line>


<line>
You're making me look like

a real cuck, Jagger.

</line>


<line>
I'm getting cucked by my own daughter!

</line>


<line>
You don't even know what that word means!

</line>


<line>
I just want you to know,

</line>


<line>
-I think you got a real bum deal.

-Oh, yeah?

</line>


<line>
You got massively sandbagged

in that interview, bro.

</line>


<line>
-You were trying to apologize.

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Everything these days is all

"patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.

</line>


<line>
And, well, I think it's cool

 you're pushing back against that.

</line>


<line>
Well, no, I'm not pushing back.

</line>


<line>
No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.

You can relax here. This is a safe space.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-You're embarrassing me!

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing?

</line>


<line>
Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal?

It came off as disingenuous!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> You know I love my wide array

of L'Oréal products!

</line>


<line>
From game days with the gals

to cram sessions at the creamery,

</line>


<line>
L'Oréal gives me the confidence

to shine my brightest!

</line>


<line>
Do you wanna come back to Delta House?

</line>


<line>
I think those guys

would be super-stoked to meet you.

</line>


<line>
-They'd be stoked?

-Super-stoked.

</line>


<line>
All right, let's get out of here.

</line>


<line>
My daughter sucks, which is surprising

because I did such a good job raising her.

</line>


<line>
Let's make one more stop.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Looking good!

-Well, that's politics for you!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[phone buzzes, beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Your mother isn't feeling well.

</line>


<line>
She's still recovering from her surgery.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Does that mean you're not coming

to my refined, upscale party

that I totally didn't just throw together

only to impress you?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, uh, no.

But thank you for inviting us.

</line>


<line>
Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.

</line>


<line>
I know. Please keep trying.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[beeps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm starting to think that smart phones

are actually making us less connected.

</line>


<line>
And then I passed out in the pool.

Sploosh!

</line>


<line>
Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there

to perform CPR.

</line>


<line>
She still credits me for being the reason

she got sober... that time.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm> Wow.

</line>


<line>
-Who's Lindsay Lohan?

-She's a celebrity from the olden days.

</line>


<line>
Olden days? Jesus.

</line>


<line>
Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna walk this co-ed back

to her room.

</line>


<line>
'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.

</line>


<line>
Are you serious?

You're supposed to be my sponsor.

</line>


<line>
So, what, I gotta hang out

with you all the time?

</line>


<line>
Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow,

we'll set up "Horny Unicorn."

</line>


<line>
Enjoy your people.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
-[camera shutter clicks]

-Hey, man. Hey! No pictures!

</line>


<line>
-Delete that.

-Come on.

</line>


<line>
Hey, no. You come on.

I'm not here to be your cool story later.

</line>


<line>
Okay, sorry.

</line>


<line>
I shouldn't be here.
