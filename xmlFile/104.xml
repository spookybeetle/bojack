And he says-- he says,

"Why the long face?"

</line>


<line>
And I say, "Hey, buddy,

I can't help it."

</line>


<line>
You get that? Long face.

Horses have long faces.

</line>


<line>
I am a horse, my face is long.

You get it, right?

</line>


<line>
[dispassionate murmur]

Good, good.

</line>


<line>
What about

the Rock Hudson stuff?

</line>


<line>
Felt like that flew

over your heads.

</line>


<line>
Did you get that?

</line>


<line>
Keep this up, and the only

thing we're gonna get

is our money back!

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay,

it wasn't that funny.

</line>


<line>
Maybe you didn't get it.

[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Uh, hey, guys, guys--

[clears throat]

</line>


<line>
[stuttering]

<line>
[whinnies]

</line>


<line>
Hey, let me

buy you a drink.

</line>


<line>
Get cancer, jerk wad.

</line>


<line>
You've got some good material,

you really do.

</line>


<line>
The Gorbachev stuff,

it's killer.

</line>


<line>
But you gotta stop asking people

if they get things.

</line>


<line>
But then who do I know

if they got it?

</line>


<line>
They'll laugh.

</line>


<line>
Why are you giving me

advice?

</line>


<line>
Look, I've been doing stand-up

for a year now,

and it's the responsibility

of big shots like me

to always be looking out

for the little guy.

</line>


<line>
Let me buy you a drink.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't drink.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God!

</line>


<line>
Goddamn it, Todd,

clean up your shit.

</line>


<line>
What am I supposed to do,

okay?

</line>


<line>
You don't give me

any closet space.

</line>


<line>
Not my problem.

A better man than you

once said, and I quote,

</line>


<line>
"It's the responsibility

of little guys like you

to be looking out

for big shots like me."

</line>


<line>
Who said that?

</line>


<line>
I don't know, Jesus, Ghandi,

Malcolm-Jamal Warner.

</line>


<line>
Clean up your shit!

Oh!

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Hey, BoJack,

settle a bet.

</line>


<line>
Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?

</line>


<line>
Don't know what that means.

</line>


<line>
Well, I was talking

to Wayne.

</line>


<line>
- Who's Wayne?

- I'm Wayne.

</line>


<line>
Wayne's writing an article

about me for <ital>BuzzFeed.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>BuzzFeed?</ital>

What'll they think of next?

</line>


<line>
Fun fact: Wayne is also

my ex-boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
Ha! You're funny.

</line>


<line>
[Peanutbutter] Pretty cool, eh, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
Diane's writing a book

about you,

</line>


<line>
Wayne's writing

an article about me.

</line>


<line>
We're the same!

</line>


<line>
How could you think that

that's the same?

</line>


<line>
My book will be in libraries

for hundreds of years.

</line>


<line>
Your <ital>BuzzFeed</ital> article

will be crammed

</line>


<line>
between an animated GIF

of a cat falling asleep

</line>


<line>
and a list of fun facts

about <ital>Legally Blonde.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ha! Classic Zoe.

</line>


<line>
I still don't know

what that means.

</line>


<line>
Well, are you familiar

with <ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's House?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Do you mean his sitcom

that coincidentally

</line>


<line>
had the exact same premise

as my sitcom?

</line>


<line>
Not the exact same.

<ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </ital>

featured a pair of twins,

Zoe and Zelda.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Zelda was the sunny,</ital>

<ital>fun-loving extrovert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Look at my pumpkin,

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.

</line>


<line>
[audience] Aww...

</line>


<line>
<ital>Whereas Zoe was the smart,</ital>

<ital>cynical introvert.</ital>

</line>


<line>
My pumpkin's throwing up

because Halloween

encourages excessive consumption

of refined sugar

at a time when obesity rates

are sky high.

</line>


<line>
Plus, Halloween costumes are

a gateway to casual racism.

</line>


<line>
Why don't I keep the knife,

Zo-bo?

<line>
Now, was the show's acting

ham-fisted

and the writing moronic?

</line>


<line>
N-n-no?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda

paradigm rang true.

</line>


<line>
I believe everyone's

either a Zoe or a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
For example, Nixon was a Zoe

and Kennedy, a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
Al Gore, Zoe.

George W. Bush, total Zelda.

</line>


<line>
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,

Zooey and Emily Deschanel.

</line>


<line>
So Zooey's a Zoe?

</line>


<line>
No, Zooey's a Zelda.

Emily's the Zoe.

</line>


<line>
What a crazy world.

</line>


<line>
So which one are you,

BoJack?

</line>


<line>
I think I'm...

above this.

</line>


<line>
Said the Zoe.

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe you're

the third kind of person,

</line>


<line>
whose only function is to drain

the energy and life force

from his host organism.

</line>


<line>
Come on, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Nah, he's right.

I'm pretty much worthless.

</line>


<line>
See? You say something

to someone enough times,

</line>


<line>
and eventually,

he internalizes it.

</line>


<line>
The system works.

</line>


<line>
I don't have a job,

I don't have any prospects.

</line>


<line>
I probably won't ever finish

the rock opera I'm working on.

</line>


<line>
What?

[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Since when are you

working on a rock opera?

</line>


<line>
Oh, no.

Why'd I ask that?

</line>


<line>
Basically, it's <ital>Tommy</ital>

by way of <ital>Cirque du Soleil</ital>

set in space,

with heavy erotic overtones,

and the gripping psychodrama

of a thriller

with plenty of heart

and more than a little humor.

</line>


<line>
I call it

<ital>Newtopia Rising, Book I:</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The Search for a New Utopia.</ital>

</line>


<line>

That was-- and I don't

say this lightly...

worse than a hundred

September 11ths.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you're right.

This was stupid.

</line>


<line>
I don't know

what I was thinking.

</line>


<line>
Well, guess I'll give up

forever.

</line>


<line>
That's the spirit.

</line>


<line>
Now, you have to understand

that as a port city,

</line>


<line>
Liverpool had unique access to

all aspects of American culture,

especially Blues music and its

unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.

</line>


<line>
I thought this story was about

running into Paul McCartney

in the bathroom

at the Golden Globes.

</line>


<line>
It is. I thought you would

appreciate some context.

</line>


<line>
Let's skip that one

for a minute.

</line>


<line>
Tell me about Todd.

</line>


<line>
Todd?

What's to tell?

</line>


<line>
Five years ago, he found his way

into one of my house parties

and never left.

</line>


<line>
And you've never asked him

anything about himself?

</line>


<line>
I've asked him to get a job,

I've asked him to move out.

</line>


<line>
With a little encouragement,

</line>


<line>
I'll bet he could

really flourish.

</line>


<line>
I mean, didn't you have anyone

who helped you

when you were just

starting out?

</line>


<line>
Um, actually, no.

</line>


<line>
Todd clearly thinks

the world of you.

</line>


<line>
Todd thinks the world

of Pop-Tarts.

</line>


<line>
Look, I get that helping other

people is not your thing, but--

</line>


<line>
What? I let Todd live

rent-free in my stately manse.

</line>


<line>
I am his own personal

Mother Teresa.

</line>


<line>
But do you let him stay here

because you're kind

or just because you're terrified

of being alone?

</line>


<line>
[laughing]

That is insane!

</line>


<line>
I would love to be alone.

That is all I want.

</line>


<line>
Mmm...if that were

really true,

</line>


<line>
I don't think you'd be clipping

Todd's wings all the time.

</line>


<line>
What? That's unbelievable.

</line>


<line>
Todd!

</line>


<line>
What?

Clean up my shit?

</line>


<line>
Yes, but also,

I would like to...

help you with your

dumb-ass rock opera.

</line>


<line>
- What?

- I am... supporting you.

</line>


<line>
I-I don't understand.

Oh, my God, are you dying?

</line>


<line>
No. I... think you have great

depth of untapped potential

and I wish to mentor you

in your... art.

</line>


<line>
- Really?

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
Wait, is this going to be

like that time

you promised to take me

ice skating,

and I got really excited

about the ice skating,

but then instead of ice skating,

you left me at home

so you could go

to the strip club

and then you took the strippers

ice skating?

</line>


<line>
- No.

- Then hooray!

</line>


<line>
Let's dig in.

Where to start?

</line>


<line>
Okay, well, the headline is,

I hate it.

</line>


<line>
I hate everything about it.

</line>


<line>
The premise is bad

and the execution is also bad.

</line>


<line>
It's an irredeemable jumble

of shit.

</line>


<line>
Tough but fair.

</line>


<line>
Ahem.

</line>


<line>
That said,

I don't see why

we can't make something

really great here.

</line>


<line>
Okay, thank you.

I'll work on that.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

Are you close?

</line>


<line>
No!

</line>


<line>
- How 'bout now?

- No!

</line>


<line>
Now?

</line>


<line>
You're not even

inside of me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God!

</line>


<line>
Did you get there?

</line>


<line>
[door opening]

</line>


<line>
Okay, so you know

in the second act closer

when the seekers of Newtopia

are in the Turbidians' dungeon

and they learn their ship

</line>


<line>
- has been destroyed?

- No.

</line>


<line>
Well, what if we move that

to the fourth act?

</line>


<line>
I have no idea

what you're talking about,

but that idea is terrible.

</line>


<line>
I hear the note.

Let me see what I can do.

<line>
How can I put this?

</line>


<line>
Imagine if the Holocaust

happened

every four years

like the Olympics.

</line>


<line>
I would rather that happened

than your rock opera.

</line>


<line>
That's not really a note.

</line>


<line>
In fact, none of your notes

have been notes.

</line>


<line>
I feel like you're

not even listening.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well, you know what?

Maybe I would listen

if the Turbidians

had some reason

to enter

the Cave of Swollen Dreams

that didn't break the pact

they made in act one

with Queen Darneesa.

</line>


<line>
You have been listening.

</line>


<line>
Just doesn't make sense.

</line>


<line>
The Turbidians

are a loyal people.

</line>


<line>
They-- they wouldn't

betray their queen.

</line>


<line>
Unless...

</line>


<line>
[both] They were working

for Queen Darneesa,

who gave them a potion

that would counteract

the effects of

the Elixir of Failed Remembrance

so they could bring

the secret knowledge

from the cave back to her,

and then establish Newtopia

as a vassal state

to the Craterman kingdom!

</line>


<line>
Well, don't just sit there!

Get this down!

</line>


<line>
[grunting]

Oh, you like that.

</line>


<line>
You like daddy's good stuff?

</line>


<line>
Not especially.

</line>

</line>


<line>
Did you get there?

</line>


<line>
Okay, what if there isn't

a robot army?

blew this thing wide open.

[laughs] Let's take a break

and get lunch.

</line>


<line>
Wait, you want

to get lunch with me?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, that's right.

</line>


<line>
Is this like the time

you invited me to lunch,

but then, when I got

to the restaurant,

you texted me to tell me

you weren't coming

because you were at a strip club

"eating stripper" for lunch,

and also,

it was my birthday?

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
Then hooray!

</line>


<line>
And that was a last time

I worked with David O. Russell.

</line>


<line>
What's that old expression?

</line>


<line>
"Fool me once, shame on me,

but fool me twice...

fiddle-dee-dee."

</line>


<line>
I do believe

that is the expression.

</line>


<line>
- [phone ringing]

- Ooh, hold on.

</line>


<line>
I gotta take this.

</line>


<line>
Erica, I don't have time

to be charmed to death

right now.

</line>


<line>
So how long have you been

dating Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Is it serious?

I'm only asking for the article.

</line>


<line>
Better question:

How long does it take

to write a <ital>BuzzFeed</ital> article?

</line>


<line>
I want to be thorough.

</line>


<line>
What? Diane, Diane,

Diane, Diane!

</line>


<line>
- Do you know what today is?

- Sunday?

</line>


<line>
It's "burritos as big as your head" day

at El Taco Loco!

</line>


<line>
We gotta go right now!

</line>


<line>
I thought we were going to see

the Diane Arbus show

at LACMA today.

You know I love Diane Arbus.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles]

I see what's happening here.

</line>


<line>
Her name is Diane,

and your name is Diane.

</line>


<line>
That's not what's happening.

</line>


<line>
I can go to the Arbus show

with you, Diane.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I've actually been meaning

to go myself.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man, you guys

are perfect for each other.

</line>


<line>
Why did you ever break up?

</line>


<line>
[nervous laugh]

</line>


<line>
Okay, less yakking,

more snacking.

</line>


<line>
Let's go ride in the car!

[barking]

</line>


<line>
Here's your steak.

</line>


<line>
- Uh, sorry.

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
You mean to tell me

that for a full year

you were on the run

from the Russian mafia?

</line>


<line>
Well,<ital> </ital>a Russian mafia.

</line>


<line>
I can't believe you never

told me any of this stuff.

</line>


<line>
I just thought you were

a dumb freeloader

who ate all my food

and played video games all day.

</line>


<line>
You should have seen me

in high school.

</line>


<line>
There was this one game,

Decapathon.

</line>


<line>
I remember that game.

</line>


<line>
I was up for Dr. Decapitator

in the movie version.

</line>


<line>
They said they wanted

someone hipper,

but the part ended up

going to Robert Downey.

</line>


<line>
- Junior?

- If it was Junior,

</line>


<line>
I would have said, "Junior."

</line>


<line>
That game basically

destroyed my life.

</line>


<line>
I flunked out of school,

my girlfriend left me.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

I didn't stop playing

until my mom

threw me out of the house.

</line>


<line>
I mean, that's when

I first realized, you know,

</line>


<line>
I'm a total screw-up.

</line>


<line>
You're not a screw-up

anymore, Todd.

</line>


<line>
You're about to have

a hit rock opera on your hands.

</line>


<line>
I'm really glad

you think that.

</line>


<line>
I got Princess Carolyn

to invite

</line>


<line>
Virgil Van Cleef

to our next rehearsal.

</line>


<line>
Who in the what Van?

</line>


<line>
Virgil Van Cleef is

the biggest name in rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Okay, think of all

the great rock operas

from the last 20 years.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
He had a piece of all of them.

</line>


<line>
Wow, Todd, are you sure

we're ready for that?

</line>


<line>
Hey, you said yourself

the train is moving,

but if you think

we're not ready,

</line>


<line>
I mean, I'll listen to you.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you've done

enough listening, buddy.

</line>


<line>
Maybe it's about time

I start listening.

</line>


<line>
Well, I feel like--

[phone ringing]

</line>


<line>
Gotta take this.

Hello?

</line>


<line>
Hello?

BoJack Horseman?

</line>


<line>
We have some very delicate

pictures you might

have an interest in not getting

into the wrong hands.

</line>


<line>
I am very happy

with my current

long distance provider,

thank you.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
Now, if you'll excuse me,

I'm having lunch with my friend.

</line>


<line>
<ital>But if you just listen--</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right, gang, when Virgil Van

Cleef gets here, look alive.

</line>


<line>
This could be Todd's big break,

so clap really hard

and laugh at all the jokes,

even if they're not funny,

but also, be careful,

because a lot of things

you might think are jokes

are not jokes,

so, you know, look out.

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
- That was not a joke.

- That was not a real laugh.

</line>


<line>
I hope you don't mind

I brought Wayne along.

</line>


<line>
- Who's Wayne?

- I'm Wayne.

</line>


<line>
I just wanted to make sure

he had everything he needs

for the big <ital>BuzzFeed</ital>

cover story.

</line>


<line>
<ital>BuzzFeed</ital> is a website.

There is no cover.

</line>


<line>
Eh, "tomato," "tomato."

</line>


<line>
It's "tomato," "to-mah-to."

</line>


<line>
You say, "tomato,"

"to-mah-to,"

</line>


<line>
I say, "tomato," "tomato."

</line>


<line>
[shudders]

</line>


<line>
Oh, hey, Diane,

I got you something.

</line>


<line>
Oh, plane tickets?

</line>


<line>
Yep, to San Francisco.

</line>


<line>
That's where the Arbus exhibit

is heading next.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
[crash]

</line>


<line>
[moose call]

</line>


<line>
Gentlemen, dazzle me.

</line>


<line>
What you're about to see

is rough, very rough.

</line>


<line>
It's a vomit pass at what

might become a rock opera.

</line>


<line>
Right now, it's set

mostly in space,

but we're not married

to that.

</line>


<line>
Todd is neither a singer

nor a trained musician.

</line>


<line>
In fact, he never even

graduated high school,

he told me in confidence.

</line>


<line>
Keep all that in mind

as you give it up for Todd.

</line>


<line>
[cheers and applause]

</line>


<line>
Okay, so we start in 1887

with a young Emma Goldman.

</line>

<ital><music>♪ Sla-a-a-a-a-aves ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
It needs

a third act showstopper.

</line>


<line>
I had the same note.

</line>


<line>
But in all,

it's spellbinding.

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] All right!

</line>


<line>
Whoo!

[applause]

</line>


<line>
You know, I run a small

theater in North Hollywood.

</line>


<line>
We were supposed to mount

a <ital>J.C. Superstar </ital>revival

next month, but of course,

Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be

a real hot penis

about everything.

</line>


<line>
Oh, Andy.

Fool me once, shame on you,

but teach a man to fool me,

and I'll be fooled

for the rest of my life.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, could this show

be ready to debut in six weeks?

</line>


<line>
Six weeks? Uh, damn.

Yeah, I guess so.

</line>


<line>
Marvelous! We'll schedule

an investor showcase posthaste.

</line>


<line>
In the meantime, libations!

</line>


<line>
Ah!

[laughter]

</line>


<line>
- Popping, what?

- This is great.

</line>


<line>
You know, just when you think

you have a person pegged,

he can still find ways

to surprise you.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, Todd really rose

to the occasion, didn't he?

</line>


<line>
I was talking about you.

</line>


<line>
Ah, well,

it was nothing.

</line>


<line>
Maybe the Zoe has

a little Zelda in him after all.

</line>


<line>
I appreciate the sentiment,

but I still think

that game is stupid.

</line>


<line>
Hey, BoJack, do you realize

what this means?

</line>


<line>
I mean, if this thing's a hit,

I could finally move out.

</line>


<line>
Oh, uh,

you're gonna move out?

</line>


<line>
You won't have to yell,

"Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"

</line>


<line>
Or, "Todd, why haven't you

cleaned up your shit yet?"

</line>


<line>
Or, "Todd, what was the name of

that guy from <ital>Perfect Strangers?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Not Bronson Pinchot,

but the other one?"

</line>


<line>
Good, that's great.

That's great and good.

</line>


<line>
So good, so great.

</line>


<line>
- Just great, and also good.

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>

</line>


<line>
And as you can see,

progress has been swift.

</line>


<line>
For tomorrow's

investor showcase,

we'll have choreography

and pyrotechnics for you.

</line>


<line>
This is all just

happening so fast.

</line>


<line>
I don't-- I don't think

Todd is ready for this.

</line>


<line>
Todd's not ready

or you're not ready?

</line>


<line>
Don't make this about me.

I've seen what happens

when baby birds get pushed

out of the nest too soon.

</line>


<line>
It's not your fault.

</line>


<line>
I thought he was ready.

He seemed ready.

</line>


<line>
It's not... your... fault.

</line>


<line>
You're right.

In these heady times,

what Todd needs is an agent.

Ha! Ha!

</line>


<line>
- I just need you to deliver...

- Hoo! Ha!

</line>


<line>
- That third act showstopper...

- Ha!

</line>


<line>
...and then we'll be

fully financed!

</line>


<line>
Todd can do it!

Todd can do anything!

</line>


<line>
- Can I get your autograph?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

</line>


<line>
And another autograph,

and initial here, here,

here, and here.

</line>


<line>
- Right here?

- And the last four digits

</line>


<line>
- of your social.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
So I think the big

third act number Virgil wants

might be a big anthem that--

</line>


<line>
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

buddy, buddy,

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna let you start

on this until we stock up

on snacks and Red Bull.

</line>


<line>
I do get snacky.

You think of everything.

</line>


<line>
'Scuse me, young man.

</line>


<line>
Can you hand me

that Ronnie Milsap cassingle

in the 10-cent bin?

</line>


<line>
Sure thing, lady.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

Decapathon VII?

</line>


<line>
This just came out.

</line>


<line>
Todd, put it down.

</line>


<line>
Is this really

only a dime?

</line>


<line>
If it's in there,

that's the price.

</line>


<line>
Todd, this is no time

for a relapse.

</line>


<line>
Look, okay, I'll buy it now,

but I won't play it

till after I've written

the new song.

</line>


<line>
Todd, this is a bad idea!

</line>


<line>
- Whoa!

- All sales are final.

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's see here.

</line>


<line>
I wonder if it still

smells the same.

</line>


<line>
I assure you,

it still smells

like cheap plastic

and child labor.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

Okay, here we go. Song time.

</line>


<line>
[plays a single scale]

</line>


<line>
Or should I just play

one game now,

just to get

the creative juices flowing?

</line>


<line>
We both know that if you

play that game tonight,

you'll never leave

this couch!

</line>


<line>
Ah, no, you're right,

of course.

</line>


<line>
- Thank you.

- Good night.

</line>


<line>
[three single piano notes]

</line>


<line>
[heavy metal music]

</line>


<line>
Come on, Decapathon, come on.

</line>


<line>
[mumbling]

Oh, come on, Decapathon.

</line>


<line>
Oh. [grunts]

</line>


<line>
Wake up!

It's the morning!

</line>


<line>
Damn it, Todd, the investor

showcase is in half an hour.

</line>


<line>
- Did you work on the song?

- Huh?

</line>


<line>
Pull yourself together, man!

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Why did the water

have to come out of your mouth?

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm awfully sorry

to have wasted your time.

</line>


<line>
I don't think our man

is going to show.

</line>


<line>
[door slams open]

</line>


<line>
Wait!

</line>


<line>
- Good God, what's happened?

- [groaning]

</line>


<line>
He looks like he was

up all night

playing some sort of

videographic game.

</line>


<line>
He's in no condition

to debut a song.

</line>


<line>
Give the kid a chance,

Van Cleef.

<ital><music>♪ Loam ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
Enough!

</line>


<line>
Clearly,

Van Cleef has shown

a rare lapse in taste

and judgment.

</line>


<line>
I apologize for wasting your

time with this talentless imp.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Van Cleef,

Todd may not be ready

for the high-flying world

of rock opera

or the larger world

outside of my living room couch,

but you know what?

He's a good friend.

</line>


<line>
I don't see

how that's relevant.

</line>


<line>
No, of course you don't.

Maybe Todd's worse off today,

but you're worse off

in the long run,

because you're gonna die

alone and unloved,

you pompous,

affected asshole!

</line>


<line>
[grunts] <ital>Mon dieu!</ital>

Never have I ever!

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe don't

burn the bridge.

</line>


<line>
I could still beg

for a second chance.

</line>


<line>
Shut your mouth, Todd.

</line>


<line>
And you shut yours, Van Cleef,

or I will buck it shut.

</line>


<line>
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[blows raspberry]

</line>


<line>
Oh, that damn video game.

</line>


<line>
No, it's not

the video game's fault.

</line>


<line>
I blew it.

</line>


<line>
For a second,

I actually convinced myself

</line>


<line>
I was more than

just a worthless screw-up.

</line>


<line>
Fool me once, fool me twice,

fool me chicken soup with rice.

</line>


<line>
I guess there's a reason

they don't call it

</line>


<line>
"the rock opera fun."

</line>


<line>
They call it

"the rock opera business."

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

Guess I won't be needing

this piece of junk anymore.

</line>


<line>
Hey, no.

Hold on to that.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you just put it

in the living room closet?

</line>


<line>
- Really?

- In fact, from now on,

you can keep all your stuff

in the living room closet.

</line>


<line>
Thanks, BoJack,

for everything.

</line>


<line>
This, I will get rid of.

</line>


<line>
- What the--

- Don't look at those!

</line>


<line>
- Those are private!

- Are these the notes

you've been taking

on Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
It's gibberish!

</line>


<line>
Have you just been mashing keys

this whole time?

</line>


<line>
It's a-- it's a work

in progress.

</line>


<line>
What's really going on here?

</line>


<line>
Look, I've been following

you two around

for the last couple weeks,

and I think it's pretty obvious

to everyone that you shouldn't

be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
You should be with me.

</line>


<line>
No, I've dated you.

</line>


<line>
Sure, you're smart

and sophisticated and cool,

but you're also mean.

</line>


<line>
What's your article

on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

</line>


<line>
The working title is,

"Nine Jokes From the '90s

</line>


<line>
We Haven't Stopped

Laughing at."

</line>


<line>
- I knew it!

- Come on!

</line>


<line>
Like you're not gonna

tear BoJack apart in your book.

</line>


<line>
I'm not "tearing him apart."

</line>


<line>
I'm writing a nuanced portrait

of a complicated man.

</line>


<line>
Well, then, we might be

doing different things.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter

is nice to me!

</line>


<line>
He's kind and he's generous

and he's loyal.

</line>


<line>
You know what your problem is?

You're trying to be a Zelda

but you're so obviously a Zoe.

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Don't label me.

You don't know who I am.

</line>


<line>
You can live your happy Zelda

life in this happy Zelda town

and pretend you're

a happy Zelda,

but I know you,

and this isn't you.

</line>


<line>

<ital>not really.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I bought this earlier,

and I'd like to return it.

</line>


<line>
I don't know where

the receipt went.

</line>


<line>
I remember you.

You came in yesterday.

<line>
No problem.

This never happened.
