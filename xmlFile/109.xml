</line>


<line>
So... should we talk about

how you just tried to kiss me?

</line>


<line>
No, I don't think

we need to talk about that.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you're right.

What's to talk about, right?

</line>


<line>
We're f-friends, right?

</line>


<line>
- Oh, yeah, totally.

- Yeah, friends.

</line>


<line>
And I think it's important

that we stay friends.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I agree.

</line>


<line>
And be friends

with each other.

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, friends.

- And also to each other.

</line>


<line>
Plus, hey,

you're getting married.

</line>


<line>
That's right.

Next summer.

</line>


<line>
Nantucket is great

in the summer.

</line>


<line>
Not like L.A.,

which is so hot and dry.

</line>


<line>
- [laughs]

- It is arid.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[brakes squeak]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Well... see you later!

</line>


<line>
We're still a few miles--

</line>


<line>
I'll walk.

It's a beautiful night.

</line>


<line>
- [horn honks, tires screech]

- Ah! Sorry, sorry!

</line>


<line>
Shit.

</line>


<line>
Todd, we gotta stop

this wedding.

</line>


<line>
Todd?

</line>


<line>
Aw, crap.

I left him in Malibu.

</line>

</line>


<line>
But wait, doesn't Diane want

to marry Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
No, see, she thinks she does,

but she actually doesn't.

</line>


<line>
That's why we need to be

good friends right now,

</line>


<line>
and put our own feelings aside

</line>


<line>
and sabotage

our friend's engagement.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
- Wait? What?

- Oh.

</line>


<line>
I got here as soon as I could.

What's the emergency?

</line>


<line>
We got to figure out a way

to stop Diane's wedding.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clears throat]</nonVerbComm>

Okay.

</line>


<line>
So when you woke me up

in the middle of the night

</line>


<line>
and told me to rush over here

because of an "emergency,"

</line>


<line>
the emergency

you were referring to

</line>


<line>
was Diane getting married

a year from now?

</line>


<line>
- Yeah, you got any ideas?

- I'm done.

</line>


<line>
I'm not going to waste

another thought on you.

</line>


<line>
I am at a bar.

It's the weekend.

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

</line>


<line>
Look, if you don't have

any ideas,

</line>


<line>
just say you don't have

any ideas.

</line>


<line>
Yoo-hoo!

Buy me a drink.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
What's your name, stud?

</line>


<line>
Vincent.

</line>


<line>
Adult... man.

</line>


<line>
Vincent Adultman.

</line>


<line>
Ya hear that, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
Vincent is an adult,

and I'll bet he knows

how to treat a lady.

</line>


<line>
He very clearly

isn't and doesn't.

</line>


<line>
Would you like alcohol?

</line>


<line>
I certainly would,

</line>


<line>
you sophisticated

smooth talker.

</line>


<line>
Mmm!

Tell me all about you<ital>.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Mm...

</line>


<line>
I like business...

transactions.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Are you seriously trying

to make me jealous

by flirting with

what is very obviously

just three kids

stacked on top

</line>


<line>
of each other

under a trench coat?

</line>


<line>
Vinnie, what does a guy

like you do for fun?

</line>


<line>
I don't have time

for these shenanigans.

</line>


<line>
I got a wedding

to shanghai.

</line>


<line>
Good luck with

your business transactions.

</line>


<line>
- Thanks.

- [grunts] Ugh!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Officer.

</line>


<line>
The mail truck pulled up

right next to me.

</line>


<line>
I got a bad vibe.

What was I supposed to do?

</line>


<line>
Not chase the mail truck?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I'm a big fan,

so I'm gonna let you off

with a warning this time.

Hey, honeysuckle.

Great news.

</line>


<line>
I got to ride

in a police car.

</line>


<line>
Bad news--

I lost my driver's license.

</line>


<line>
Let me guess.

</line>


<line>
Were you chasing

the mailman again?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, why?

Did you see him out there too?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[lowers voice]</nonVerbComm>

Nothing stops them.

</line>


<line>
Not rain, not sleet,

not dead of night,

not gates!

[dramatic music]

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

I need a little favor.

</line>


<line>
Can you... drive me

everywhere I need to go

for the next three months?

</line>


<line>
I really can't, sweetheart.

I'm super busy.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you're working

on our wedding registry.

</line>


<line>
- I'm writing my book.

- Right.

</line>


<line>
But don't forget

about the registry.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

you know I love you.

</line>


<line>
And you know I am really excited

about getting married,

but right now I'm working,

and I have a lot of thoughts

in my head,

and I can't really think

about our wedding

or the future

or me being married to you.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

What's going on?

</line>


<line>
Talk to me like

I'm Michelle Pfeiffer

in the Coolio video.

</line>


<line>
Just-- Well, um...

with the leg--

</line>


<line>
Hmm, all right.

</line>


<line>
And Coolio.

</line>


<line>
Nothing's going on.

</line>


<line>
It's just that this wedding

is kind of

starting to feel like

a lot.

</line>


<line>
Honey, relax.

Getting married is easy.

</line>


<line>
I mean,

I've already done it twice.

</line>


<line>
It's fine.

I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
I just... need to focus

on the book right now.

</line>


<line>
So that's still a no

on driving me around?

</line>


<line>
- Why don't you hire a driver?

- Eh-eh-eh-deh--

</line>


<line>
Is there a light bulb

above my head?

</line>


<line>
Because while you were talking,

I just got an amazing idea.

</line>


<line>
I should hire a driver!

</line>


<line>
Oh, this will be a romp.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> If I know me,

this will be a romp.

</line>


<line>
I'm not sure how I feel

about breaking and entering,

BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's the beauty part.

</line>


<line>
The B&amp;E is really

the least illegal piece

of this 12-point master plan.

</line>


<line>
- Have you got your tool kit?

- Check.

</line>


<line>
- Burner phone?

- Check.

</line>


<line>
- Cyanide capsule?

- Check.

</line>


<line>
Wait, why do we need--

</line>


<line>
Okay, let's get started.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Step one: Enter the study.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[glass shatters]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Step two: Plant incriminating--</ital>

</line>


<line>
- Hello? Todd?

- Uh...

</line>


<line>
- Hi, Mr. Peanutbutter.

<ital>- Take the cyanide, Todd.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Take the cyanide!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[panting]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
And hup. Hup.

</line>


<line>
And hup-- No.

</line>


<line>
Are you here to interview

to be my driver?

</line>


<line>
Um... yes, I am.

</line>


<line>
Brilliant.

</line>


<line>
I didn't even post

the ad yet.

</line>


<line>
Here's me thinking

destiny over here.

</line>


<line>
And hup. Yeah!

</line>


<line>
Hu-aah!

[crash]

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[car alarm blares]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[car alarm chirps]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Thank you for your interest

in the role of driver.

</line>


<line>
I know you don't have

your resume with you,

so I've taken the liberty

of letting you use mine.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, thanks.

</line>


<line>
Here, business boss.

</line>


<line>
Let's just have a look here.

Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
Oh, ho,

with a resume like this,

you should be the one

hiring a driver.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Just kidding.

</line>


<line>
I know it's my resume.

</line>


<line>
But I see you went

to Northwestern.

</line>


<line>
You know,

I'm an N.U. man myself.

</line>


<line>
Go, fighting Westerns.

</line>


<line>
And it says here you do

a great Rodney Dangerfield

impression.

</line>


<line>
Give us a taste.

</line>


<line>
Uh, okay.

</line>


<line>
"I'm Roger Dangerfield."

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

No respect, indeed.

</line>


<line>
Todd, you got the job.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Can you believe this weather

we're having?

</line>


<line>
No, I cannot believe

this weather we're having!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, wow.

We make a great pair.

</line>


<line>
It's like I'm Miss Daisy,

and you're Minnie Driver.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[lawn mower rattling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
- [phone beeps]

- Hey, I'm bored.

</line>


<line>
And I think Todd swallowed

a cyanide pill

and might be dead.

</line>


<line>
Wanna come over

and bang it out?

</line>


<line>
Appealing as that sounds,

</line>


<line>
I have lunch plans

with Vincent.

</line>


<line>
I know that might be hard

for you to hear.

</line>


<line>
Wait, that guy from the bar

who is actually three boys

stacked on top of each other

under a trench coat?

</line>


<line>
Well, don't fly into

a jealous rage about it.

</line>


<line>
Not jealous.

</line>


<line>
Just reminding you that

you are trying

to have a relationship

with someone who is--

and again, it's bizarre

</line>


<line>
I should have to point

this out-- three young boys

</line>


<line>
<ital>stacked on top of each other</ital>

<ital>under a trench coat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
He listens to me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, but can

you just acknowledge that--

</line>


<line>
- That you are being jealous?

- Oh, oh!

</line>


<line>
- [glass shatters]

- Already acknowledged.

</line>


<line>
- Toodles.

- [phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
- Look who's not dead.

- Better than not dead.

</line>


<line>
You are looking at

Mr. Peanutbutter's new driver.

</line>


<line>
You're his driver?

That's perfect.

</line>


<line>
Now you can infiltrate

Mr. Peanutbutter's inner circle.

</line>


<line>
I don't know, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Sure, you'll act

all friendly,

gain his trust,

chauffer him around

on his little errands

to the groomer and whatnot,

but all the while,

you'll be studying him,

scouring out his weaknesses,

biding your time

till we're ready to strike.

</line>


<line>
And once you zero in

on his Achilles' heel,

we will take... him... down.

</line>


<line>
Hooray. Betrayal.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[warbling]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Oh, man. Oh, man.

</line>


<line>
- Keep it cool, Todd.

- Hey, pal.

</line>


<line>
If you're making

small talk up there,

how about sending

a little my way?

</line>


<line>
Um... can you believe

this weather we're having?

</line>


<line>
No, I cannot believe

this weather we're having!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[doorbell rings, horse neighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, weren't you supposed

to be here

like a half hour ago?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I've just been

sitting in my car.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[chuckles]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Listen, I was looking

over my notes,

and I think I have enough

to go write the book,

so...

I'm just going to do that.

</line>


<line>
You don't want

to interview me anymore?

</line>


<line>
But don't you want to know

what my Rosebud is?

</line>


<line>
You told me repeatedly

it was the nudie magazine

your uncle showed you

with the three-nippled woman.

</line>


<line>
- Who was she?

- I got it all.

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'll see you

around though, right?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

I, um--

</line>


<line>
Why did you have to make

things weird, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[car door opens, closes]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I made things weird?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Mr. Peanutbutter]</nonVerbComm><ital> </ital>So if you see anything

you know we need,

like this biscuit warmer,

you just run the laser

over the barcode,

</line>


<line>
- and kablamsky!

- [beep]

</line>


<line>
It goes in the registry.

</line>


<line>
And that way, everybody knows

what I want.

</line>


<line>
- And I know what I want.

- Uh...

</line>


<line>
Which is what everyone wants.

</line>


<line>
And it's really clear,

and nobody's confused

about anything.

</line>


<line>
Am I crazy,

or are you not into this?

</line>


<line>
No, I am. It's just--

[sighs]

</line>


<line>
The big wedding in Nantucket,

all these presents--

</line>


<line>
I'm so overwhelmed,

I can barely consider

whether I want or need

a biscuit warmer,

which I think is how people

end up with biscuit warmers.

</line>


<line>
Hey.

Hey, hey, hey.

</line>


<line>
Close your eyes.

Come on.

</line>


<line>
Okay, picture

our lives together.

</line>


<line>
It's a cold Sunday morning

a bunch of years from now.

</line>


<line>
Maybe robots have taken over,

maybe they haven't.

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

It's the future.

</line>


<line>
This story isn't about that.

</line>


<line>
The important thing is

it's Sunday morning.

</line>


<line>
I brought you the paper,

fetched your slippers.

</line>


<line>
You come into the kitchen--

Can you smell biscuits?

</line>


<line>
- Yes.

- So can I.

</line>


<line>
- Are they warm?

- Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's all

a biscuit warmer's for.

</line>


<line>
Look, if marriage

stresses you out,

we don't have to get married.

</line>


<line>
It's not the marriage.

</line>


<line>
It's the wedding

and the year of build-up.

</line>


<line>
So forget all that.

</line>


<line>
I've done

the whole big wedding thing.

</line>


<line>
I don't need to do it again.

</line>


<line>
Let's do something

small and casual

right here in town

next month.

</line>


<line>
Honestly,

that would be amazing.

</line>


<line>
But we'd have to cancel

the doves,

and we wouldn't be able

to send out

those fancy invitations

you liked.

</line>


<line>
Those doves were being

jerks anyway.

</line>


<line>
And invitations--

They're just a scam

made up by the Post Office

to keep tabs on us.

</line>


<line>
Post Office.

</line>


<line>
- [growls]

- Settle down, boy.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Todd]</nonVerbComm> And then we talked about

his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[crunching]</nonVerbComm>

And-- Oh, oh.

</line>


<line>
And then that led to a whole

conversations about sticks.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and let me tell you,

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some

serious opinions about sticks.

</line>


<line>
Why are you telling me this?

</line>


<line>
What? You said

you wanted every detail.

</line>


<line>
Did I mention

he got a new bandana?

</line>


<line>
Give me something

I can use

to make them call off

their wedding.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

Did I not tell you?

</line>


<line>
They called off their wedding.

</line>


<line>
What? Thank God!

</line>


<line>
Oh, the universe makes sense.

</line>


<line>
They decided against

a big destination wedding,

so they're doing it here

</line>


<line>
- sometime next month.

- What?

</line>


<line>
I guess saying

they called it off

is probably not right.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[ominous music]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Hey, what's this?

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes,

I got jury duty,

but I can't worry

about that right now.

</line>


<line>
That is a problem for

Friday BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Now think, Todd.

Gotta have something I can use

sloshing around in that

pot-infused Jell-O shot

</line>


<line>
- you call a brain.

- Let's see.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter likes having

his tummy scratched,

and Diane's family

is from Vietnam,

which is where Vietnamese food

comes from,

and since that goes

in your tummy--

</line>


<line>
Okay, stop thinking.

Just give me raw data.

</line>


<line>
What's happening this week?

</line>


<line>
Well, the circus

is in town.

</line>


<line>
Congress is going to vote

on the new Education Bill--

</line>


<line>
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

</line>


<line>
What's happening

with Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm taking

Diane and him

to the bank on Thursday.

</line>


<line>
I can use that.

I can actually use that.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I'm up

for staging

a bank robbery, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Oh, come on, character

actress Margo Martindale.

</line>


<line>
They say that there are

no good parts

for women over 50.

</line>


<line>
I want to stick an AK-47

in your hand

and prove them wrong.

</line>


<line>
I do tire of the limitations

of stage, film,

and television.

</line>


<line>
You might as well perform

in a cage, am I right?

</line>


<line>
This is guerilla theater--

</line>


<line>
No stage, no script, no net.

</line>


<line>
It's the kind of work

we talked about

doing that night

in the desert.

</line>


<line>
Don't tell me we left

those dreams in the sweat lodge.

</line>


<line>
- Hell, I'll do it.

- [dishes clatter]

</line>


<line>
And that little boy

never found his mother.

</line>


<line>
Hey, guys.

</line>


<line>
BoJack Horseman?

</line>


<line>
Oh. Hi.

</line>


<line>
What a weird coincidence.

</line>


<line>
I did not know

you would be here today.

</line>


<line>
How are... things?

</line>


<line>
Things are good.

You?

</line>


<line>
Things good with you?

</line>


<line>
Hands behind your head,

everybody.

</line>


<line>
Nobody moves,

nobody gets shot.

</line>


<line>
- [gasps]

- What an unfortunate surprise.

</line>


<line>
Well, well,

isn't that a pretty ring?

</line>


<line>
- [gasps]

- [coughs] This one.

</line>


<line>
Well, well,

isn't that a pretty ring?

</line>


<line>
I'll take it.

</line>


<line>
But it's

my engagement ring.

</line>


<line>
Give it to her, Diane.

</line>


<line>
- It's just a ring.

- Just a ring?

</line>


<line>
That ring is a symbol

of your love.

</line>


<line>
If you don't care

about the ring,

it really makes me wonder

if you care about

the woman wearing it.

</line>


<line>
That terrifying bank robber

is making

some very cogent points.

</line>


<line>
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

</line>


<line>
If the ring is

just a symbol for love,

why would I need a symbol

when I have the real thing

right here?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, we don't need rings,

we have each other.

</line>


<line>
Hey, why are we even waiting

a month to get married?

</line>


<line>
If anything, this bank robbery

is reminding me

that life is short.

</line>


<line>
We should get married

even sooner!

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[softly]</nonVerbComm>

No...

</line>


<line>
What do you mean sooner?

</line>


<line>
Why not this weekend?

</line>


<line>
We could get married Saturday.

</line>


<line>
Am I crazy?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[softly]</nonVerbComm>

Yes. Don't do it.

</line>


<line>
- Oh, keep the damn thing.

- Aw.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[applause]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Okay.

Saturday it is.

</line>


<line>
What the hell

just happened?

</line>


<line>
Something truly beauti--

</line>


<line>
Aah!

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- Get your hands off me!

</line>


<line>
- [Taser crackles]

- Uh-oh.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[landing blows]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm>

Long story short,

</line>


<line>
Erica did have to lose

the foot,

but she gained a friend.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, kind of went off

on a tangent there.

</line>


<line>
Diane and I

wanna thank you all

for coming to our

impromptu rehearsal dinner,

even though

we did not actually have time

</line>


<line>
- to organize a rehearsal.

- Or a dinner.

</line>


<line>
But there is an open bar...

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[cheers and applause]</nonVerbComm>

which you are

all welcome to partake in

as soon as I finish

this toast,

which I will be doing right...

after one more quick anecdote.

</line>


<line>
- [guests groan]

- It was winter in Prague,

and the consumption hung low

in the air.

</line>


<line>
Well, the bank thing

was a dud.

</line>


<line>
Thanks a lot, Todd.

</line>


<line>
Well, you win some,

you lose some.

</line>


<line>
It's like Vincent always says--

</line>


<line>
- "Oopsy."

- Vincent?

</line>


<line>
Yeah,

Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
We've hung out

a couple times.

</line>


<line>
- What are you ta--

- That dude is funny.

</line>


<line>
You know he's not

a person, right?

</line>


<line>
Look, I don't want to get

in the middle

of your whole thing

with Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
It's not about that.

</line>


<line>
I just don't understand

why nobody else

seems to notice

that she is dating a man

who is clearly

three little boys

doing the thing

from <ital>The Little Rascals.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh, that reminds me

of another funny story.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[clinks glass]</nonVerbComm>

If I could say a few words?

</line>


<line>
BoJack Horseman.

Take the mic.

</line>


<line>
Spin us a yarn.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

</line>


<line>
Since I am friends

with both of you

</line>


<line>
- and have no ulterior motives...

- Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
I would like to offer

my restaurant

as a venue for your wedding.

</line>


<line>
Wow! Really?

</line>


<line>
I don't know.

That's too generous.

</line>


<line>
Hey, don't look a horse's gift

in the mouth, right?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughter]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I get it.

Like the song.

</line>


<line>
That's not a song.

</line>


<line>
All right, everyone.

</line>


<line>
That's it for the toasts.

</line>


<line>
Enjoy yourselves

and each other.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[dance music plays]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
This is perfect.

</line>


<line>
Now that the wedding's

at my restaurant,

we have

the home field advantage.

</line>


<line>
Perfect for sabotage.

</line>


<line>
BoJack,

I need to thank you.

</line>


<line>
You calling me to the bar

the other night

turned out to be

the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>


<line>
- I think I'm in love.

- Okay.

</line>


<line>
This "person"

you're in love with--

</line>


<line>
Have you seen him

without his trench coat on?

</line>


<line>
I don't understand why

you can't be happy for me.

</line>


<line>
He's a good boyfriend.

</line>


<line>
I actually think

you and Vincent

would really hit it off

if you gave him a chance.

</line>


<line>
You should spend some

one-on-one time with him.

</line>


<line>
You mean one-on-three time?

</line>


<line>
Because

there are three of him.

</line>


<line>
We get it.

You don't like him.

</line>


<line>
I'm actually not sure

you do get it.

</line>


<line>
- [unzips]

- I know what's been going on.

</line>


<line>
Ah!

I wasn't gonna pee.

</line>


<line>
I was just taking

my penis out.

</line>


<line>
You've been driving me around,

but there was something else

happening the whole time.

</line>


<line>
I see it now.

</line>


<line>
What are you

talking about?

</line>


<line>
You weren't just working

as my driver, Todd.

</line>


<line>
You were becoming my friend.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah.

That was happening.

</line>


<line>
Well, I could use a friend

right about now.

</line>


<line>
There's something I really

gotta get off my chest,

and if it got out, it could

destroy the whole wedding.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm not great

with sensitive information.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I'm ready

to get married again.

</line>


<line>
Don't get me wrong.

I love Diane so much.

</line>


<line>
I didn't have any doubts

until I realized

she had doubts.

</line>


<line>
Then I figured

she's smarter than I am.

</line>


<line>
Maybe she knows things

I don't.

</line>


<line>
You are kind of unloading

a lot of sensitive information here.

</line>


<line>
Sure, I think I'm ready

to commit to Diane,

but I can't even commit

to my favorite type of stick.

</line>


<line>
Yes, today, it's short

and knobby, but tomorrow?

</line>


<line>
Well, sure, Diane is short,

but I don't know about knobby.

</line>


<line>
The last thing I want to do

is hurt Diane,

but I keep having this dream

where she's gone.

</line>


<line>
There's no break-up,

no tragedy.

</line>


<line>
She's just gone, and my life

continues without her.

</line>


<line>
And it terrifies me

to say this,

but in the dream I feel...

relief.

</line>


<line>
Hey, thanks for listening

to all this.

</line>


<line>
You're

a really good friend, Todd.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
Since you weren't able

to give me any useful intel,

</line>


<line>
I had to offer up

my restaurant,

but now, we're on my turf.

</line>


<line>
Time for operation "I don't."

</line>


<line>
Yeah, sounds good.

</line>


<line>
You know, with my knack

for coming up with plans

and your ability

to hear them

without contributing

more than three words

at a time,

we make a pretty good team,

don't we, Todd?

</line>


<line>
- You said it.

- See?

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[news theme playing]</nonVerbComm>

<line>
<nonVerbComm>[newsman]</nonVerbComm> <ital>Beloved character actress</ital>

<ital>Margo Martindale</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is in police custody tonight</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>for her role in</ital>

<ital>a failed bank robbery.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Margo Martindale?

</line>


<line>
<ital>But first,</ital>

<ital>pizza for breakfast?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>The answer might surprise you.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I know her, but how?

Wait.

</line>


<line>
She was

at the convenience store

the night I bought

that video game

and ruined my rock opera.

</line>


<line>
<ital>She's the one who asked me</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>to hand her that tape</ital>

<ital>from the 10¢ bin.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[gasps]</nonVerbComm> That means

Margo Martindale likes tapes!

</line>


<line>
And a tape is something

you listen to,

but tape is also

a sticky thing

you can use to seal boxes.

</line>


<line>
Boxes is

what cereal comes in.

</line>


<line>
What does it all mean?

</line>


<line>
Am I just grasping

at straws?

</line>


<line>
Wait.

Straws-- That's it.

</line>


<line>
Straws are used

to drink soda or water,

and plants need water.

</line>


<line>
And BoJack used Margo Martindale

as a plant

at the bank

and the convenience store,

which means--

Ugh!

</line>


<line>
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

to make me find

that video game

so he could kill

my rock opera!

</line>


<line>
Aw, dude.

</line>


<line>
- Rise and shine, Todd.

- I didn't sleep.

</line>


<line>
Well, we're down to the wire,

but we still got

one more day to figure out

how to stop this wedding,

and I can't afford to waste

one second, so let's get--

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit.

Forgot about jury duty.

</line>


<line>
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

</line>


<line>
- And so, you saw the defendant.

- Yes.

</line>


<line>
That man, the defendant--

You saw him?

</line>


<line>
Come on, come on, come on.

Hurry up.

</line>


<line>
- That's correct.

- The defendant was seen by you.

</line>


<line>
Sweet Jesus.

</line>


<line>
Some of us have weddings

to ruin.

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
No further questions,

Your Honor.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

</line>


<line>
A lot of further questions.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[groans]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
The jury finds the defendant

not guilty on all charges.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[murmuring]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
We did the right thing today,

BoJack.

</line>


<line>
But you know who

the real winner is?

</line>


<line>
- Justice.

- Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[sighs]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
<ital>BoJack.</ital>

</line>


<line>
There's my superstar.

</line>


<line>
- How are you?

- Amazing!

</line>


<line>
This has been

the role of a lifetime.

</line>


<line>
I think they're gonna

send me up to Lompoc,

and when I get there,

I'm gonna find

the meanest, hardest queen bitch

of the yard,

and I'm going to bite

her finger off.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[laughs]</nonVerbComm> That'll show everyone

I'm crazy,

and you don't mess

with crazy.

</line>


<line>
Plus, free finger.

</line>


<line>
Oh, here I am blabbering

on about my plans.

</line>


<line>
Did you ever stop

that wedding?

</line>


<line>
It's actually happening

right now.

</line>


<line>
I ran out of time.

</line>


<line>
I never understood why

it was so important to keep

those two apart.

</line>


<line>
I was just trying to be

a good friend

in my own

shitty, ass-backwards way.

</line>


<line>
Diane deserves the best.

</line>


<line>
She's smart

and kind and beautiful,

and it's gonna be

mostly synonyms from here on

if I keep going,

and I'm in love with her.

</line>


<line>
Tell her that, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
You don't need kooky schemes

or nutty capers.

</line>


<line>
Just go to her

and speak from your heart.

</line>


<line>
Then find the biggest person

at the wedding

and bite his finger off!

</line>


<line>
You're right, partly.

</line>


<line>
I've gotta tell her

how I feel.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

</line>


<line>
Good luck with

your finger thing.

</line>

Todd, thank God you're here!

</line>


<line>
Did I miss it?

Is it too late?

</line>


<line>
Dude. I'm done with this.

No. No.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter's

been nice to me.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter

is nice to everybody.

</line>


<line>
That's what makes him

so stupid.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm stupid.

</line>


<line>
But even I know

that the only reason

you're doing this is because

you're in love with Diane.

</line>


<line>
Yes, that's right.

</line>


<line>
And I'm here to finally

tell her how I feel.

</line>


<line>
BoJack,

she knows how you feel.

</line>


<line>
How?

I barely just realized--

</line>


<line>
Hey, man,

she made her choice.

</line>


<line>
Look around.

This day is not about you, okay?

</line>


<line>
So maybe you should

just stop trying

to mess

with other people's lives.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[Diane]</nonVerbComm><ital> I never thought I wanted</ital>

<ital>to get married.</ital>

</line>


<line>
It's so weird,

this idea of dedicating

yourself to something

for the rest of your life.

</line>


<line>
Like, how could you know,

right?

</line>


<line>
But then I realized it's okay

to not know everything.

</line>


<line>
And some things take

a leap of faith.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want

to take that leap with you.

</line>


<line>
By the power vested in me

by one of those dumb websites,

</line>


<line>
I now pronounce you married.

</line>


<line>
Go ahead.

Kiss, you lovesick dummies.

Hey, Todd. Todd.

</line>


<line>
Thanks for hearing me out

the other night.

</line>


<line>
I'm really glad I went

through with this.

</line>


<line>
This is the happiest day

of my life.

</line>


<line>
Always happy

to be of service.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and, um,

I got you something.

</line>


<line>
Todd Chavez?

</line>


<line>
Hey.

That name's my name.

</line>


<line>
What's "PB Livin'"?

</line>


<line>
My film production company.

Read your title.

</line>


<line>
"Executive Vice President

of West Coast Operations."

</line>


<line>
Whoa! Does that mean

I control the waves?

</line>


<line>
No, it means

you're my assistant.

</line>


<line>
You've got a big future

ahead of you,

and I don't want you

to waste any time looking back.

</line>


<line>
So I got all my cars' mirrors

taken off.

</line>


<line>
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

</line>


<line>
What do I care?

I'm not driving.

</line>


<line>
Hey, BoJack.

Thanks for coming.

</line>


<line>
I wasn't sure

you were gonna make it.

</line>


<line>
Wouldn't have missed it

for the world.

</line>


<line>
You're a good friend.

I'm really glad to know you.

</line>


<line>
- Mwah.

- Sorry that I--

</line>


<line>
If I made things weird.

</line>


<line>
They weren't that weird.

</line>


<line>
- Oh.

- [Mr. Peanutbutter] Diane, honey?

</line>


<line>
Oh, I gotta go

dance with my husband.

</line>


<line>
<nonVerbComm>[squeals]</nonVerbComm>

</line>


<line>
I'm married!

[giggles]

</line>


<line>
Hi.

</line>


<line>
So you're the quote-unquote

person, singular,

that everyone's so crazy about.

</line>


<line>
What have you got figured out

that I don't?

</line>


<line>
Um, adult stuff.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

</line>


<line>
But that doesn't matter.

Not everything's about me.

</line>


<line>
And maybe I am

a little jealous.

</line>


<line>
Not because I actually want to

date Princess Carolyn anymore,

but just because I don't like

the idea that I can't.

</line>


<line>
I guess I just assumed

I always could.

</line>


<line>
But I made

a lot of bad decisions.

</line>


<line>
Not just with her.

With... [sighs]

with everyone, really.

</line>


<line>
You know,

Princess Carolyn was right.

</line>


<line>
- You are a good listener.

- Thanks.

</line>


<line>
You know, sometimes I feel

like I was born with a leak,

and any goodness I started

with just slowly

spilled out of me,

and now it's all gone.

</line>


<line>
And I'll never get it

back in me.

</line>


<line>
It's too late.

</line>


<line>
Life is a series of

closing doors, isn't it?

Don't be sad.
