  <h4>
  


<line>
-We're live in five minutes, folks.

-[crew member] Make way.

</line>


<line>
Someone find out the average rainfall

in Bora Bora.

</line>


<line>
Thank you so much for doing this.

</line>


<line>
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to

being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

</line>


<line>
It's more than being an elbow

they couldn't crop out of

a red-carpet shot in <ital>US Weekly.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-I've been that elbow.

-Hello, what have we here?

</line>


<line>
So you know

how the game's played, right?

</line>


<line>
I'm sure I'll pick it up.

How hard could it be?

</line>


<line>
You didn't read the treatment?

I faxed it to you.

</line>


<line>
My bad, our fax machine

isn't plugged in.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, this is our first show

and it is very important that things

run smoothly tonight.

</line>


<line>
I mean, do you even care

about this at all?

</line>


<line>
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid

and a waste of everybody's time.

</line>


<line>
But you're my girlfriend

and I care about you.

</line>


<line>
-So I'm here.

-Okay. Break a leg.

</line>


<line>
[vocalizing] Me, me, me. My, my, my.

Bow-wow-wow-wow.

</line>


<line>
Good boy, good boy.

</line>


<line>
Okay, this is it, everybody.

Moment of truth.

</line>


<line>
Now it's in the hands of god.

</line>


<line>
And for the next 30 minutes,

I am that God.

</line>


<line>
-I got you an iPad, ma'am.

-Oh, no thanks, Mia.

</line>


<line>
I'm still working my way through

the last 30 years of technology.

</line>


<line>
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

</line>


<line>
But you can use our second screen app

to see what viewers say

about the show as it airs.

</line>


<line>
Oh, cool,

I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you just touch it.

</line>


<line>
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.

Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

</line>


<line>
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in

my class from a prestigious university,

rise through the ranks at

an elite news organization,

win a well-known award,

never ever be sick at sea

and also my name is Mia McKibben,

so that I could deal with your nonsense.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

</line>


<line>
But I like it there.

</line>


<line>
They brush my hair and tell me stories

about their weekends.

</line>


<line>
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,

Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

</line>


<line>
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

and this isn't funny.

No more tomfoolery.

</line>


<line>
When it's me,

we call it "Todd-foolery."

</line>


<line>
We certainly do not call it that.

</line>


<line>
Listen up, everyone.

</line>


<line>
What you are part of tonight

is bigger than you.

</line>


<line>
It's bigger than any of us.

</line>


<line>
I expect all of you to work together.

</line>


<line>
But I also expect that one of you

will tower above the rest.

</line>


<line>
And that outstanding individual

will receive this pen.

</line>


<line>
It was through this pen that I bled

</line>


<line>
<ital>Raise High The Roof Beam,</ital>

<ital>Carpenters </ital>upon the page.

</line>


<line>
Also, it has four different colors.

</line>


<line>
Black, red, blue

and for some reason, green.

</line>


<line>
By the end of tonight,

this pen will be bestowed upon

the person most deserving.

</line>


<line>
Because nothing is more

important than television,

and no one more important than

the people who make that television.

</line>


<line>
-Now, let's get to work.

-[AD] And five, four,

</line>


<line>
-three, two...

-[J.D.] Showtime.

</line>


<line>
[♪♪]

</line>


<line>
-[audience cheering]

-[lively music playing over speakers]

</line>


<line>
[announcer] <ital>Live from the historic</ital>

<ital>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,</ital>

</line>


<line>
J.D. Salinger Presents:

</line>


<line>
Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities,

What Do They Know?

</line>


<line>
Do They Know Things?

Let's Find Out!

</line>


<line>
[howls]

</line>


<line>
Ah. All right! Here we go.

</line>


<line>
Listen to that crowd.

</line>


<line>
If they lose it this much

for Mr. Peanutbutter,

</line>


<line>
can you imagine what they're going to

do for a real celebrity?

</line>


<line>
Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,

so be nice.

</line>


<line>
When you say nice, do you mean kind?

</line>


<line>
Or, like,

delivering a lot of sick burns,

</line>


<line>
so that people in the audience go,

"Nice."

</line>


<line>
The first one. Obviously the first one.

</line>


<line>
Tonight we answer the age-old question:

</line>


<line>
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities,

what do they know?

</line>


<line>
Do they know things?

Let's find out!"

</line>


<line>
-[audience cheering]

-[music resumes]

</line>


<line>
And now our first-ever guest.

</line>


<line>
You know him from his years on

<ital>Horsin' Around,</ital>

</line>


<line>
his drunk appearance on <ital>The View,</ital>

</line>


<line>
and his bestselling book,

it's BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
-[audience cheering]

-[BoJack chuckles]

</line>


<line>
There you are. How are you doing?

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, welcome.

-It is great to be here.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat,

because we've entered

</line>


<line>
-the Small Talk Round.

-The what now?

</line>


<line>
[dramatic music plays over speakers]

</line>


<line>
Thirty seconds on the clock.

BoJack, how are you?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, fine?

-Correct.

</line>


<line>
-Did you see the game last night?

-No, I don't follow--

</line>


<line>
-[Peanutbutter] Oh.

-[buzzer sounds]

</line>


<line>
Oh, so sorry.

It says here you did see the game.

</line>


<line>
[buzzer sounds]

</line>


<line>
<ital>-What game?</ital>

-[J.D.] Ready camera one? Camera one.

</line>


<line>
<ital>You tell me.</ital>

<ital>You're the one who saw it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[audience laughs]

-I don't--

</line>


<line>
-[woman screams] <ital>God, no!</ital>

-[BoJack gasps]

</line>


<line>
-What the--?

-That noise means

</line>


<line>
it's time for your first

General Knowledge question.

</line>


<line>
Audience, does BoJack know things?

</line>


<line>
[audience] Let's find out!

</line>


<line>
BoJack, what is the average

annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, this is general knowledge?

-It's just an average we're asking for.

</line>


<line>
-I don't know, seven?

-Wrong! So wrong.

</line>


<line>
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,

</line>


<line>
maybe this celebrity should

have studied more-a more-a.

</line>


<line>
[J.D.]

Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

</line>


<line>
-That doesn't really seem--

-[woman] <ital>They're all dead!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I watched them die!</ital>

</line>


<line>
-What is--?

-Oh-ho. That sound means

it's time to pick your category.

</line>


<line>
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"

and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

</line>


<line>
At the Movies With

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'

<ital>Star Trek </ital>reboot, did I call it:

</line>


<line>
A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

</line>


<line>
B, "A zestful lark through time

and space,"

</line>


<line>
C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie

of all time,"

</line>


<line>
or D, "All of the above"?

</line>


<line>
-I'll say D?

-Ouch, the answer was A and B.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Though I would</ital>

<ital>also agree with C.</ital>

</line>


<line>
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter

I'd drive him here,

and next thing I know,

I'm an Associate Producer.

</line>


<line>
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

</line>


<line>
Next time I'll just try that

thing where I'm a huge dumbass

who happens to be friends

with Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
-Yup.

-Cool.

</line>


<line>
Well, have fun watching me

win that pen.

</line>


<line>
I don't need a pen.

</line>


<line>
I can walk into any Chili's with a child

under 12 and get crayons for free.

</line>


<line>
You don't get it.

</line>


<line>
If Salinger gives you his pen,

that means you're worth something.

</line>


<line>
It means you're a serious person

who's going places.

</line>


<line>
Actually, you know what?

Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

</line>


<line>
-[buzzer sounds]

-Oh, the answer is Egypt.

</line>


<line>
Turn up the directional heat lamps.

Oh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
Let's really make him sweat.

</line>


<line>
Surprised you didn't get that one,

since you're an expert

when it comes to de-Nile.

</line>


<line>
Quick impression. [drinks]

"I'm not an alcoholic."

</line>


<line>
[laughs] You love it.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt

over here. Am I right?

</line>


<line>
You know, like King Tut?

</line>


<line>
Because we're talking about Egypt?

And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

</line>


<line>
You suck.

</line>


<line>
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-You could get one thing right tonight.

-[audience laughs]

</line>


<line>
Anyway, let's take a moment

to look at the great comments

we've been getting on

our second screen app,

now available for download.

</line>


<line>
And we're out.

Fifteen seconds, everybody.

</line>


<line>
-Hey, how am I doing?

-You're kind of being a dick.

</line>


<line>
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?

</line>


<line>
Because there's a lot

of ribbing going on here.

</line>


<line>
I'm not ribbing you.

I'm telling you, you're--

</line>


<line>
-And we're back in three, two...

-[music plays]

</line>


<line>
Welcome back.

</line>


<line>
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show

history as our worst contestant ever?

</line>


<line>
So far, yes.

</line>


<line>
[audience chuckling]

</line>


<line>
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

</line>


<line>
Wait till they see this.

Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

</line>


<line>
[woman] <ital>Death from above!</ital>

[Bojack gasps]

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time

to drop "da" bomb.

</line>


<line>
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

</line>


<line>
What I'm trying to say is,

it's a positive bomb.

</line>


<line>
Audience, let's...

</line>


<line>
[audience] Drop da bomb!

</line>


<line>
Did you guys all practice

before the show, because--

</line>


<line>
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had

some fun with our little celebrity.

</line>


<line>
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

</line>


<line>
-Big celebrity?

-Say hello to...

</line>


<line>
-Daniel Radcliffe!

-Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe!

-[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
We'll find out what our big celebrity

knows right after this break.

</line>


<line>
[BoJack groans]

</line>


<line>
And we're out.

Oh, we're cooking now.

</line>


<line>
Hey, you, you're doing great.

</line>


<line>
I'm not 100 percent watching

because I'm so engrossed

in the second screen experience,

but according to

the second screen experience,

other people are loving the show.

</line>


<line>
You didn't tell me

there would be another celebrity.

</line>


<line>
Well, I had no idea that was coming

but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420

loved the surprise.

</line>


<line>
He said, "Two dongs way up."

</line>


<line>
There was no mention of another bigger

celebrity in the document you faxed?

</line>


<line>
I couldn't read it. My fax machine

cut it into little strips.

</line>


<line>
-That sounds like a shredder.

-Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

</line>


<line>
-[iPad chimes]

-I gotta deal with this.

</line>


<line>
If I don't interact with this app

every 80 seconds,

it charges my credit card five dollars.

Love you.

</line>


<line>
[mumbling] Ehh... you, too.

</line>


<line>
Could you get the base

a little less pale?

</line>


<line>
-Hey, Daniel, good to see you.

-Always nice to meet a fan.

</line>


<line>
-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.

-Oh, good for you.

</line>


<line>
It's a dreadful business

but hang in there.

</line>


<line>
No, I already did hang in there.

I'm BoJack Horseman?

</line>


<line>
We've actually met before.

</line>


<line>
At Chris Martin's holiday party?

We stepped outside for a smoke?

</line>


<line>
-To get away from Chris Martin?

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
You opened up

about your fear of success?

</line>


<line>
I gave you some advice?

</line>


<line>
You said I was a true friend

and you would never forget me?

</line>


<line>
And you said your name

was Chadwick Boseman?

</line>


<line>
-BoJack Horseman.

-Oh, I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
When you're as famous as I am,

you meet so many people.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

</line>


<line>
You were the second hairdresser's

assistant on <ital>The Ellen Show</ital>

about five years ago.

Veronica, right?

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, that's right.

-How was your mother's party in the end?

</line>


<line>
And we're back in five, four,

three, two...

</line>


<line>
So you never say one, huh?

</line>


<line>
-Welcome back, America.

-[man] We love you, Daniel.

</line>


<line>
[laughs] So do I. So let's watch

our celebrities go... Audience?

</line>


<line>
[all] Head to head!

</line>


<line>
<ital>How could they possibly know that?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-This is the first episode, right?</ital>

-[J.D. laughs]

</line>


<line>
The puppets clap

when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

</line>


<line>
Hello. Serious,

Going-Places Todd at your service.

</line>


<line>
Hey, look at you, all dressed up

for the Dipshit Awards.

</line>


<line>
You know you're not allowed

in Hair and Makeup.

</line>


<line>
-Are you wearing roller skates?

-I'm wearing Heelys.

</line>


<line>
They're shoes with wheels,

for efficiency purposes.

</line>


<line>
-Now I can be serious faster.

-You can also go nowhere faster.

</line>


<line>
Seeing as I am a professional--

</line>


<line>
No!

</line>


<line>
-[buzzer sounds]

-Oh, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Another embarrassingly

wrong answer,

bringing your score down

by 80 points and 12 dollars.

</line>


<line>
Why are we playing

for both points and dollars?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!

-My name is--

</line>


<line>
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

</line>


<line>
"What color comes from

the combination of blue and yellow?"

</line>


<line>
I actually know this one.

</line>


<line>
When I was growing up,

my neighbor was a painter.

</line>


<line>
I remember visiting his flat

and watching him work.

</line>


<line>
Sometimes he would mix together

blue paint with yellow paint

and it made an entirely new color.

</line>


<line>
And that man was Banksy.

And that color was green.

</line>


<line>
-Final answer.

-Correct!

</line>


<line>
You've earned

the chance to go for a spin

in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

</line>


<line>
[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
Oh, splendid.

</line>


<line>
And while Daniel's in the booth,

BoJack, you have an essay question.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-You'll find a blue book on your podium.

</line>


<line>
"To what extent was feudalism

a cause of the French Revolution?"

</line>


<line>
-Wait, are you ser-- Oh!

-And go!

</line>


<line>
While BoJack works,

let's check out the action

</line>


<line>
-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.

-[audience cheers]

</line>


<line>
-Hey, champ.

-What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
I'm trying to write an essay.

</line>


<line>
I came to ask you how you were doing

and then to tell you

you're not doing so well.

</line>


<line>
Why am I getting

the hard questions,

while Boy Wizard over there

just has to know colors

and literally grab cash out of thin air?

</line>


<line>
[Daniel laughs] A five! This is so easy!

</line>


<line>
I think I might be able to help you out.

Let me tell you a story.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The year was 2003</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and for some reason, everyone was</ital>

<ital>playing poker all of a sudden.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama</ital>

<ital>used to host a weekly how-do-you-do</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and all the stars</ital>

<ital>came out to show off their tricks.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,</ital>

<ital>Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>the dog from </ital>Frasier,

<ital>and at the head of the table?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Whoops. Woh-oh.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I thought, "Here's a rube."</ital>

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
<ital>But Lady Luck had other plans.</ital>

</line>


<line>
You know what,

I got an essay to write,

so if this isn't about the precipitous

fall of the French ruling class--

</line>


<line>
<ital>But then I saw, the kid had a tell.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I feel like that story had a lot

of unnecessary details in it.

</line>


<line>
Listen. You have to pay close attention,

it's subtle,

but when he gets excited, his ears ever

so slightly flop up and give him away.

</line>


<line>
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been

flopping upwards his whole career.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

</line>


<line>
[horn blows]

</line>


<line>
Time's up, Daniel.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, looks like D to the R

to the Ad to the Cliffe

just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

</line>


<line>
And BoJack barely got beyond

his thesis statement.

</line>


<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>


<line>
[clears throat]

"A continent ravaged by war,

coupled with the retreat

of the church from secular life..."

</line>


<line>
-And then it just stops?

-[audience laughs]

</line>


<line>
Oh, that's gonna cost

you some serious pesos.

</line>


<line>
But first, it's time for

our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

</line>


<line>
A buzz-in round? All right.

</line>


<line>
In is my favorite direction

in which to buzz.

</line>


<line>
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

to build an 18th century triple-decker

Royal Navy battle ship?

</line>


<line>
A, 75? B, 1000?

</line>


<line>
Or C, 3500?"

</line>


<line>
C! 3500!

</line>


<line>
-Um, correct.

-Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
-Uh, wow. That's, uh...

-[mild applause]

</line>


<line>
That's actually correct.

</line>


<line>
How the hell did he know that? What else

does he know? Does he know things?

</line>


<line>
Let's find out.

</line>


<line>
Quantum tunneling.

King Magnus the Second.

</line>


<line>
Miss Scarlet in the library

with the lead pipe.

</line>


<line>
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

</line>


<line>
-Because seven eight nine.

-[buzzes]

</line>


<line>
What an amazing run.

It looks like we've got a tied game.

</line>


<line>
Which is an exciting surprise.

</line>


<line>
-Goddamn it, throw to commercial.

-We'll be right back.

</line>


<line>
[lively music playing over speakers]

</line>


<line>
-Hey. Horshack. What's going on?

-What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, you know, you're doing great,

but I'm supposed to win.

</line>


<line>
That was the deal.

Plug my movie, win money for charity.

</line>


<line>
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

</line>


<line>
By the way,

your girlfriend has a stripper name.

</line>


<line>
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, according to this app,

you're almost tied.

</line>


<line>
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.

Congratulations.

</line>


<line>
Thanks. It was touch and go--

</line>


<line>
But I'm a little concerned

because it seems like

you might actually win,

but everyone on the app

is really rooting for Daniel.

</line>


<line>
People love him.

</line>


<line>
I guess he was in some movie about a

potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

</line>


<line>
-Are you asking me to throw the game?

-You don't care about this game.

</line>


<line>
The only reason you're here is for me,

so maybe you could help me out?

</line>


<line>
-[sighs] Okay.

-You know what?

</line>


<line>
You're the best, no matter

what everybody on this app says.

</line>


<line>
They say you're the worst. Especially

Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

</line>


<line>
[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
And we're back. Contestants, I've got

a history question for both of you.

</line>


<line>
"You may or may not be familiar with a

famous racehorse named Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
In what year did Secretariat

win the Triple Crown?"

</line>


<line>
-[buzzer sounds]

-BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Piece of cake.

</line>


<line>
Hmm?

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Um, 1492?

</line>


<line>
-[audience and Daniel laughing]

-What? No, not even close.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, aren't you in a movie

about Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
-How could you not know that?

-Let's just move on.

</line>


<line>
Maybe instead,

he should be in a movie

about a guy who doesn't know

anything about Secretariat. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
That would not be a good movie.

</line>


<line>
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

</line>


<line>
Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

</line>


<line>
Do you know anything about Secretariat?

You know he was a horse, right?

</line>


<line>
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

</line>


<line>
No wonder my wife

had to write your book for you.

</line>


<line>
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking

about your wife, I've got a question.

</line>


<line>
How come your wife flew

all the way to war-torn Cordovia

just to get away from you?

</line>


<line>
[people murmuring]

</line>


<line>
That's not what happened.

She went to help people.

</line>


<line>
Or maybe she went to help herself

get away from her awful marriage.

</line>


<line>
[audience gasping]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, was that too far?

-Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

</line>


<line>
-Well, I mean--

-No, no, no, let's get into things.

</line>


<line>
Let's get real.

Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

</line>


<line>
Cancel the Bubble Round.

Because we're getting real.

</line>


<line>
[production assistant sighs]

</line>


<line>
Should we cut to commercial?

</line>


<line>
Would Homer cut away

from Odysseus's journey

just as he was being enticed

by the sirens' song?

</line>


<line>
No?

</line>


<line>
Well, there you are.

</line>


<line>
Things are getting real out here.

Really real.

</line>


<line>
Really, really, really real!

</line>


<line>
[audience member clears throat]

</line>


<line>
-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--

-Oh, no?

</line>


<line>
You knew

where you were going with my wife

that time you pulled over

by the side of the road.

</line>


<line>
-You know, a week before we got married?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
You want to talk about the time when you,

my "good friend," kissed my wife?

</line>


<line>
-No!

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
Did something

exciting just happen?

</line>


<line>
Because people on the app are,

and I quote, "losing their tits."

</line>


<line>
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to

a cancer support message board.

</line>


<line>
Okay, how do I...?

</line>


<line>
How did you know about that?

</line>


<line>
Well, there are roadside cameras

all along the PCH,

</line>


<line>
I have a few friends

in the highway patrol,

and she told me, of course! We're married!

</line>


<line>
Wait, so you've known all this time?

</line>


<line>
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

</line>


<line>
Um, don't you think

you're pushing them too far?

</line>


<line>
I'll tell you when it's too far.

This is my art, goddamn it.

</line>


<line>
I'm J. goddamn D.

goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

</line>


<line>
[thunder rumbling]

</line>


<line>
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

</line>


<line>
And you treat me like a big joke.

</line>


<line>
You think I don't notice?

Why don't you like me?

</line>


<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter--

-No, tell me.

</line>


<line>
-Because... I'm jealous.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
-Of what? Diane?

-No.

</line>


<line>
Of everything.

Everything comes so easy for you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

</line>


<line>
You're a millionaire movie star

with a girlfriend who loves you,

acting in your dream movie.

What more do you want?

</line>


<line>
What else could

the universe possibly owe you?

</line>


<line>
I want to feel good about myself.

</line>


<line>
The way you do.

And I don't know how.

</line>


<line>
I don't know if I can.

</line>


<line>
Whoa, guys, this is getting

a little heavy, don't we think?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

</line>


<line>
Wow, um, I don't know

if I can forgive you.

</line>


<line>
But I guess we'll find out

right after this break.

</line>


<line>
[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
-Damn.

-Shut up.

</line>


<line>
[all cheering]

</line>


<line>
I knew it. I knew this show would

bring us to the heights of human drama

more powerfully than literature

ever dreamed.

</line>


<line>
Now somebody go out and get me

a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

</line>


<line>
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

</line>


<line>
Whoa-oh!

</line>


<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter!

-Oh, hey Wanda.

</line>


<line>
I'm only half paying attention

to whatever you two are arguing about

but it's killer.

Now all we need is a happy ending.

</line>


<line>
I don't think we can just resolve

everything cleanly in a half-hour.

</line>


<line>
Uh, this is network television.

</line>


<line>
So resolving everything cleanly

in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

</line>


<line>
You want to host a game show where

everyone feels bad at the end?

</line>


<line>
You can get in your little car, drive to

Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

</line>


<line>
But these people want resolution, okay?

</line>


<line>
So you get your little butt back

on that stage and you resolve.

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-[audience applauding]

</line>


<line>
And we're back.

</line>


<line>
You know, I did some thinking

over the break. BoJack--

</line>


<line>
-[electricity powers down]

-[audience gasps]

</line>


<line>
-What's going on?

-Oh, my God.

</line>


<line>
No! No! What's happening?

</line>


<line>
-[all chattering]

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
[electricity powers up]

</line>


<line>
Someone unplugged the main power line

and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

</line>


<line>
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

</line>


<line>
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

</line>


<line>
Mia, good work.

You saved the show.

</line>


<line>
You earned my respect... and this pen.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, thank you.

-[all cheering]

</line>


<line>
Aww.

</line>


<line>
Oh, are we back? We're back!

Live television, folks.

</line>


<line>
You know, during the break,

my producers told me

</line>


<line>
I had to forgive BoJack

live on the air.

</line>


<line>
[audience booing]

</line>


<line>
But I'm my own dog.

</line>


<line>
And as my own dog, I decided

to forgive BoJack live on the air!

Bring it in, buddy!

</line>


<line>
-What?

-Really?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I applaud your forgiving nature,

but this guy kissed your wife.

</line>


<line>
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

</line>


<line>
The only way to even the score

is if you get to kiss him.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, what?

-You're right, it makes perfect sense.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, absolutely.

-No, it doesn't.

</line>


<line>
That way Diane and I will have

had the same experience.

</line>


<line>
It's the only way we can move past this.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, if it helps us move past this,

I guess...

</line>


<line>
[Daniel and audience] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

</line>


<line>
[J.D.] Cue the Kiss Cam.

</line>


<line>
[love song playing over speakers]

</line>


<line>
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam

for <ital>Catcher In The Rye.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, just one more regret

on a long list of many.

</line>


<line>
Todd, there you are. You're missing

a pretty big moment out there.

</line>


<line>
I don't care. You said it yourself.

Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

</line>


<line>
Not for nothing, but you were worthless

before you didn't get the pen.

</line>


<line>
I really tried this time. I guess

I'll never really amount to anything.

</line>


<line>
Well, maybe you just need

someone to believe in you.

</line>


<line>
Wow, no one's ever

fallen for that!

</line>


<line>
-What?

-You're so stupid!

</line>


<line>
You had the pen

and you just gave it to me?!

</line>


<line>
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

</line>


<line>
The pen is just a symbol.

It doesn't--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, said the girl

who doesn't have a pen right now.

</line>


<line>
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,

immature, aggravating,

irritating, crazy-making...

</line>


<line>
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

</line>


<line>
That's the story of

how I met... this pen.

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup

and give me back my pen!

</line>


<line>
I got your pen.

That means you respect me.

</line>


<line>
-No it does not.

-Viva Todd-foolery!

</line>


<line>
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Hey, hey!

-[blows raspberry]

</line>


<line>
-[lively music playing over speakers]

-[audience cheering]

</line>


<line>
Well, that stern but supple kiss

puts you over the top.

</line>


<line>
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

</line>


<line>
[dog howls]

</line>


<line>
-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

</line>


<line>
You can walk away right now

or, and remember, this is for charity,

you can risk it all in

our Double or Nothing round.

</line>


<line>
[audience clamoring]

</line>


<line>
I wanna risk it all!

</line>


<line>
All right. Now that's $500,000.

</line>


<line>
If you get this question right,

you double that,

a million dollars for charity.

</line>


<line>
But if you get it wrong,

the charity gets nothing

and all the money will be set on fire

live here on our studio soundstage.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, for all the marbles:

</line>


<line>
"Which famous actor

played the titular role

in the popular <ital>Harry Potter</ital>

film franchise?"

</line>


<line>
-[audience] Oh.

-Huh.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I don't know.

</line>


<line>
When you're as famous as I am,

you meet so many people,

it's impossible to remember them all.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

</line>


<line>
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

</line>


<line>
Are you serious right now?

Dude, this is for charity.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, we need an answer.

-Yeah, I don't know.

</line>


<line>
Gosh, I wanna say...

</line>


<line>
-Elijah Wood?

-What?

</line>


<line>
Elijah Wood?!
