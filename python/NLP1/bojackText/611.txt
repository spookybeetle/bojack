  <title>Sunk Cost and All That - BoJack Horseman</title>
  
  



  
  


<line>
[Todd] Watch out!

</line>


<line>
-Lift with your legs.

-I am lifting with my legs.

</line>


<line>
-Also lift with your arms.

-[Joshua] Is Horse Professor okay?

</line>


<line>
Nothing to see here!

</line>


<line>
He just passed out from pride!

Because you kids are so talented!

</line>


<line>
[students cheering]

</line>


<line>
You think he passed out

from embarrassment?

</line>


<line>
-Because the kids are not talented.

-What happened?

</line>


<line>
He was getting off a phone call.

</line>


<line>
I had some constructive criticism

about his play.

</line>


<line>
I tried a compliment sandwich

by starting with some praise,

but he passed out!

</line>


<line>
Just goes to show,

you never know how much time you have

with someone,

so you should always say

the bad stuff first.

</line>


<line>
-[gasping]

-BoJack! Your play sucked!

</line>


<line>
They found out. I didn't--

</line>


<line>
-It's not true.

-What's not true?

</line>


<line>
I need to-- Air.

</line>


<line>
[students singing]

<ital><music>♪ For he's our trusty director ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
No. They can't know.

I didn't even do anything.

</line>


<line>
-It's--

-Slow down.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you tell us what happened?

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'll tell you.

But you can't talk to anyone.

</line>


<line>
No reporters.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, it's okay.

No one's gonna talk to any--

</line>


<line>
Reporters? With questions about

my good friend, BoJack Horseman?

</line>


<line>
I'd be delighted to talk!

</line>


<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
[music playing over stereo]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Baxter,

my endlessly encouraging enfianced.

</line>


<line>
I'm thrilled to report our return

from a prolonged New Mexican exodus.

</line>


<line>
True, Max and I shared lodging

to husband our expenditures,

and true, too, we showered together

one night when the tank broke down

and the hot water was scarce,

but other than those mild inconveniences,

the fact-finding mission went as fine

as the print at the bottom

of a contract,

and we're close as ever

to sewing things up.

</line>


<line>
So, BoJack sold the restaurant

to Joey Pogo and me,

</line>


<line>
and we relaunched it with

my fiancée Pickles as a themed eatery.

</line>


<line>
What is the theme?

</line>


<line>
Pickles wanted small plates,

Joey wanted lazy Susans,

and I wanted the theme to be my face

is on the front of the menu.

</line>


<line>
So, we did all three! [laughs]

</line>


<line>
-What's the big idea?

-I'm in the middle of eating!

</line>


<line>
Huh? It's the perfect compromise

because everybody got what they wanted,

and nobody had to compromise!

</line>


<line>
-And why is it called Ele-fee-no?

-Ele-fi-no.

</line>


<line>
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!

</line>


<line>
I know this last story

is taking its sweet time,

but once we can tie down

this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn

on the night of her death,

we'll know he procured the final blow,

the blow being not blow but horse,

a scoop in itself,

</line>


<line>
but I believe the larger story is--

Oh, but here I am bending your ear.

</line>


<line>
Your everlasting patience inspires me.

Do return my call. This is Paige Sinclair.

</line>


<line>
-And then I took the boat back to LA.

-That's it? How's that a story?

</line>


<line>
You did nothing illegal, and even

the not illegal thing, you didn't even do.

</line>


<line>
And yet this thing continues

to haunt me, I--

</line>


<line>
-Because it's not about the legality.

-[Todd] Diane's right.

</line>


<line>
That story is super sketchy.

</line>


<line>
-Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is!

-[Ruthie laughs]

</line>


<line>
-[pounds on door]

-Can Horse Professor come out?

</line>


<line>
 We won't go to the cast party

unless our fearless teacher comes with us!

</line>


<line>
Why don't you just have the party here

and he'll pop out when he's ready.

</line>


<line>
Here's some cash.

Go buy some nice cast party things.

</line>


<line>
[students cheering]

</line>


<line>
[Joshua] This is gonna be

the best night ever!

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, you're right.

I've been sketchy.

</line>


<line>
But there's no story here. Right?

</line>


<line>
-Unless New Mexico isn't the story.

-Uh, what?

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch

that story, no one would publish it.

</line>


<line>
They're working on something bigger.

What did you do this time?

</line>


<line>
I haven't done anything.

</line>


<line>
Since I got out of rehab

I have been on my best behavior.

</line>


<line>
But before rehab...

</line>


<line>
No. They can't get me on old shit.

I'm a different person now.

</line>


<line>
-This could be anything.

-Or a combination of things.

</line>


<line>
They're gonna combo me?

</line>


<line>
Let's take a beat

and figure out what this story is.

</line>


<line>
-Todd, earmuffs.

-On it.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, tell us every bad thing

you ever did.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] This is gonna be a long night.

</line>


<line>
So, what can I tell you about BoJack?

Nothing bad, though. [laughs]

</line>


<line>
It's gonna be a short night!

</line>


<line>
-Right. I-- Your chair, Miss Sinclair.

-Thanks, Mr. Banks.

</line>


<line>
And thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter,

for taking the time to quench our queries.

</line>


<line>
This shouldn't take more than

a half hour, max.

</line>


<line>
-Yes?

-No, not you Max.

</line>


<line>
-Then who Max?

-No, Max. I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
No, you're talking to Max.

I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
Now I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>


<line>
-Glad we're all on the same page.

-I beg your pardon.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

we have sitch in the kitch.

</line>


<line>
It's a dishwash ish.

</line>


<line>
-The dishwashers all quit?

-It's the small plates.

</line>


<line>
If we just had bigger plates,

we could get more stuff on them

and we wouldn't need so many.

</line>


<line>
The point of the small plates

is to curate a personalized

dining experience,

but because of your lazy Susans,

all the plates keep getting spun around

and nobody remembers who ordered what!

</line>


<line>
Oof! And then there's me,

putting my picture on the menu!

</line>


<line>
-What? No one cares about that.

-Yeah, the pic's not the problem.

</line>


<line>
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you start

on those dishes?

</line>


<line>
You got it, good buddy.

</line>


<line>
Oh... [sighs]

</line>


<line>
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.

Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.

</line>


<line>
Sure. But...

</line>


<line>
Could I talk to you?

</line>


<line>
How much longer do we have

to keep working with that guy?

</line>


<line>
I thought you loved Joey Pogo!

</line>


<line>
I love his music!

</line>


<line>
He's my second favorite recording artist

after Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats

to study/relax to.

</line>


<line>
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats

to study/relax to!

</line>


<line>
And I love you!

</line>


<line>
But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite!

</line>


<line>
He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful,

and fake-nice.

</line>


<line>
You are confident,

refreshingly optimistic,

and wryly sweet

with an ironic self-aware edge

that reads to some as inauthentic,

but I recognize as archly sincere!

</line>


<line>
Total opposites!

</line>


<line>
Okay. So, Pogo's not gonna work,

but I guess we keep trying?

</line>


<line>
I can proposition some young men on set.

That should end well.

</line>


<line>
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.

I'll try to make it work. For us.

</line>


<line>
Now, if we're to finish this story,

we need to stay focused.

</line>


<line>
The last days of Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
I'm telling you, the story is bigger

than just the one girl!

</line>


<line>
If we pivot our perspective

so we prove a larger pattern,

we can paint a clearer portrait

of a problematic person

for a page-one profile

that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!

</line>


<line>
Paige, please! At the rate we're going,

we'll never file the story,

you'll remain unmarried,

and I'll be stuck bickering with you

until the day I die!

</line>


<line>
Oh, poor baby.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, where were we?

</line>


<line>
-We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.

</line>


<line>
Oh, brother.

</line>


<line>
-Would you say BoJack is a good person?

-Unequivocally, more or less.

</line>


<line>
-More-more or more-less?

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn--

</line>


<line>
We're trying to understand if your friend

has ever exhibited certain patterns...

</line>


<line>
Argyle? Herringbone?

That man can pull off anything!

</line>


<line>
We're wasting time. Did Sarah Lynn ac--

</line>


<line>
-[dishes crash]

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
I told you not to spin it that fast!

Lazy! Lazy!

</line>


<line>
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be

washing dishes?

</line>


<line>
[both panting]

</line>


<line>
-[scoffs]

-Hey! Where are you going?

</line>


<line>
Okay, let the cat out of the bag

so my curiosity can kill it.

</line>


<line>
What is going on with those two?

</line>


<line>
That's a personal matter.

I'll tell you all about it!

</line>


<line>
[students] Cast party! Cast party!

</line>


<line>
We are having a cast party! [cheers]

</line>


<line>
-[student 1] Yeah!

-They didn't even buy alcohol!

</line>


<line>
Just a disco ball and some capes?

</line>


<line>
These are all the bad things

you think you did?

</line>


<line>
-I swear, this is all I can think of!

-None of these are big stories!

</line>


<line>
-We all know there are more things.

-Jesus Christ.

</line>


<line>
What's the point of working on myself

and getting sober and getting better

if no matter what, there are people

out there just waiting to tear me down?

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, no.

-No, it's not fair.

</line>


<line>
If you start listing every single thing

everyone's done,

</line>


<line>
-then everyone's a monster.

-Nobody's--

</line>


<line>
Who are these reporters, anyway?

</line>


<line>
They're so perfect? I'll bet

there's dirt on them we could dig up!

</line>


<line>
-I don't think that's it--

-That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches

what happens when they try to tear

someone down over their past

without even considering the possibility

that he's changed!

</line>


<line>
-Have you changed?

-Yes, obviously.

</line>


<line>
Because this feels like old BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I like the BoJack who's thoughtful

and directs plays

</line>


<line>
that are emotionally resonant despite

the glaring logical gaps in the plot.

</line>


<line>
It was a showcase of separate scenes!

There was no plot!

</line>


<line>
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.

Call me when new BoJack's back.

</line>


<line>
[door opens, closes]

</line>


<line>
You didn't do any of the dishes?

</line>


<line>
Manual labor featuring me

is just not a fruitful collab.

</line>


<line>
So I just went out

and bought 500 new ones.

</line>


<line>
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

</line>


<line>
When I'm with him,

we finish each other's sentences.

</line>


<line>
Meanwhile, you are always--

</line>


<line>
Interrupting, just to say

the exact thing that you were going to?

</line>


<line>
-Yes! It's so--

-Annoying?

</line>


<line>
Thank you. That's the word.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.

You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.

</line>


<line>
What if we just tell Mister

we've formed an emotional bond,

then we can have sex,

and we'll never have

to see each other again!

</line>


<line>
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?

-I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

</line>


<line>
That's what got us into this mess

in the first place!

</line>


<line>
[scoffs]

</line>


<line>
So, as soon as they go to bed

with each other,

we can put this whole thing to bed,

but the problem is...

</line>


<line>
-She loves him.

-No, the opposite.

</line>


<line>
No, the opposite of the opposite.

The very thing itself: she loves him.

</line>


<line>
Why do you say that?

</line>


<line>
You've got irises, haven't you?

And pupils and corneas?

</line>


<line>
You might even say you've got

a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

</line>


<line>
Yes.

</line>


<line>
So how could you not see the way that

she follows him across the restaurant

like the puppy dog she is?

How they bicker and flirt?

</line>


<line>
Why would she fall

for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo

when she's already engaged to sweet,

dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
She only tolerates that other fellow

because she has to, for work.

</line>


<line>
Otherwise she finds him

utterly distasteful.

</line>


<line>
Piggish even! No offense to me.

None taken, of course. [snorts]

</line>


<line>
No, she loves him,

though she'd never admit it,

even to herself.

</line>


<line>
[gasps] And what about the boy?

</line>


<line>
Sure, he puts up a front

and picks a good fight,

but to just once hear

those stupid words "I love you"

tumble out of her foolish mouth

would drop his heart down

an elevator shaft

and bounce it back up to his throat.

</line>


<line>
-Yes?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
I... Well, that's all very...

[breathing rapidly]

</line>


<line>
-Back to BoJack!

-And Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
Would you say

BoJack's relationship with her

ever bordered on inappropriate

in the weeks leading up to her death?

</line>


<line>
No! They were closer than thieves!

They were thieves, actually.

</line>


<line>
They broke into my house together,

like great friends do,

and stole our clothes.

</line>


<line>
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!

</line>


<line>
But she was able to find another one

shortly thereafter

that looked exactly the same.

</line>


<line>
-Pardon me.

-Hello. Joseph?

</line>


<line>
Can I get an announcement drumroll,

please?

</line>


<line>
[beatboxing]

</line>


<line>
Never mind.

</line>


<line>
Joey and I have developed feelings

for each other.

</line>


<line>
Oh!

</line>


<line>
[sputtering]

</line>


<line>
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but--

No, that's wonderful.

</line>


<line>
It's exactly what we wanted.

</line>


<line>
It is! So now we make love,

after which we can all get on

with our lives.

</line>


<line>
Great! This is good.

</line>


<line>
Look, we're not gonna

figure this out tonight.

</line>


<line>
Maybe I should just go

to the cast party and try to enjoy--

</line>


<line>
-[Diane and Carolyn gasp]

-[phone buzzing]

</line>


<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>


<line>
Yes. Um, speaking.

</line>


<line>
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair,

of the "Hollywoo Reporter."

</line>


<line>
[BoJack and Carolyn gasp]

</line>


<line>
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
Uh... What night? Did I see BoJack with...

</line>


<line>
Uh...

</line>


<line>
Listen, I'd love to talk more,

but, uh, I cut my finger earlier

in a bagel guillotine and I think

I require medical attention, goodbye.

</line>


<line>
-Bagellotine.

-[phone beeps]

</line>


<line>
It's Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
[exhales sharply]

</line>


<line>
[Pickles sighs]

</line>


<line>
Well, uh, that was...

</line>


<line>
-Wow.

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
Well, see ya later.

</line>


<line>
[shuddering]

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick

to you earlier.

</line>


<line>
The truth is, since Mr. Peanutbutter

has been such a good friend

and chill hang,

</line>


<line>
I was nervous

I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

but once we were in it,

it was like we were two naked hearts

raw and exposed but safe in the home

we found in each other.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Did you just come up with that?

</line>


<line>
No, it's from my new song,

</line>


<line>
"Two Naked Hearts (Raw Dog Remix)."

</line>


<line>
-Oh. Sounds like another banger.

-Best of luck with your wedding.

</line>


<line>
One day I hope to have what you two have.

</line>


<line>
Right now, I couldn't even imagine

getting married.

</line>


<line>
I can't even commit

to a social media director.

</line>


<line>
Why not?

</line>


<line>
I'm just having a hard time finding

someone who gets my brand, you know?

</line>


<line>
Sexy?

</line>


<line>
That's exactly right, you totally get me.

</line>


<line>
So, if you think of anybody who could be

good for the job, let me know, all right?

</line>


<line>
-I will.

-All right.

</line>


<line>
I'm headed to the airport now

for another in a series of extravagant

world tours all by myself.

</line>


<line>
At least I'll have

the empty seat next to me

that I always book for extra comfort.

</line>


<line>
I'll be at gate six.

</line>


<line>
I'm just saying this information out loud

so I don't forget it.

</line>


<line>
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, Joey!

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Um, here's your jacket back. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Thanks, Pickles.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.

</line>


<line>
So Sarah Lynn. That's okay.

</line>


<line>
-We can spin this.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
What are we spinning?

</line>


<line>
You went on a bender with her,

at some point you split up and she died.

</line>


<line>
That's the story, right?

</line>


<line>
If you want us to help you,

you need to tell us what's coming.

</line>


<line>
You know what I thought?

</line>


<line>
The first thing I thought

when I heard Sarah Lynn died?

</line>


<line>
Poor BoJack,

that he had to find her like that.

</line>


<line>
That's right.

Poor BoJack, that's the angle!

</line>


<line>
But then I kept thinking.

</line>


<line>
I wish I didn't,

but my stupid brain kept thinking.

</line>


<line>
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

</line>


<line>
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,

you kept it in your glove compartment.

</line>


<line>
-Diane...

-I didn't wanna think about it,

but I couldn't help but wonder.

Did you give it to her?

</line>


<line>
I... Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Yes.

-And then what?

</line>


<line>
-You just abandoned her?

-No, I--

</line>


<line>
You just left her alone,

an addict, with heroin?

</line>


<line>
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

</line>


<line>
I was with her the whole time!

I was with her when she died!

</line>


<line>
-Like "with her" with her?

-In the planetarium.

</line>


<line>
I left and came back

and pretended I'd found her that way.

</line>


<line>
I... I've never told anyone that.

</line>


<line>
That's really bad, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
Do the reporters know that?

</line>


<line>
I don't know how they could.

I covered my tracks.

</line>


<line>
How did you "cover your tracks"?

</line>


<line>
-[knocking on door]

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
Oh. Hey. Uh, what's up?

</line>


<line>
[Helena] We're doing

end-of-year superlatives,

and we thought it would be cool

if you came out and read some.

</line>


<line>
Oh, um...

</line>


<line>
Just, uh, give me a minute.

</line>


<line>
[muffled chatter]

</line>


<line>
-This was supposed to be a celebration.

-We can still figure this out.

</line>


<line>
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.

</line>


<line>
-Let me just have this one night.

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-[Helena] It's Horse Professor!

-[students laughing, cheering]

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.

</line>


<line>
Okay. You wanted me

to read these, right? Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Um, well, for Best Old Man... Terry.

-[students cheering]

</line>


<line>
-[Terry] Thank you. Thank you so much.

-Okay. Sit down, Terry. Just sit down.

</line>


<line>
Sit down. If you start talking,

then we'll all be old! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
For Best Director...

Oh, Horse Professor. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-That's me.

-[cheering]

</line>


<line>
-[Joshua] Speech!

-No, I-- Okay, okay, okay!

</line>


<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
I just want to say that I've loved

being here with you this year.

</line>


<line>
You've shown me the type of person

I didn't know I wanted to be.

</line>


<line>
And this semester,

I got to be that person.

</line>


<line>
Thank you.

</line>


<line>
And I just... I want you all

to appreciate this time,

and how special it is,

and how fast it'll all go away.

</line>


<line>
Please, cherish this.

</line>


<line>
And I have my own superlative

to announce.

</line>


<line>
I, um... [clears throat]

</line>


<line>
Oh. Uh, hmm...

</line>


<line>
For the Best Actor or Actress...

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie!

</line>


<line>
-[students cheering]

-[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Okay, everyone. Enjoy your party.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Hi, I just gotta tell you

how much I'm loving

the small plates and lazy Susans.

</line>


<line>
I put my fork down and I never know

what I'm gonna pull back up!

</line>


<line>
-You've really made dinner fun again.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
And did you notice my picture

on the front of the menu?

</line>


<line>
Uh, sure. I mean that part

I could take or leave,

but the small plates and lazy Susans

work together perfectly

to form a completely new kind

of upscale dining experience.

</line>


<line>
Exactly like dim sum,

but with white people food,

so it's more accessible.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, well, thank you.

-Huh! Tragic, isn't it?

</line>


<line>
What is?

</line>


<line>
I just keep thinking

about Pickles and Pogo.

</line>


<line>
They've finally acknowledged

that they love each other,

</line>


<line>
-but she's promised to another.

-Yes. To me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, right!

So, you know better than anyone.

</line>


<line>
Someone's up to something,

I can tell you that much.

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife

regularly consume bagels?

</line>


<line>
Hey, why don't you two mind

your own business? How about that?

</line>


<line>
As payrolled journalists,

our business is minding your business.

</line>


<line>
I'm not going to help you

with your take-down piece on BoJack.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, no?

-He's a good guy.

</line>


<line>
And you have no idea

how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.

</line>


<line>
In fact, he was with her

in the planetarium when she overdosed.

</line>


<line>
-He actually gave her the heroin!

-Oh?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. He told me that once

when he was drunk,

and then he said,

"I've never told anybody that."

</line>


<line>
Because he's modest.

So why don't you just leave him alone?

</line>


<line>
[huffs]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Max, it's all coming together!

</line>


<line>
I could just about kiss someone

if I had someone here to kiss!

</line>


<line>
-Listen, I've been meaning to discuss--

-The story?

</line>


<line>
It's cooking now. Smell that sizzle?

</line>


<line>
We've gotta build on it.

More angles, more leads, more...

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-Oh...

-My...

</line>


<line>
I-- You know, I think our story

is about as wrapped up as a mummy.

</line>


<line>
What?

</line>


<line>
I'd better hightail it to the office

and put ink on paper.

</line>


<line>
But what about establishing

a larger pattern of behavior?

</line>


<line>
We still haven't heard back

from the New Mexico girl

or our contact

at the rehabilitation clinic.

</line>


<line>
Don't you think we ought

to keep working together?

</line>


<line>
No, I think I ought to get married.

You were right all along, Banks, my boy.

</line>


<line>
The story is Sarah Lynn. It always was.

</line>


<line>
-Taxi!

-[horn honks]

</line>


<line>
Wait! Paige! I, uh...

</line>


<line>
-I love you!

-Oh, Max. Of course you do.

</line>


<line>
Everybody does. I'm Paige Sinclair!

</line>


<line>
[tires screeching]

</line>


<line>
So, what happens?

When the story comes out, what do I do?

</line>


<line>
A statement about how sorry you are

about certain parts of the story

but other parts of the story

just aren't true.

</line>


<line>
No, you--

</line>


<line>
Then in everyone's head

you've apologized for the really bad stuff

without legally implicating yourself.

</line>


<line>
-Does that work?

-All the time.

</line>


<line>
No, it doesn't.

Why are you telling him to lie?

</line>


<line>
Because this is good.

This BoJack here is good.

</line>


<line>
This is working, but it's so precarious.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm not gonna lose

my job here, right?

</line>


<line>
The Sarah Lynn stuff,

that has nothing to do with this.

</line>


<line>
-Right.

-No.

</line>


<line>
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,

and the two of you are talking

like you're trying to brainstorm ways

to get back on the plane.

</line>


<line>
That's not gonna happen.

</line>


<line>
You can try to find a parachute

or you can dive headfirst into the earth,

but the plane is gone.

</line>


<line>
You're seeing things in absolutes.

We can wriggle out of this.

</line>


<line>
-Who's "we"?

-Diane, I'm asking you for help.

</line>


<line>
This job is my lifeline.

</line>


<line>
I think you should do the hard thing

and be honest.

</line>


<line>
About everything. Things will get worse

before they get better,

but you won't spend the rest of your life

waiting for the other shoe to drop.

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, just think--

[Paige] <ital>Paige Sinclair,</ital>

<ital>"Hollywoo Reporter."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Is this a Mr. BoJack Horseman?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Y-yes.

-<ital>Fabulous.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>We're running a story Thursday next</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>about your relationship with Sarah Lynn</ital>

<ital> leading up to her death.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I wanted to give you a chance</ital>

<ital>to respond to these allegations.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I presume you will deny them,</ital>

<ital>as is customary,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but this is me doing my due diligence</ital>

<ital>and reaching out for comment, understood?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Uh, yeah.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now, did you supply Sarah Lynn</ital>

<ital>with the drugs found on her person?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No.

-[Diane scoffs]

</line>


<line>
<ital>All right. And did you use heroin</ital>

<ital>with Sarah Lynn during those last weeks?</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No.

<ital>-Uh-huh.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Were you with her when she died?</ital>

</line>


<line>
Um... No.

</line>


<line>
<ital>And did you lie to the police</ital>

<ital>about any of these things?</ital>

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Thank you for your time.</ital>

-[line disconnects]

</line>


<line>
What happened to being honest?

</line>


<line>
I didn't think it would happen so fast.

Did she say next Thursday?

</line>


<line>
That gives us a week to plan.

We can minimize damage.

</line>


<line>
"We" are not doing anything.

</line>


<line>
-Diane, please.

-I can't be a part of this.

</line>


<line>
I have a book to write.

</line>


<line>
[grunts] Oh, my God!

</line>


<line>
They're all making out out here!

Go to your dorms!

</line>


<line>
You have rooms!

</line>


<line>
Well, we did it.

And by "it," I mean <ital>doing it.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Oh-ho! Fantastic.

</line>


<line>
So, now we're even,

and everything can go back to normal.

</line>


<line>
I can't wait. First step:

let's set a date for the wedding.

</line>


<line>
Joey has a job opening on his tour

that I think could be

a real opportunity for me.

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight,

and I might be gone for a while.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-Oh, Mister, I'm so confused!

</line>


<line>
I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan,

just spinning in all directions.

</line>


<line>
And I know I should be ready

to commit to a main course,

but right now I'm just so excited

about all the different small plates

out there, you know?

</line>


<line>
It sounds like maybe this is a bad time

to have my face printed

on the cover of your metaphorical menu.

</line>


<line>
What? Oh, yeah.

I forgot about that part of it.

</line>


<line>
Go on Joey's tour. Have a good time.

</line>


<line>
And we'll plan the wedding...

when I get back?

</line>


<line>
Sure, Pickles... when you get back.

</line>


<line>
-Sounds like a good compromise.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. The best.

</line>


<line>
Everyone gets what they want

and no one had to compromise.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God, I gotta go!

</line>


<line>
-Okay, I love you!

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, for everything. [kisses]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Hey! Sad Dog!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>


<line>
-I think the party's over.

-[BoJack] Yeah.

</line>


<line>
What do you got?

</line>


<line>
"My relationship with Sarah Lynn

was complicated,

as relationships between addicts

often are.

</line>


<line>
However, certain aspects of the story

are inaccurate or exaggerated.

</line>


<line>
This story has started

an important conversation

and I look forward to continuing to work

on my own progress..."

</line>


<line>
There's-- There's no way

to not sound like bullshit.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, well...

</line>


<line>
This place was supposed to be

a fresh start for me.

</line>


<line>
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.

</line>


<line>
But no matter how many starts I get,

there's always the same ending.

</line>


<line>
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

</line>


<line>
-I'm still here, BoJack.

-Why?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

</line>


<line>
And you were my first client,

and one time you were drunk

and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

</line>


<line>
And you said, "I just like being in a room

with you. You make rooms good."

</line>


<line>
You still do.

</line>


<line>
I have loved you for 25 years,

and I never loved anyone better.

</line>


<line>
That kind of love, you only get it

when you're young and stupid.

</line>


<line>
I'm not gonna get it again.

</line>


<line>
And when I tell my daughter the story

of the great love of my life,

</line>


<line>
I want it to have a happy ending.

</line>


<line>
Is it possible you letting me go

is the happy ending?

</line>


<line>
I've gone with you this far.

In for a penny, in for a pound, right?

</line>


<line>
Sunk cost and all that?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, sunk cost.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
The story's coming out Thursday.

</line>


<line>
I don't think that we can get around this,

or over this, or try to get under it.

</line>


<line>
-Diane is right. We need to go through it.

-BoJack--

</line>


<line>
I need to take responsibility.

</line>


<line>
I want to.

</line>


<line>
So you can tell your daughter

you helped me do the right thing.

</line>


<line>
-I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.

-I'm looking forward to it.

</line>


<line>
-You sure?

-I mean, no.

</line>


<line>
