<line>
Why do I have to go to this thing?

</line>


<line>
If we want to be

a legitimate awards contender,

</line>


<line>
<ital>Secretariat </ital>needs to make an appearance

at a big festival.

</line>


<line>
-I can't just go to Cannes?

-You Cannes not.

</line>


<line>
Apparently, the French do not care for you

ever since you said that thing

in the press.

</line>


<line>
Hey, I stand by my critique of Sartre.

</line>


<line>
His philosophical arguments helped

tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty.

</line>


<line>
Also, the French smell and I hate them.

</line>


<line>
And you can't go to Sundance

because Robert Redford hates you.

</line>


<line>
Someone had to tell him

<ital>The Horse Whisperer </ital>was offensive.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, but real horses don't just do

whatever someone says.

</line>


<line>
And that's why you need to go

to this festival.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] If you say so.

</line>


<line>
The Pacific Ocean Film Fest, or POFF,

is the biggest underwater film festival

in the world.

</line>


<line>
You make a splash there,

people are going to notice.

</line>


<line>
Fine.

</line>


<line>
All you need to do is get

to the premiere on time, 8:00.

</line>


<line>
Walk the red carpet, wave at the crowd,

kiss some fish babies.

</line>


<line>
[groans] Fish. They're so annoying.

</line>


<line>
-[squeaking]

-Sorry, lady. No <ital>habla </ital>fish talk.

</line>


<line>
You need to be sensitive to their culture.

Things are different down there.

</line>


<line>
You know what a thumb's up means, right?

</line>


<line>
Yes, I know what a thumb's up means.

I'll be fine.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I wanted to warn you.

</line>


<line>
Kelsey Jannings

is also going to be at the festival.

</line>


<line>
-Kelsey? No.

-She has another film there.

</line>


<line>
I haven't talked to her

since she got fired from <ital>Secretariat.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Well, luckily you won't have to talk much

because you'll both be underwater.

</line>


<line>
God, I haven't been underwater

since my mother tried to drown me

in the bathtub when I was 22.

</line>


<line>
I can't do this, Ana. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
-Sir.

-I'm getting off.

</line>


<line>
You can't.

We've already pressurized the cabin.

</line>


<line>
-Sir, please return to your seat.

-No. I don't want to do this.

</line>


<line>
You can't make me.

</line>


<line>
I'm a land creature.

I don't belong down there.

</line>


<line>
You can lead me to water,

but you cannot make--
