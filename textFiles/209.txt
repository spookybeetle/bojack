<line>
[thunder rumbling]

</line>


<line>
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

</line>


<line>
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

</line>


<line>
I'm president of the goddamn

United States of America.

</line>


<line>
Isn't that right, Checkers?

</line>


<line>
That's what it says

on your business cards.

</line>


<line>
There are going to be riots

in the streets.

</line>


<line>
I'm Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
You think I'm afraid

of a few rioting hippies?

</line>


<line>
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

</line>


<line>
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

</line>


<line>
Please, I'll do anything.

</line>


<line>
You gotta send someone else

in my place.

</line>


<line>
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...

arranged.

</line>


<line>
<ital>I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.</ital>

<ital>My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>which is necessary</ital>

<ital>to protect our way of life.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And another hero is President Nixon.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>He is one groovy dude.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] Groovy.

</line>


<line>
[coughing]

</line>


<line>
What the hell are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Sorry, Mommy!

</line>


<line>
Don't you dare put that out.

</line>


<line>
That is a perfectly good cigarette,

and you are going to finish it.

</line>


<line>
But I don't wanna.

</line>


<line>
And I don't want to be

the mother of a quitter.

</line>


<line>
Finish it.

</line>


<line>
[coughing]

</line>


<line>
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke

a cigarette right.

</line>


<line>
Don't you dare cry,

don't you ever cry.

</line>


<line>
You wanted this.

</line>


<line>
Are you punishing me for smoking

or for stealing?

</line>


<line>
I'm punishing you for being alive.

</line>


<line>
Ugh.

</line>


<line>
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw

a lit cigarette off the--

</line>


<line>
[fire roaring]

</line>


<line>
Fine. I'll call 911.

</line>


<line>
[♪♪]

</line>


<line>
The fire department got

everything under control,

</line>


<line>
but the cable's out

for the neighborhood.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand

what started the fire.

</line>


<line>
Nobody knows where fires come from,

it's a mystery.

</line>


<line>
Anyway, I am fired up

about my first day back on set.

</line>


<line>
We're gonna finish

that big Nixon scene.

</line>


<line>
We were just one shot away

before we went on hiatus.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I know.

You told me at breakfast.

</line>


<line>
Why did you call me?

</line>


<line>
Usually I talk to Diane

on the way to work,

</line>


<line>
but she abandoned me to teach piano

in Cordovia or something.

</line>


<line>
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me

because Diane wasn't available.

</line>


<line>
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill

in this Nixon scene.

</line>


<line>
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

</line>


<line>
In da White House.

</line>


<line>
What happened to da house set?

Da White House set?

</line>


<line>
-Things changed a little.

-You cut the Nixon scene?

</line>


<line>
The Nixon scene is the core

of the whole movie.

</line>


<line>
Where we see Secretariat

be morally corrupted

and get to look

into the real darkness of his soul.

</line>


<line>
It's still all that,

except now it happens

while you give a Christmas present

to your nieces

and they hug you

while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

</line>


<line>
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

</line>


<line>
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

</line>


<line>
People don't want

all that controversial stuff.

</line>


<line>
But we were supposed to make

a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
-Warts and all.

-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

</line>


<line>
That's why they took the gay stuff

out of <ital>A Beautiful Mind.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Know that guy who spent 12 years

as a slave?

</line>


<line>
They don't talk about the 60 years

he spent as a jerk.

</line>


<line>
-Kelsey, you're okay with this?

-Eh...

</line>


<line>
That's showbiz.

</line>


<line>
See, BoJack,

that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

</line>


<line>
Good shrugging, kid.

</line>


<line>
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

</line>


<line>
That's the end of your name.

We need to talk.

</line>


<line>
We'll meet in the supply closet

in one minute. Break!

</line>


<line>
Oh, okay.

</line>


<line>
Ooh, ow.

</line>


<line>
Carolyn, when you're in the throes

of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

along with all that pain and degradation

comes a certain perfect clarity,

and right now that clarity is telling me

that you and I should get out of here.

</line>


<line>
Well, what do you mean,

"get out of here"?

</line>


<line>
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,

and I want you to be my partner in crime.

</line>


<line>
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

</line>


<line>
I've been here 20 years.

</line>


<line>
Who's gonna water the plants?

</line>


<line>
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

</line>


<line>
I started doing it as an intern,

but then no one told me to stop,

so it's still kind of my job.

</line>


<line>
Carolyn,

you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

</line>


<line>
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

</line>


<line>
Things are so crazy

for me right now. I--

</line>


<line>
Don't give me that, you want crazy.

"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

and your second favorite

Gnarls Barkley song.

</line>


<line>
I don't want crazy.

</line>


<line>
I've got five episodes

of <ital>The Good Wife </ital>piled up on my DVR,

and I just want a night off

to enjoy them.

</line>


<line>
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess

I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

</line>


<line>
-[Carolyn] Gekko?!

-But I'd rather look at you all day.

</line>


<line>
You're an amazing agent.

And you're bright, and you're fun.

</line>


<line>
And I think we could make something

really special.

</line>


<line>
We weren't doing anything!

We were just looking for closet supplies.

</line>


<line>
Are you the person to talk to

about unclogging the toilet?

</line>


<line>
Stuart, I'm your boss.

</line>


<line>
Okay, but you're the one

in the janitor's closet, so...

</line>


<line>
-What, I'm the idiot?

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>The first thing you notice</ital>

<ital>about Sebastian St. Clair</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is that he speaks in paragraphs.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Even I can't believe

how much good we've done here,

and I'll believe almost anything.

</line>


<line>
In the last six weeks,

we dug a new well, built a school,

and next month

the community center is doing <ital>Seussical.</ital>

</line>


<line>
There we go.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>In his previous life,</ital>

<ital>Sebastian owned</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>a chain of high-end department stores.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I want to stock up on muffs.

</line>


<line>
We're going to sell a lot of muffs

this winter. Huzzah!

</line>


<line>
Diane, I lived a life

of power and luxury,

and then my picture

was in the newspaper.

</line>


<line>
-A real-life newspaper!

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
But I knew my life was empty.

</line>


<line>
<ital>At night I heard the cries</ital>

<ital>of children sick and dying.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I would scream into the night.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Shut up! Shut up, children!

</line>


<line>
<ital>But the phantom cries would not abate.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And so I began my travels,

with little more than a compass,

a yearning for adventure,

and several crates full of unsold muffs.

</line>


<line>
I knew there were people out there

just waiting for my help.

</line>


<line>
Diane, this is Kinko.

</line>


<line>
I am Kinko.

</line>


<line>
In his language, it means,

orphan whose parents were murdered

by rebels and will die young,

probably from malaria.

</line>


<line>
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

</line>


<line>
It means,

my parents liked the show <ital>Cheers.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Cheers! </ital>Oh, you're good.

You're very good.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>When Sebastian St. Clair says</ital>

<ital>you're good,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>you want to believe</ital>

<ital>that you really are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>That you, like Sebastian, are part</ital>

<ital>of something bigger than just yourself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And for a moment,</ital>

<ital>you feel like you are.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[Sebastian] Oh, Kinko made a mess.

</line>


<line>
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is

way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

</line>


<line>
And cut. Neat.

</line>


<line>
-Let's break for lunch.

-[kids] Oh!

</line>


<line>
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

</line>


<line>
I had to touch three children today,

and one of them was sticky.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it was you.

Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.

-No, this isn't you.

</line>


<line>
I've seen everything you've done.

</line>


<line>
Your films are challenging and gritty,

and they're great.

</line>


<line>
I'm not just saying that

because they're full of lesbians.

</line>


<line>
Look, even if I wanted to finish

that Nixon scene,

we don't have an Oval Office set.

</line>


<line>
There's one at the Nixon Library

in Yorba Linda.

</line>


<line>
Why on earth do you know that?

</line>


<line>
In season three of <ital>Horsin' Around,</ital>

the horse got elected president

and we shot on location.

</line>


<line>
We can sneak into the library

and get the shot, guerilla-style.

</line>


<line>
Once Turteltaub sees it,

he'll love it,

and we can make the movie

we both want to make.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.

-All right!

</line>


<line>
Did they really make

your character president?

</line>


<line>
Only for season three.

</line>


<line>
In season four, it turned out

it was all a dream.

</line>


<line>
They called my airplane <ital>Air Horse One.</ital>

</line>


<line>
And the vice president was

a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

</line>


<line>
-Come on.

-It wasn't our best season.

</line>


<line>
But on the bright side,

was not our worst.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and steal the scale model.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

</line>


<line>
I'm Nixon. [chuckles].

</line>


<line>
[in normal voice] Yeah, you know,

some people say I look like Nixon.

</line>


<line>
Not because he's my dad or anything.

That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

</line>


<line>
But if you have any questions about Nixon,

I'd be happy to answer them.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

</line>


<line>
Is that the lighted exit sign

from Nixon's boyhood home?

</line>


<line>
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

</line>


<line>
-Is that...

-Here we go.

</line>


<line>
...the handicapped drinking fountain

he used in the White House?

</line>


<line>
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

</line>


<line>
-Hang on.

-One more.

</line>


<line>
-Is that the smoke alarm--?

-No.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles nervously]

</line>


<line>
So the Oval Office is right here,

next to the men's room.

</line>


<line>
I remember because season three

of<ital> Horsin' Around </ital>was a big cocaine year.

</line>


<line>
All the pressures of being president.

</line>


<line>
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.

-We're gonna need a crack team.

</line>


<line>
First, we gotta get

the best lock-pick in the city.

</line>


<line>
-Not interested.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>The second best lock-pick in the city.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-No way I'm doing that.

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
<ital>A lock-pick.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Todd, can you pick locks?

</line>


<line>
-Kind of.

-Great. You're in.

</line>


<line>
<ital>We'll need an expert cat burglar.</ital>

</line>


<line>
All right, <ital>Good Wife,</ital>

let's see what you got.

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

</line>


<line>
Kelsey and I are gonna break

into the Nixon library

to steal a shot

for our Secretariat movie.

</line>


<line>
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper

that stands to benefit you in no way.

</line>


<line>
Are you in?

</line>


<line>
[man] Hey! Shut up down there!

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack] You shut up!

-[man] Make me!

</line>


<line>
[BoJack] Hey, you got a problem?

Take it up with my agent,

your downstairs neighbor

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
[groans]

</line>


<line>
[BoJack]

<ital>We'll need someone to play Checkers.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

</line>


<line>
What does Ethan Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

but I'm super-busy recording promos

for television's

highest-rated new game show.

</line>


<line>
-We can probably do it without you.

-This next one's for Seattle.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

</line>


<line>
What does Ethan Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Rain.

</line>


<line>
It's too bad though because I could

really bring a lot to this project.

</line>


<line>
The more I think about it,

Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

</line>


<line>
It's just a single on Secretariat.

</line>


<line>
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.

What does Ethan Hawke know?

</line>


<line>
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.

-You know what? Forget I even asked.

</line>


<line>
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Character actress Margo Martindale,

you've been a model prisoner.

</line>


<line>
I'm glad I served my time.

</line>


<line>
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

and get back to doing small roles

in critically-acclaimed films

and television shows.

</line>


<line>
[prison guard] Watch, purse, lipstick,

</line>


<line>
Emmy Award

for Best Guest Actress.

</line>


<line>
[sighs deeply]

</line>


<line>
I need your help with a break-in.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, I've been out of prison

for two minutes.

</line>


<line>
What took you so long?

</line>


<line>
[tires squealing]

</line>


<line>
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I

are gonna break into the library.

</line>


<line>
But the problem is,

the place is crawling with cops.

</line>


<line>
They're on high alert

because some idiot

stole this model last night.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

</line>


<line>
[laughs] Who am I kidding?

I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

</line>


<line>
Look at your big saucer eyes.

I can go swimming in them!

</line>


<line>
-Totally.

-Now, we need to lose the cops.

</line>


<line>
The rest of you will create a diversion

by breaking into the only other place

in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

the Discount Fine Art Gallery

in the strip mall,

between the tanning salon

and the adult bookstore.

</line>


<line>
Once you set off the alarm,

all the cops will go there.

</line>


<line>
[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

</line>


<line>
Now, things could get ugly.

One of you is very likely to die.

</line>


<line>
-Possibly Alan.

-Why possibly Alan?

</line>


<line>
Well, you are the guy

none of us knows that well.

</line>


<line>
I just came to fix your cable.

</line>


<line>
Alan, you already know too much.

You're a part of this now, like it or not.

</line>


<line>
-But--

-Hey, you think you could keep it down?

</line>


<line>
I'm reading a script

and I'm having trouble focusing,

so now my notes are

gonna be confusing and vague.

</line>


<line>
We're almost done.

</line>


<line>
I know you're having fun

with your police cars,

</line>


<line>
I just wish you would have asked

before you invited these people over.

</line>


<line>
-I live here, too.

-You're right. I'm sorry.

</line>


<line>
And can you at least let Alan

fix the cable before he dies?

</line>


<line>
I can't die. I'm endangered!

</line>


<line>
[Diane] "And the truffle-infused gnocchi

was the star dish

at this up-and-comer that will please

the pickiest of Brooklynites

and the less discerning Staten Islander."

</line>


<line>
When I grow up, I can be food critic

for <ital>New Yorker?</ital>

</line>


<line>
You can do anything you want in life.

</line>


<line>
Not everyone can write for <ital>The New Yorker,</ital>

but there's always <ital>The Atlantic.</ital>

</line>


<line>
[Sebastian] Diane,

</line>


<line>
I'm concerned you're spending

a lot of time with this sickly child.

</line>


<line>
Remember, you're supposed

to be writing about me.

</line>


<line>
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?

To help these people?

</line>


<line>
I'm here to help these people.

</line>


<line>
You're here to help me help them

by writing a book about me

so people back home will give money

to my foundation.

</line>


<line>
Great.

</line>


<line>
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

</line>


<line>
[alarm wailing]

</line>


<line>
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

</line>


<line>
One of us isn't going

to come out of this alive.

</line>


<line>
Why do you all keep saying that?

</line>


<line>
Why can't we all assume we're gonna

make it out alive and go from there?

</line>


<line>
Alan, we've got enough problems without

worrying about your imminent death.

</line>


<line>
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

</line>


<line>
Why does everything have to be

a big, complicated mess?

</line>


<line>
Like,

look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

</line>


<line>
It's simple.

</line>


<line>
And serene. And... pleasant.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
I think that the vest

makes me look kind of chunky.

</line>


<line>
I don't do CrossFit five days a week

to not look sweet in this uniform.

</line>


<line>
I swear to God,

if you don't shut up about CrossFit--

</line>


<line>
[woman over radio]

<ital>Break-in at the Discount</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Let's roll!

That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

</line>


<line>
[police sirens wailing]

</line>


<line>
[BoJack shouts]

</line>


<line>
Remember when my character

on <ital>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </ital>was

</line>


<line>
-elected president?

-Let me guess, it was all a dream?

</line>


<line>
No, I served half a term,

then resigned

because when Zachary

had a bad time with peer pressure,

</line>


<line>
I realized I was spending

too much time being president

and not enough time being a dad.

</line>


<line>
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I'd like you here.

</line>


<line>
And then you are going to be over here.

</line>


<line>
-Freeze!

-I'm union.

</line>


<line>
-Playing dead.

-Breaking and entering?

</line>


<line>
That is against everything

Nixon stood for.

</line>


<line>
We didn't mean to cause trouble.

We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

</line>


<line>
Yeah? What, another leftist screed

about how corrupt he was?

</line>


<line>
-Uh...

-Or is it about how he had

an illegitimate son,

and the son never knew who his dad was,

but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

and then that son grew up to be

the security guard at the Nixon Library?

</line>


<line>
The second one?

</line>


<line>
Well, if that's true, how come you don't

have an actor here to play Nixon?

</line>


<line>
Because...

we couldn't find anyone who could

appropriately capture his magic.

</line>


<line>
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

</line>


<line>
You? No way.

</line>


<line>
[as Nixon] Hello, I'm Nixon.

</line>


<line>
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am

your father and I love you very much.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

</line>


<line>
We've found our Nixon.

</line>


<line>
[in normal voice] I can be ready in five.

</line>


<line>
Uh. Did we get the shot?

</line>


<line>
It's so peaceful.

</line>


<line>
-Okay, folks.

-[all] Aah!

</line>


<line>
Party's over.

That's something we say at CrossFit.

</line>


<line>
Ugh. Wait a sec-- I know you!

</line>


<line>
You were in <ital>Justified.</ital>

You were amazing.

</line>


<line>
Okay, you caught me.

</line>


<line>
I am kind of

a well-known character actress.

</line>


<line>
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh--

</line>


<line>
What--? What's your name?

</line>


<line>
Sure, of course.

</line>


<line>
Everyone loves my work,

but apparently not enough

to watch the credits

and find out what my name is.

</line>


<line>
The important thing is that we enjoy

your great performances, right?

</line>


<line>
-How about you enjoy this? Aah!

-[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>


<line>
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

</line>


<line>
Oh, is that what we agreed to?

I thought we said "no gum."

</line>


<line>
But you're also chewing gum.

</line>


<line>
I'm a wild card.

</line>


<line>
-Aah!

-Return fire!

</line>


<line>
Watch out!

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

</line>


<line>
No, I'm fine.

The bullet hit my cell phone.

</line>


<line>
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

</line>


<line>
Nope, phone's fine, too.

Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

</line>


<line>
She's going into labor.

Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

</line>


<line>
See you later!

</line>


<line>
-[police sirens wailing]

-[guns cocking]

</line>


<line>
Die, you chunky assholes!

</line>


<line>
See, Jeff?

This is what I'm talking about.

</line>


<line>
[all shouting]

</line>


<line>
[cop] Shoot!

</line>


<line>
Oh.

</line>


<line>
-How could this be any more perfect?

-[sing-song] Yoo-hoo.

</line>


<line>
Vanessa Gekko.

How did you get in this painting?

</line>


<line>
I'm your servant, of course.

</line>


<line>
In your infinite generosity,

you gave me this job

when it became clear

that I don't have what it takes

to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

</line>


<line>
Also, my husband left me.

</line>


<line>
And my children married each other

in an unholy incestuous union.

</line>


<line>
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

</line>


<line>
How appropriate!

Fetch me drink, wench.

</line>


<line>
-Right away, ma'am.

-Ah.

</line>


<line>
Diane...

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>The second thing you notice</ital>

<ital>about Sebastian St. Clair</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is how much he talks about himself.</ital>

</line>


<line>
This way is the library I built.

</line>


<line>
And over there is the statue

of me building the library.

</line>


<line>
And on that wall is a painting

of me posing for the statue.

</line>


<line>
-Put a chapter in your book about that.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>The only respite</ital>

<ital>from his constant bombast is sleep,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>and even then, sometimes...</ital>

</line>


<line>
[bomb whistling, explodes]

</line>


<line>
-[Diane gasps]

-[people scream nearby]

</line>


<line>
Everybody--

Those of you who can walk, I mean.

</line>


<line>
--let's drag these corpses

to the mass grave behind the playground.

</line>


<line>
We need to make room

for my new hospital.

</line>


<line>
-Where's Kinko? Is he okay?

-Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

</line>


<line>
See, Diane,

I told you not to make friends.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, you don't care

about any of these people.

</line>


<line>
You're just using them as props

for your big-shot superhero act.

</line>


<line>
Diane, the dead will not benefit

from our grief,

but the survivors need a new hospital

and we need to build it.

</line>


<line>
This is too much.

</line>


<line>
If you're going to survive,

you'll need to harden up.

</line>


<line>
I asked you to join me

because I thought you could handle it.

</line>


<line>
-But if you can't, you can go home.

-I...

</line>


<line>
I can handle it.

</line>


<line>
Great! Let's drag some bodies!

Kinko! Oh, never mind.

</line>


<line>
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line

and I don't get a line?

</line>


<line>
We only gave him a line

so he wouldn't call the police.

</line>


<line>
-If I call the police, will I get a line?

-No, we won't use it in the movie.

</line>


<line>
We only need the one-shot of me.

</line>


<line>
I just think if he gets a line,

I should get a line.

</line>


<line>
-Ugh. Actors.

-Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

</line>


<line>
[as Nixon] I'm Nixon.

</line>


<line>
The way you're feeling

about your dead brother is how I feel

about the son I'll never know.

</line>


<line>
But I look at the moon and so does he.

That's how I know we're connected.

</line>


<line>
And I'm Checkers.

</line>


<line>
[Kelsey] All right, so, BoJack,

you've been told

that your brother, Jeffretariat,

the one Nixon sent to Vietnam

in your place, is dead.

</line>


<line>
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

</line>


<line>
And the tears start to flow.

</line>


<line>
And the tears start to flow.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

</line>


<line>
Well, you need to.

This is the emotional climax of the movie.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front

of other people. I can't.

</line>


<line>
Really, never? Come on.

</line>


<line>
What if someone tells you

they'll take you to the park,

and they keep talking about the park

and all the fun you'll have,

but then... [sobs]

</line>


<line>
But then they don't take you to the park.

I need a second.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

</line>


<line>
Can you give us the room, please?

</line>


<line>
There's a park right outside

we can hang out at.

</line>


<line>
-Oh!

-Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

</line>


<line>
Ah.

</line>


<line>
Well, another beautiful, serene day

in magical fantasy-painting world.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,

I have some exciting news.

</line>


<line>
I just landed a new client.

</line>


<line>
-The mill owner!

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
We're doing a three-picture deal

about his waterwheel.

</line>


<line>
-Wait, you're making deals here?

-I'll say.

</line>


<line>
I'm now the biggest agent

in the entire idyllic New England village.

</line>


<line>
It's like you don't even read

the idyllic New England village trades.

</line>


<line>
What? No!

</line>


<line>
You're polluting my perfect serene

dream life. Why is this happening?

</line>


<line>
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

</line>


<line>
But if you ask me, I don't think

you want perfect and serene

and enough time to catch up

on <ital>The Good Wife.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Stop kidding yourself,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
If you really wanted the simple life,

you'd have a simple life.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

</line>


<line>
[sing-song] Bye!

</line>


<line>
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.

Now this place is all mine.

</line>


<line>
Get your demo guys together.

</line>


<line>
Let's tear this old Tudor down

and put up some condos! [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
[Margo laughing]

</line>


<line>
This isn't just for me.

</line>


<line>
It's for John Carroll Lynch,

C.C.H. Pounder,

and all the other character actors

who live in lucrative obscurity.

</line>


<line>
The blood I spill today is for us all!

</line>


<line>
I'm character actress Margo Martindale!

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I'm going to go

with Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
[laughing and grunting]

</line>


<line>
Hmm.

</line>


<line>
[cell phone ringtone]

</line>


<line>
-Hello?

-Hey.

</line>


<line>
There you are!

I've been trying to call you all week.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is--

<ital>-Diane, Diane.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Listen, I gotta tell you:

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry I gave you such

a hard time about your trip.

</line>


<line>
The truth is,

I really am so proud of you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>A lot of people talk big,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but you're actually out there</ital>

<ital>helping people.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>You're the real deal, Diane.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-Yeah...

-How is it there? Is it amazing?

</line>


<line>
It's... good.

</line>


<line>
It's hard, but it's good.

</line>


<line>
I miss you.

</line>


<line>
I miss you, too, but I promise,

these six months are gonna fly by.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. How's the game show going?

</line>


<line>
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed

to be hosting a game show right now.

</line>


<line>
[upbeat dance music playing]

</line>


<line>
[caws]

</line>


<line>
I gotta go.

</line>


<line>
[Diane] <ital>And that's when you realize</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that the book you've been writing</ital>

<ital>in your head</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>is never actually going to be a book,</ital>

<ital>so you stop--</ital>

</line>


<line>
I know what you're gonna say.

</line>


<line>
I'm a dumb sitcom actor

who's in over his head.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

</line>


<line>
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry for everything.

I don't know what I'm doing.

</line>


<line>
BoJack, sit down.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
You've just been told your brother is dead

and that it's your fault.

</line>


<line>
But this moment is bigger than that.

</line>


<line>
This is the moment

that Secretariat stops running.

</line>


<line>
Because this is the moment you realize

something inside you is broken,

and it can never be fixed.

</line>


<line>
We got it.

</line>


<line>
Really? I didn't cry.

</line>


<line>
You didn't have to.

Turteltaub's gonna love this.

</line>


<line>
-Oh. All right.

-Thanks for talking me into this.

</line>


<line>
Just so you know, I'm really glad

we're making this movie together.

</line>


<line>
-Didn't know I had it in me, did you?

-No, I knew.

</line>


<line>
Huh.

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
-Hold the elevator, please.

-Coming in?

</line>


<line>
-I'm all in.

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.

Where's Uncle Secretariat?

</line>


<line>
He had to go win a race

against the Russians.

</line>


<line>
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

</line>


<line>
-Hey, where's Kelsey?

-Oh, yeah, funny story.

</line>


<line>
Turns out you two knuckleheads

snuck out last night

and got that shot

I told you not to get for the scene

</line>


<line>
-that's not in the movie anymore.

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
Silly me, I didn't like that.

So I fired her ass.

</line>


<line>
-What?

-We got a movie to finish, okay?

</line>


<line>
So, go get in costume,

get your butt up that chimney,

and do your thing, Hamlet.

</line>


<line>
Just maybe,

all we have to do is believe!

</line>


<line>
[slurping]

</line>


<line>
What are you doing here?

</line>


<line>
Hey, is it cool if I crash here

for a couple nights?

</line>


<line>
I didn't know where else to go.
