  <title>Time's Arrow - BoJack Horseman</title>
  
  



  <h4>
  


<line>
Slow down, Henrietta.

A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

</line>


<line>
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

</line>


<line>
My son is a ball of gas.

</line>


<line>
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.

I'm the ball of gas!

</line>


<line>
But you're also a star.

</line>


<line>
Wait. Mom, do you remember--

</line>


<line>
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

</line>


<line>
Sun, you're a ball of gas,

but you're also a star.

</line>


<line>
-We call you... "Sun."

-Ugh!

</line>


<line>
Where are you taking me?

Are we going to the lake house?

</line>


<line>
No, we're going

to a glorious magical place

where they'll lock you

in a room by yourself

so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

</line>


<line>
Oh, that sounds lovely.

Why are you driving so slowly?

</line>


<line>
-Hurry up!

-Wait. You just said--

</line>


<line>
Time's arrow neither stands still

nor reverses, after all.

</line>


<line>
It merely marches forward.

Isn't that right, Henrietta?

</line>


<line>
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

</line>


<line>
[humming]

</line>


<line>
Well, here we are.

</line>


<line>
-Here?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
[humming]

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>


<line>
-[wind gusting]

-[children laughing]

</line>


<line>
[coughs]

</line>


<line>
[laughter]

</line>


<line>
Halt! No entry.

</line>


<line>
-But I wanna slide.

-This is no mere slide.

</line>


<line>
We three are members

of an elite society

</line>


<line>
of extremely young women,

</line>


<line>
led by I,

Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

</line>


<line>
You may not enter.

</line>


<line>
-Yeah, and also you're fat.

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
I'm not fat. [coughs]

</line>


<line>
Even your lungs expostulate

</line>


<line>
as they struggle to expel

your ample corpulence.

</line>


<line>
She's saying your lungs

think you're fat too.

</line>


<line>
Father says I'm just growing.

</line>


<line>
If you do not halt, we will be forced

to physically impede your egress.

</line>


<line>
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow!

</line>


<line>
[cries out]

</line>


<line>
[grunts]

</line>


<line>
-[girls laughing]

-[crying]

</line>


<line>
Beatrice, stop reading

and put on your uniform.

</line>


<line>
Father, I don't feel well.

[coughing]

</line>


<line>
I don't care if you're scared

of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

you have to go to school.

</line>


<line>
Now stop making books your friends.

</line>


<line>
Reading does nothing for young women

but build their brains,

</line>


<line>
taking valuable resources away

from their breasts and hips.

</line>


<line>
-But my throat hurts.

-Uniform! Now!

</line>


<line>
[moans]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.

</line>


<line>
Dear Lord.

</line>


<line>
[Joseph] Now listen here, it's

a mother's duty to keep her children alive

</line>


<line>
and you are continually failing!

</line>


<line>
How could you not have known

she has scarlet fever?

</line>


<line>
Say something, damn it!

What has become of you?

</line>


<line>
I swear if I'd known

this is how you'd behave

once we severed the connections

to your prefrontal cortex,

</line>


<line>
I'd hardly have bothered.

</line>


<line>
-Father?

-[gasps] Yes, darling?

</line>


<line>
Am I to die?

</line>


<line>
Well, eventually yes,

but this illness is but a hiccup

in what will be a long and happy life,

</line>


<line>
-I promise.

-You promise?

</line>


<line>
In fact, some good

may yet come of this.

</line>


<line>
Doctor says your throat

is nearly swollen shut.

</line>


<line>
So perhaps you'll finally lose

some of that weight

that's given you such troubles.

</line>


<line>
-Won't that be nice?

-Yes, Father.

</line>


<line>
-Ow!

-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

</line>


<line>
Polly, be a darling and fetch me

a pretty pill

and a glass of water, won't you?

</line>


<line>
Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

</line>


<line>
Beatrice, you're looking well,

which is just fine,

</line>


<line>
because your debutante party

is vitally important.

</line>


<line>
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

or bring back civil rights

activist Medgar Evers,

who was shot in Mississippi

this week?

</line>


<line>
Yes! Or rather, it will end you

worrying about that nonsense

because it will land you a husband.

</line>


<line>
At least Evers' death means no one else

will be assassinated this year, 1963.

</line>


<line>
The FBI is on too high alert to allow

anything like that to happen again.

</line>


<line>
-Hmm?

-Yes... well...

</line>


<line>
Your chaperone,

Corbin Creamerman,

is a fine young man.

</line>


<line>
Oh, jeez.

</line>


<line>
-My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.

-Thanks.

</line>


<line>
So... uh, you look nice.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, Corbin.

That's the third time you've told me.

</line>


<line>
You needn't tell me again.

</line>


<line>
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

I'm not always good at these things.

</line>


<line>
But sometimes I am.

I can be. I-- I really try to be.

</line>


<line>
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.

I don't know why.

</line>


<line>
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

</line>


<line>
[Joseph]

Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

is founder of Creamerman's

Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

</line>


<line>
Think of all the free iced cream

you could, uh, serve to other people.

</line>


<line>
Father, do you aim to marry me off

to Corbin Creamerman

merely because it would be good

for business?

</line>


<line>
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

of how a Sugarman/Creamerman

alliance might be advantageous.

</line>


<line>
-Uh-huh.

-For example,

imagine a television advertisement

with a fun jingle.

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital><music>♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪</music></ital>

</line>


<line>
And then it's Mort and me,

and we're holding up our products

with big smiles from across

a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

</line>


<line>
Father, common Americans

don't want you on their TV sets.

</line>


<line>
You're a reminder of the disparity

of wealth in this country.

</line>


<line>
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

</line>


<line>
You know, I sent you to Barnard

to get your MRS

from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

but instead of a bachelor

you returned home

with a bachelor's degree

and a mouth full of sass.

</line>


<line>
What a waste!

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-[Corbin] <ital>You look nice.</ital>

-Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?

Doth my eye belie me?

</line>


<line>
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.

Why are you here?

</line>


<line>
I must say,

it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

</line>


<line>
Better late than never, hmm?

[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,

who has very old-fashioned ideas

about how a woman is to live her life.

</line>


<line>
Poor Corbin here is saddled

with chaperoning me.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

</line>


<line>
In truth,

I find these parties to be garish,

self-serving wastes of money.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and I'm sure yours

was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

</line>


<line>
[spits and coughs]

</line>


<line>
Oh, my! How repugnant!

</line>


<line>
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

</line>


<line>
-Do I know you?

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Nope, just crashing some dumb

debutante's party. [chuckles]

</line>


<line>
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"

to describe the party or the debutante?

</line>


<line>
Because I might agree with you,

or I might be offended.

</line>


<line>
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

</line>


<line>
Beatrice Sugarman.

Welcome to my dumb party.

</line>


<line>
Butterscotch Horseman.

Charmed, I'm sure.

</line>


<line>
You crash a lot of these?

</line>


<line>
I'll take my free alcohol

where I can get it.

</line>


<line>
Saving for California.

</line>


<line>
What's in California?

</line>


<line>
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

</line>


<line>
This is where you ask me

if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

</line>


<line>
I am familiar with the Beats,

thank you.

</line>


<line>
I like Ginsberg all right,

but if you ask me,

that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

</line>


<line>
-What's your interest in them?

-What's my interest?

</line>


<line>
They're the greatest minds

of our generation.

</line>


<line>
I'm heading west to join them,

because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

</line>


<line>
-I see.

-You will see.

</line>


<line>
I'm writing the next

Great American Novel.

</line>


<line>
Oh, what's it about?

</line>


<line>
It's about truth! It's about war!

</line>


<line>
It's about the twilighting frontier

of the lives that were promised us.

</line>


<line>
But what is it about?

Who are the characters?

</line>


<line>
I never claimed to have

the whole thing

sorted out just yet, did I?

</line>


<line>
Sounds like a best seller.

</line>


<line>
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing

for a woman to be.

</line>


<line>
I don't know how you expect

to nab a husband at a party like this

with a personality like that.

</line>


<line>
Oh, congratulations. You and my father

express the same concerns.

</line>


<line>
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

</line>


<line>
I'd be anxious

to get you married off, too.

</line>


<line>
I bet your thank-you letters

are perfunctory,

your flower arrangements

are uninspired,

and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

</line>


<line>
-[chuckles]

-[laughs]

</line>


<line>
Looks like you pegged me

as well as I pegged you.

</line>


<line>
[clicks tongue]

</line>


<line>
What must your mother think of you?

</line>


<line>
Oh, she doesn't think much...

about anything, anymore.

</line>


<line>
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

</line>


<line>
-No, not exactly.

-Mine did.

</line>


<line>
I'm very sorry to hear that.

</line>


<line>
I was little. I don't remember, really.

</line>


<line>
But she had a diamond just like yours.

I saw it in a picture once.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I'd like to leave her here.

</line>


<line>
Can I pay for the next five years now

so I don't have to think about her again?

</line>


<line>
-Wha-- Oh.

-[Corbin] Oh, jeez, I--

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry to interrupt,

but we have to do the thing now,

where we do the... things.

</line>


<line>
Oh-- oh, right. Um...

</line>


<line>
-Please excuse me.

-Of course, it sounds very important.

</line>


<line>
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman

present their daughter,

</line>


<line>
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

</line>


<line>
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

</line>


<line>
Look at her go, folks.

</line>


<line>
Clearing every hurdle.

</line>


<line>
Look at that form.

</line>


<line>
What precise movements.

</line>


<line>
-[Beatrice] Five, six...

-[man] Beautiful trot.

</line>


<line>
[softly] Truly outstanding.

</line>


<line>
A lovely lady indeed.

</line>


<line>
-Ta-da!

-[applause]

</line>


<line>
[clears throat]

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Don't you know it's rude to leave

without saying goodbye to the hostess?

</line>


<line>
Why don't you come with me?

</line>


<line>
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,

thus eliminating my transgression.

</line>


<line>
Oh! You want me to leave

my own party with you?

</line>


<line>
The low-life who wasn't even invited?

</line>


<line>
-[glass shatters]

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
But I suppose Daddy

wouldn't like that, would he?

</line>


<line>
[both moaning]

</line>


<line>
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

</line>


<line>
-I have wonderful news.

-I'm reading.

</line>


<line>
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.

He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

</line>


<line>
I am not interested

in Corbin Creamerman.

</line>


<line>
I don't give a damn

where your interests lie!

</line>


<line>
After the disappearing act you pulled

at your own party,

you're lucky I don't fill a jar

with jellied beans

and marry you off to the man

who can closest estimate the amount.

</line>


<line>
Heavens!

</line>


<line>
Corbin Creamerman is willing

to give you a second chance,

he is downstairs waiting,

and you <ital>will</ital> be civil to him.

</line>


<line>
[huffs]

</line>


<line>
And the way they make

non-dairy creamer

is by replacing the milk fat

with vegetable oil.

</line>


<line>
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

</line>


<line>
-Pretty nifty, huh?

-Is that so?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.

-Not at all. I don't find <ital>you</ital> boring.

</line>


<line>
Only the things you choose

to talk about,

and the way in which

you talk about them.

</line>


<line>
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...

I just get excited by food chemistry.

</line>


<line>
You know, you take something

you thought you knew,

and then discover

there's so much more to it

than you could have possibly imagined.

</line>


<line>
-It's like... magic.

-Oh?

</line>


<line>
My father is less enchanted.

</line>


<line>
He says it's just squeezing money

out of cow teats.

</line>


<line>
I suppose that's true,

but I got ideas too,

and I feel I never get to be anything

other than what he expects me to be.

</line>


<line>
You know what that's like?

</line>


<line>
I do.

</line>


<line>
You know, Corbin,

it occurs to me

that perhaps you and I aren't so--

</line>


<line>
-[retching]

-Oh, dear!

</line>


<line>
[screams]

</line>


<line>
[whistles]

Nice gams.

</line>


<line>
[whistles]

Nice gams.

</line>


<line>
Is that the only thing

you can think of to say?

</line>


<line>
[whistles]

Nice... gams.

</line>


<line>
-[sighs]

-Uh...

</line>


<line>
-Beatrice, what are you doing here?

-I had to look you up in the phone book.

</line>


<line>
The number you gave me

was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.

</line>


<line>
What? Are you sure?

</line>


<line>
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

</line>


<line>
-Wha--

-[whistles] Whoa, boy!

</line>


<line>
Come on, Bopper,

can you give us some privacy?

</line>


<line>
Sure thing, Butterscotch.

You take it easy.

</line>


<line>
[whistling]

</line>


<line>
Are you certain it's mine?

</line>


<line>
Well, whose else could it be?

</line>


<line>
What do you wanna do?

Maybe you have a cousin,

who has a... a friend,

who knows a doctor,

who can take care

of such inconveniences?

</line>


<line>
I'm-- I'm happy to do

the gentlemanly thing and...

and pay for the cab fare.

</line>


<line>
No. I can't.

</line>


<line>
Well, that doesn't leave us

with very many options.

</line>


<line>
I'm a ruined woman.

</line>


<line>
Don't be hysterical.

You're not ruined.

</line>


<line>
It's a verifiable fact

you look more beautiful than ever.

</line>


<line>
[scoffs] Oh, what do you know?

</line>


<line>
It was a pretty great night

we had together, huh?

</line>


<line>
It was.

</line>


<line>
Say, did you ever hear the story

of the couple who moved to California?

</line>


<line>
I can't say that I have.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

</line>


<line>
You see, they hardly knew each other,

but they shared a certain sensitivity

and a taste for the unknown.

</line>


<line>
They were living in a one-horse town,

so they headed west,

towards a town that could

accommodate three horses.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, I think I <ital>have</ital> heard this story.

</line>


<line>
They got a small house

in San Francisco near the bookstore.

</line>


<line>
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti

and his scurry.

</line>


<line>
He wrote his Great American Novel...

</line>


<line>
While his wife took care of the baby.

</line>


<line>
His wife?

Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.

</line>


<line>
Well, if she'd have him.

</line>


<line>
If a beautiful creature like herself

could ever love an oaf like him.

</line>


<line>
-I think she could.

-Yeah?

</line>


<line>
And isn't that how the story goes?

</line>


<line>
[jazz plays]

</line>

</line>

</line>


<line>
-[crying]

-Come on, come on, come on.

</line>


<line>
-Sleep.

-The baby's hungry.

</line>


<line>
I tried. He won't eat.

I don't know what he wants.

</line>


<line>
Well, can you figure it out?

</line>


<line>
If I don't sleep, how can I work

to support you and the child,

let alone have energy left over to write?

</line>


<line>
Maybe if anyone wanted to pay you

for anything you wrote,

we'd be able to afford

a nanny and a maid.

</line>


<line>
Well, if Squirrelinghetti

and his horde of commie, liberal,

</line>


<line>
Jew-loving rejects

knew what good writing was,

</line>


<line>
I'd be able to sell something.

</line>


<line>
Oh, so they're all wrong,

and you're right.

</line>


<line>
-[baby wails]

-[both groan]

</line>


<line>
Why won't you just take

that corner office job at Sugarman West

instead of breaking your back

all day at the cannery,

and then maybe you could afford me

some decent help around here?

</line>


<line>
You want me to work for your father,

and get paid for it,

like some sort of slave?

</line>


<line>
-That is the opposite of slavery.

-Is it?

</line>


<line>
Yes, it is!

You have no facility for language.

</line>


<line>
-[baby crying]

-Oh, will you at long last be quiet?

</line>


<line>
You wanted that baby.

Never forget that.

</line>


<line>
I need quiet!

</line>


<line>
[crying continues]

</line>


<line>
[groans] You'd better be worth all this.

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
-Well, you're not.

-I'm not what?

</line>


<line>
Mommy's tired, BoJack.

Tell me a story.

</line>


<line>
-[stammers] Oh, once upon a time...

-[door opens]

</line>


<line>
-[door slams]

-Quiet. Your father's home.

</line>


<line>
How was work, darling?

</line>


<line>
Ugh! Terrible.

Those fish do not like being canned.

</line>


<line>
Well, I burnt dinner, again.

</line>


<line>
But you can pick

at the charred remains

and delight me and your simple son

with stories of your noble,

salt-of-the-earth co-workers

like Eight-Finger Joe

and Sports-Team Steve...

</line>


<line>
-Oh, God.

-...before locking yourself

</line>


<line>
-in your study for the night...

-Know what?

</line>


<line>
...to chip away at your

never-ending goddamn novel.

</line>


<line>
I'll clean up the kitchen,

</line>


<line>
-and bathe our filthy child.

-If you could just--

</line>


<line>
And we'll just keep waltzing

</line>


<line>
-through this goddamn...

-Would you--

</line>


<line>
-...proletariat dream.

-No--

</line>


<line>
Maybe if the goddamn baby

wasn't crying all the time,

</line>


<line>
I could finish the goddamn novel.

</line>


<line>
I'm not a baby. I'm six.

</line>


<line>
Yes, wah, wah, ga, ga, goo, goo.

</line>


<line>
I'm forming sentences.

</line>


<line>
Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.

</line>


<line>
I can see the headline now,

</line>


<line>
"Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is Great,

comma, Son is Idiot."

</line>


<line>
I didn't say your book is great.

</line>


<line>
I can't live like this!

</line>


<line>
I should have married

Corbin Creamerman.

</line>


<line>
Ha! Like he'd have you.

</line>


<line>
Oh, he would have.

And he would have been kind to me.

</line>


<line>
And he wouldn't have been

too much of a stubborn ass

to take a decent job

at my father's company!

</line>

Fine! I'll take the corner office,

with the company car, six-figure salary,

and four weeks paid vacation,

but if my novel becomes bad

because I no longer remember

what it's like to be working class,

we'll know of whom to be blamed.

</line>


<line>
-[door slams]

-Oh.

</line>


<line>
[classical music plays]

</line>


<line>
A little to the left. Good choice.

</line>


<line>
Just over... Careful with that.

That looks great.

</line>


<line>
Hello? You're always in the way.

</line>


<line>
-Why don't you go play?

-Okay.

</line>


<line>
-Go do something.

-Bye, Mom.

</line>


<line>
You are fired. Vacuum.

Thank you. Stat.

</line>


<line>
Goodbye. Thank you.

</line>


<line>
Henrietta, will you help me pack this?

I want to bring it to my son.

</line>


<line>
[laughs] Oh, that's so nice.

I love a good painting.

</line>


<line>
It's like TV without all the talking

and movement.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, what is that ghastly thing?

</line>


<line>
It belonged to Father.

</line>


<line>
I'm giving it to BoJack.

</line>


<line>
I never cared for the aesthetic arts.

Dulls the senses.

</line>


<line>
Art should be straightforward

and utilitarian, like my novel.

</line>


<line>
I can't wait to read it.

</line>


<line>
Books are fantastic.

The words tell stories.

</line>


<line>
-Henrietta, the painting.

-Right away, Mrs. Horseman.

</line>


<line>
I shouldn't have to ask you twice.

</line>


<line>
God gave you two ears

and me only the one mouth, after all.

</line>


<line>
-You could be nicer to her.

-No one's ever nice to me.

</line>


<line>
-Why should I be nice?

-Beatrice...

</line>


<line>
Just because the maid

bats her little eyes at you

and makes barely-qualifying- 

for-conversation conversation,

doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.

</line>


<line>
I don't know

what you're insinuating. I--

</line>


<line>
Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel

like a big smart man,

never challenges you,

and thanks you for helping her

study for nursing school.

</line>


<line>
As a matter of fact,

she <ital>is </ital>studying for nursing.

</line>


<line>
I know. I can hear

your flirting through the wall,

when you're supposedly

"working on your novel."

</line>


<line>
I bet you think

she's falling in love with you.

</line>


<line>
You sensitive, misunderstood artist.

Ugh. Won't she be disappointed.

</line>


<line>
I don't know why you don't

just get a divorce already.

</line>


<line>
Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.

</line>


<line>
"We're out of mustard.

Let's get a divorce!"

</line>


<line>
"I'm a little sad. Divorce!"

</line>


<line>
"We've grown apart over the years

and our adult child

has moved out of the house

and there's no reason for us

to stay together. Divorce!"

</line>


<line>
That actually is a legitimate reason

to get a divorce.

</line>


<line>
Well, who else would have me now?

After what you did to my body?

</line>


<line>
-What I did?

-Anyway, do you want this painting?

</line>


<line>
It belonged to your grandfather,

a man who knew what marriage meant.

</line>


<line>
[muffled dialogue]

</line>


<line>
Sure.

</line>


<line>
I drove it all the way down here,

didn't I?

</line>


<line>
-You might as well take it.

-I said I'll take it.

</line>


<line>
Of course. Take.

That's all you ever do.

</line>


<line>
How long you sticking around for, Mom?

</line>


<line>
[sighs] Just pour me a drink

and I'll be on my way.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up

before you drive up the coast.

</line>


<line>
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.

</line>


<line>
She was the good one?

I always get them confused.

</line>


<line>
I heard your show was canceled.

</line>


<line>
Three years ago now.

You're really on the pulse, huh?

</line>


<line>
I never understood the appeal.

</line>


<line>
-It's just a bunch of silly stories.

-Some people like silly stories.

</line>


<line>
Lotta good they ever did me.

</line>


<line>
It's not Ibsen, but...

</line>


<line>
It would only depress me

to watch you bumble around like that.

</line>


<line>
All the sacrifices I made,

so that you could do this.

</line>


<line>
Thanks for the painting.

</line>


<line>
It'll be nice to have something that

always reminds me of this conversation.

</line>


<line>
[screams]

</line>


<line>
[screaming]

</line>


<line>
[clearing throat]

</line>


<line>
-Uh, Beatrice.

-What?

</line>


<line>
I, uh--

[clears throat]

</line>


<line>
-I gummed things up. [nervous chuckle]

-Oh?

</line>


<line>
It's Henrietta.

</line>


<line>
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

</line>


<line>
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

</line>


<line>
Can you talk to her?

Just woman to woman?

</line>


<line>
She wants to have the baby.

I-- I can't talk her out of it.

</line>


<line>
-What do you want me to say?

-I'm out of options, Bea.

</line>


<line>
You think I enjoy groveling

to my own wife, hat in hand?

</line>


<line>
If you weren't so neglectful

in your wifely duties...

</line>


<line>
-Don't you dare.

-I'm sorry. What do--

</line>


<line>
I don't know what to do. I...

</line>


<line>
Please. Just--

just fix this for me, please.

</line>


<line>
I know you hate me, Bea,

but please just think of the poor girl.

</line>


<line>
[exhales] Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
You're fired, of course.

</line>


<line>
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

</line>


<line>
He was just so kind to me

and I felt so--

</line>


<line>
Let me guess, he said you reminded him

of his dead mother.

</line>


<line>
He said she had hair like mine.

He saw it in a picture once.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Do you really want this child?

-I... I think so?

</line>


<line>
It's a baby horse.

[chuckles] A girl.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,

and tuition keeps going up.

</line>


<line>
None of that is my fault.

</line>


<line>
If I can just finish school

and get a job, it'll be okay.

</line>


<line>
And who's going to care

for the baby while you work?

</line>


<line>
Because God knows he won't.

</line>


<line>
[sobbing]

</line>


<line>
Well, don't do that.

What does that solve?

</line>


<line>
I don't know what else to do,

Mrs. Horseman.

</line>


<line>
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

</line>


<line>
-Really?

-Yes.

</line>


<line>
And you'll give the baby up

for adoption.

</line>


<line>
[gasps]

</line>


<line>
No.

</line>


<line>
You think you want this,

but you don't. Not like this.

</line>


<line>
Mrs. Horseman--

</line>


<line>
Don't throw away your dreams

for this child.

</line>


<line>
Don't let that man poison your life

the way he did mine.

</line>


<line>
You are going to finish your schooling

and become a nurse.

</line>


<line>
You'll meet a man, a good man,

and you'll have a family,

but please believe me,

you don't want this.

</line>


<line>
Oh...

</line>


<line>
Please, Henrietta,

you have to believe me.

</line>


<line>
Please, don't do what I did.

</line>


<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>


<line>
[panting and grunting]

</line>


<line>
[screaming]

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
[screaming]

</line>


<line>
My-- My baby!

Where's my baby?

</line>


<line>
[screaming]

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
[screaming]

</line>


<line>
[crying]

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
-Oh, look at you.

-[chuckles]

</line>


<line>
-You did it, Henrietta.

-[panting]

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>


<line>
[humming]

</line>


<line>
No, no, no. No, please.

</line>


<line>
Please don't. Stop.

</line>


<line>
Stop! Why are you doing this?

</line>


<line>
Beatrice, remember

what we say about crying?

</line>


<line>
-Mm-hmm.

-Crying is stupid.

</line>


<line>
But, Father,

tell them not to burn my things.

</line>


<line>
But, darling, they have to.

Your sickness has infected everything.

</line>


<line>
The hard part is over.

</line>


<line>
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

</line>


<line>
-No. You'll get attached.

-Wait!

</line>


<line>
It all must be destroyed

for your own good.

</line>


<line>
-I need to hold her.

-This is for your own good.

</line>


<line>
-But not my baby.

-Yes. Especially your baby.

</line>


<line>
-Whoop!

-[gasps]

</line>


<line>
See, doesn't that feel better?

</line>


<line>
[Beatrice cries] No!

</line>


<line>
My baby!

</line>


<line>
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

</line>


<line>
-No, no.

-[crying]

</line>


<line>
Wait. No, please come back.

I need to hold her. Please.

</line>


<line>
[screams]

</line>


<line>
No!

</line>


<line>
Come on now, be strong.

</line>


<line>
You can't let your womanly emotions

consume you.

</line>


<line>
You don't wanna end up

like your mother now, do you?

</line>


<line>
[faint screaming in distance]

</line>


<line>
-[sobs] No.

-I promise.

</line>


<line>
One day this will

all be a pleasant memory.

</line>


<line>
Best of luck. See ya never.

</line>


<line>
-Who <ital>is</ital> that?

-[groans] Bye, Mom.

</line>


<line>
BoJack?

</line>


<line>
-Mom?

-BoJack? Is that you?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, it's me.

</line>


<line>
-Well, oh, what is this place?

-This is where you live now.

</line>


<line>
-No. Is it? No.

-Mom...

</line>


<line>
-Where are we, BoJack?

-I just told you.

</line>


<line>
I don't understand.

</line>


<line>
-Where... Where am I?

-You're...

in Michigan.

</line>


<line>
-Michigan?

-Yeah.

</line>


<line>
-At the lake house.

-I am?

</line>


<line>
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,

and the fireflies are dancing

in the sky.

</line>


<line>
And your whole family is here.

</line>


<line>
And they're telling you

that everything is gonna be all right.

</line>


<line>
Yes. That's right. What else?

</line>


<line>
The crickets are-- are chirping,

and the lake is still,

and the night is full of stars.

</line>


<line>
I can see it. It's so clear.

</line>


<line>
What are we doing here, BoJack?

</line>


<line>
We're sitting on the back porch,

and we're listening to your brother

play the piano,

and we're eating ice cream.

</line>


<line>
Vanilla ice cream.

</line>


<line>
Yes. That's right.

</line>


<line>
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

</line>


<line>
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

</line>


<line>
Oh, BoJack.

</line>


<line>
It's so...

delicious.
