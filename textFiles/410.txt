[moans]

</line>


<line>
[muffled] Give it a moment.

</line>


<line>
Nothing gets by me, Tina.

Uno what I'm thinking?

</line>


<line>
-[mutters]

-I don't think you have any blues.

</line>


<line>
I think you put the wild card down,

and chose blue,

because you want us

to think you have blues.

</line>


<line>
-Just go already!

-Uh, excuse me.

</line>


<line>
I am employing

a little something called "strategy."

</line>


<line>
I am taking my time because

I enjoy being the center of attention.

</line>


<line>
Until I put a card down,

you have to listen.

</line>


<line>
It's been your turn

for ten minutes.

</line>


<line>
Well, since you're being so impatient,

</line>


<line>
I'm gonna put my thing down,

flip it and reverse it back to Tina.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-[growls] Uno.

</line>


<line>
So you <ital>did </i>have blues. <i>Touch√©.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Henrietta, don't use a foreign language

in front of the child.

</line>


<line>
She'll get ideas.

</line>


<line>
-It's your turn, Beatrice.

-Ah, ah, ah, ah!

</line>


<line>
-You okay, Hollyhock?

-Yeah, I'm-- I'm awesome.

</line>


<line>
I feel really good.

</line>


<line>
I just-- I need a glass of water.

</line>


<line>
Oh! Beatrice, trying to slip

a nine on a six.

</line>


<line>
You think I've never seen

an old niner-sixer before?

</line>


<line>
-Ah! Ow!

-Whoa, are-- are you okay?

</line>


<line>
I'm fine! I just-- Ow!

</line>


<line>
Did you cut yourself?

It's okay. I know what to do.

</line>


<line>
You need some alcohol, ice,

a squeeze of lemon.

</line>


<line>
-You'll forget all about your cut.

-I'll be right back.

</line>


<line>
One.

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
Oh!

<line>

<line>
<ital>Californians are feeling the pinch,</ital>

<ital>and you butter believe</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>it's "beclaws"</ital>

<ital>of Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I see, you're referring</ital>

<ital>to my hideous transplant lobster claws</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>in an effort to distract--</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Do you want a governor</ital>

<ital>who can be rendered defenseless</ital>

</line>


<line>
-<ital>with two rubber bands?</ital>

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
[Tom Jumbo-Grumbo]

<ital>Woodchuck is down in the polls.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Californians just aren't connecting</ital>

<ital>with his message.</ital>

</line>


<line>
I have a very important

policy announcement.

</line>


<line>
-I've got new hands, baby!

-[crowd cheering]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Now Woodchuck is way up in the polls!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I guess his message</ital>

<ital>was connecting with voters after all.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Hey! How you doin'?

Looking good.

</line>


<line>
-[coos]

-Mmm...

</line>


<line>
-[gasps]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
What's the big deal?

I have hands too.

</line>


<line>
There's no way those new hands

are as perfect as everyone says.

</line>


<line>
Nobody's hands are all the way clean.

Computer, zoom in on that thumb.

</line>


<line>
And enhance. Zoom in again.

</line>


<line>
Enhance again.

</line>


<line>
Zoom in three more times.

Enhance. Enhance.

</line>


<line>
Now zoom out once.

De-enhance.

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
What are you doing?

</line>


<line>
Quiet, "Face."

"Brain" is working on something.

</line>


<line>
Computer, take a scan

on that thumbprint

</line>


<line>
and cross-reference, please.

</line>


<line>
[printer whirring]

</line>


<line>
-Ha! Just what I expected.

-What?

</line>


<line>
<ital>Before Woodchuck,</ital>

<ital>the hands belonged to one</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Ernest Contralto, a criminal.</ital>

<ital>The man was a pedophile murderer.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, if you gotta murder somebody...</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>No, Tom. Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.</ital>

<ital>A pedophile-slash-murderer!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Oh, no! The way you said "slash"</ital>

<ital>was very scary!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>At first I didn't like him,</ital>

<ital>on account, uh... he didn't have hands?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But then he got new hands,</ital>

<ital>so I liked him again?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>But then I found out those hands are bad!</ital>

<ital>Can't trust politicians.</ital>

</line>


<line>
She's killing us on this hands thing.

</line>


<line>
Much like Ernest Contralto

killed those innocent children

</line>


<line>
after he pedophiled them,

with those very hands.

</line>


<line>
Not helping!

</line>


<line>
Your hands are being

really aggressive right now.

</line>


<line>
-[groans]

-Watch out! They're attacking your face!

</line>


<line>
Hey, girl, whatcha working on?

Getting some clicks?

</line>


<line>
Get them clicks, girl.

Get. Them. Clicks.

</line>


<line>
I'm working on another big piece

about how Jessica Biel is owned

</line>


<line>
by private prison lobbyists, who want--

</line>


<line>
Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.

I care and I don't even care.

</line>


<line>
So imagine how little

someone who doesn't care cares.

</line>


<line>
-Well...

-What if you had lunch with her?

</line>


<line>
-Why would--

-You could write about

</line>


<line>
what she smells like,

how she makes her face pretty.

</line>


<line>
These are things people will want

to know about our first female governor.

</line>


<line>
Ugh!

</line>


<line>
[screeching]

</line>


<line>
I'll have the avocado toast.

</line>


<line>
But instead of the avocado part,

I want fresh sea air,

</line>


<line>
and instead of the toast,

I'll have a single grain of rice.

</line>


<line>
-And for you?

-Grilled cheese?

</line>


<line>
Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.

I just wanted to tell you,

you can keep writing

whatever you want about me.

</line>


<line>
Obviously, it has no effect on the polls,

because the only thing voters care about

is stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.

</line>


<line>
Well, today I just want to know

what you smell like.

</line>


<line>
It's actually my new fragrance:

"Bielist," by Jessica Biel.

</line>


<line>
-Your perfume's called "B"-list?

-"Bielist."

</line>


<line>
"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.

</line>


<line>
-No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</line>


<line>
Do you want some?

I got a whole trunk of this stuff.

</line>


<line>
-No, thanks.

-You sure?

</line>


<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter always loved

the way I smelled.

</line>


<line>
Well, I wouldn't flatter

yourself too much.

</line>


<line>
He's very enthusiastic

about smelling in general.

</line>


<line>
He's enthusiastic about everything.

</line>


<line>
Oh, my God. Does he still have

that dumb magic eye poster?

</line>


<line>
What? No.

</line>


<line>
When we were married,

he was obsessed with it.

</line>


<line>
And he would make me

stare at it for hours.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, I bet.

</line>


<line>
But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.

And it was incredible.

</line>


<line>
And I was so happy

that I had waited long enough

to experience this beautiful thing,

and I felt so...

</line>


<line>
Why is this disgusting avocado

on my plate?

</line>


<line>
-Oh, I...

-I feel personally attacked right now.

</line>


<line>
-Oh, so sorry.

-[retches]

</line>


<line>
Anyway,

as I was saying about the poster,

it's funny how something so stupid

could have this tremendous power.

</line>


<line>
You know what I mean?

</line>


<line>
Yeah. I think I do.

</line>


<line>
<ital>A blog post about Jessica Biel</ital>

<ital>is gaining attention</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>for the seemingly minor detail</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>that the candidate</ital>

<ital>would not eat an avocado,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>calling the savory fruit,</ital>

<ital>quote, "disgusting."</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>Who doesn't like avocados?</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>I don't know if Jessica Biel</ital>

<ital>has the right judgment to lead California.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And I was totally convinced before,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-so it's really...</ital>

<ital>-Whoa!</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>...the avocado thing</ital>

<ital>that I have a problem with.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Why would you say

that you hate avocados?

</line>


<line>
I just have to live my truth, Katrina.

</line>


<line>
[groaning]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Her polls,</ital>

<ital>like an avocado exposed to air,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>have quickly turned from a verdant green</ital>

<ital>to a mushy brown.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>And with only seven days</ital>

<ital>until the election,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>her campaign might be in the pits.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Wow. Who'da thunk

that such a small trivial detail

could be the thing to take Biel down?

</line>


<line>
Yeah, who'da thunk it?

</line>


<line>
Who knew?

</line>


<line>
I knew. I put the avocado thing

in the story on purpose,

</line>


<line>
I knew people wouldn't like it.

</line>


<line>
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.

</line>


<line>
Even though it doesn't matter.

I don't need credit.

</line>


<line>
But it does, if I didn't do that,

it wouldn't have happened.

</line>


<line>
So, it's because of me.

</line>


<line>
-Well, whoever is responsible--

-Me. I just told you.

</line>


<line>
We shouldn't get too excited just yet.

</line>


<line>
The election is a week away,

and a lot can happen in a week.

</line>


<line>
This is far from over.

</line>


<line>
<ital>It's over. And the clear winner</ital>

<ital>is Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.</ital>

</line>


<line>
-All right!

-Huzzah!

</line>


<line>
-We did it!

-High five! [laughs] Low five!

</line>


<line>
Shadow puppet!

</line>


<line>
Hand jive! Yes!

</line>


<line>
[laughs]

</line>


<line>
-We did it, didn't we?

-We did!

</line>


<line>
You and me, working together,

both contributing the same amount.

</line>


<line>
Well, I wrote the article

that got Woodchuck elected governor.

</line>


<line>
You're the one that made him

not governor in the first place.

</line>


<line>
I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.

</line>


<line>
Thank you for meeting me here.

</line>


<line>
My name is Yolanda Buenaventura

of the Better Business Bureau.

</line>


<line>
It would be funnier

if your name was Betty Buenaventura

of the Better Business Bureau.

</line>


<line>
Well, I'm sorry you don't find

my name sufficiently comical,

but this is actually

a very serious matter.

</line>


<line>
-Oh.

-We've received complaints

from several concerned parents.

</line>


<line>
It seems that many

of your clown dentists

aren't actually licensed

to practice medicine.

</line>


<line>
Isn't laughter the <ital>best</ital> medicine?

</line>


<line>
No. It is the worst medicine.

</line>


<line>
If you can even call it medicine,

which, legally, you cannot.

</line>


<line>
Well, what if I said my business

was for entertainment purposes?

</line>


<line>
That would require your employees

to be entertaining.

</line>


<line>
According to your reviews on Yelp,

your clown dentists are, quote,

</line>


<line>
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian

invention that shakes one to the core."

</line>


<line>
Ah, everyone's a critic.

</line>


<line>
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.

</line>


<line>
It appears your business provides

no service but to terrify children

and the adults who accompany them.

</line>


<line>
If this were October,

you could market your venture

as some sort of spooky

Halloween experience,

but since this is January,

a month which, to my knowledge,

contains no Halloweens,

I have no choice but to--

</line>


<line>
Wait! Wait.

</line>


<line>
What if my clown dentists

put on a show?

</line>


<line>
A delightful, whimsical,

non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?

</line>


<line>
You would have to agree

we were a legitimate

business then, right?

</line>


<line>
-Go on.

-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.

</line>


<line>
If you don't laugh,

I'll dissolve the business

and release all my clown dentists

into the woods,

where they'll never bother anyone again.

</line>


<line>
All right.

</line>


<line>
You have one week to create a show

that delights and astonishes me.

</line>


<line>
But I should warn you,

I am a very tough crowd.

</line>


<line>
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party

and I did not find him charming.

</line>


<line>
-[bell ringing]

-Ooh!

</line>


<line>
-Excuse me.

-[overlapping chatter]

</line>


<line>
-Get outta my way.

-Like, hooked in a funny way.

</line>


<line>
You call that funny?

That's not funny. It's sad.

</line>


<line>
Well, some would argue

that sad and funny

</line>


<line>
-are two sides of the same coin.

-[cries out]

</line>


<line>
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln

and some weird flat house

are two sides of the same coin.

</line>


<line>
-Take five, Picarello.

-[bell ringing]

</line>


<line>
[groans] I've got a week

to whip these dentists into clowns.

</line>


<line>
-[crashing]

-[moaning]

</line>


<line>
But they're just not silly or wacky

or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind!

</line>


<line>
[sad quack]

</line>


<line>
-[gulping]

-[groans] Should you be drinking that?

</line>


<line>
Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.

Might as well get blotto, right? [hiccups]

</line>


<line>
-Um, shouldn't you be at work?

-I'm recal-bibrating.

</line>


<line>
-[horn honks]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-[horn honking]

-Ohh...

</line>


<line>
Hey, maybe you should--

</line>


<line>
-[phone buzzing]

-Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

</line>


<line>
-You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

</line>


<line>
What gal?

</line>


<line>
-So, you're a writer?

-Oh, actually that's a typo.

</line>


<line>
It should say "Waiter."

</line>


<line>
-But I'm an aspiring writer.

-Uh-huh.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, that was a joke.

</line>


<line>
That's the kind of witty repartee

you can expect from--

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah.

Thanks for the business card.

</line>


<line>
Wait, ya know,

</line>


<line>
-I have this idea for a TV show.

-Oh?

</line>


<line>
It's a grizzled former detective

who gets sucked back in--

</line>


<line>
This sounds fabulous.

</line>


<line>
Why don't you write a script,

we'll go from there?

</line>


<line>
-I already wrote it. Boom.

-Oh, you brought it with you.

</line>


<line>
I don't trust email.

You know, the government.

</line>


<line>
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,

</line>


<line>
I should tell you

that this town's a total crapshoot.

</line>


<line>
Odds of the right person

finding your material

and connecting with it

are a million to... one.

</line>


<line>
I just know I have this great potential

inside me. I know I can do it.

</line>


<line>
Even if no one else understands

or believes in me.

</line>


<line>
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...

</line>


<line>
It's not stupid. I believe in you.

</line>


<line>
I don't know how else to describe it

other than this feeling

of supreme warmth came over me,

like this is what I've been waiting for

my whole life.

</line>


<line>
That's amazing!

</line>


<line>
Todd, the world is dark and scary

and full of creepy clown dentists...

</line>


<line>
They're working very hard

to be less creepy.

</line>


<line>
But when I hold this script in my hands,

I have hope.

</line>


<line>
I gotta get this made.

What do I always say?

</line>


<line>
"What's the difference

between an agent and a manager?"

</line>


<line>
Uh, managers are always

talking about the differences

between agents and managers

and agents don't as much?

</line>


<line>
No! Managers can produce!

This script is a sign.

</line>


<line>
I gotta get off my ass

and produce this baby.

</line>


<line>
Todd? [hiccups]

</line>


<line>
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.

Set something up with his gal.

</line>


<line>
Who is this gal?

</line>


<line>
[snoring]

</line>


<line>
Okay. Clentists, assemble!

</line>


<line>
[clowns clamoring]

</line>


<line>
Wipe those serious looks

off your faces and listen up!

</line>


<line>
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,

but also we gotta prep

for our big show next week.

</line>


<line>
If only there was a way

to do both at once.

</line>


<line>
What a ludicrous notion!

</line>


<line>
Doctor Picarello,

we might make a clown out of you yet!

</line>


<line>
Oh, joy!

</line>


<line>
[cackling]

</line>


<line>
Special delivery.

</line>


<line>
This next part is critical. Remain wacky.

This is a highly frivolous situation!

</line>


<line>
-What's in the package?

-It's a hand delivery item.

</line>


<line>
Hey!

</line>


<line>
-Now, Doctor Boing Boing!

-I am in position.

</line>


<line>
[straining]

</line>


<line>
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

</line>


<line>
-[grunts]

-Whoa!

</line>


<line>
...before, so it's really the avocado 

thing that I have a problem with.

</line>


<line>
[grunts]

</line>


<line>
Target is acquired.

</line>


<line>
[mimics static] Deliver the goods,

Doctor Boing Boing!

</line>


<line>
Ah!

</line>


<line>
It's sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-showtime!

</line>


<line>
-Whoa!

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
-Princess Carolyn!

-Lenny, thanks for making time.

</line>


<line>
Didn't realize I had.

</line>


<line>
[sniffing] Are you drunk?

</line>


<line>
You smell like somebody

tried to put out a fire

at the booze factory with more booze.

</line>


<line>
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.

</line>


<line>
Now let's get to brass stacks.

</line>


<line>
So it's a hot young writer.

It's TV. It's me producing.

</line>


<line>
-"TV?"

-Just look at this script.

</line>


<line>
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.

</line>


<line>
Eh...

</line>


<line>
Know that website,

"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

you go to when you want

to know what time it is?

</line>


<line>
Yeah.

</line>


<line>
They look to make a play

in the gritty prestige streaming world,

and it could make a big splash

with a huge ad buy.

</line>


<line>
Plus, you got the built-in audience

who don't know what time it is.

</line>


<line>
That's huge! That's so many people!

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect

as their first series,

but we'd have to get in fast.

</line>


<line>
They wanna premiere

before Daylight Savings.

</line>


<line>
Let's set the pitch for next week.

</line>


<line>
<ital>Philbert?</ital> Who's Philbert?

</line>


<line>
He's this grizzled

but very good-looking detective

who gets sucked back in to something.

</line>


<line>
No, I mean who <ital>is </ital>he?

</line>


<line>
-You got a star attached?

-Not yet, but...

</line>


<line>
Eh, we can't go in without a big name.

</line>


<line>
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,

it's nothing without a big star.

</line>


<line>
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.

</line>


<line>
No! Fish!

</line>


<line>
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

</line>


<line>
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.

</line>


<line>
[mimics static] Don't let Turtletaub

get back to his office.

</line>


<line>
This sounds like a job

for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

</line>


<line>
[Todd] <ital>Doctor Picarello,</ital>

<ital>you gotta revive Princess Carolyn.</ital>

</line>


<line>
Give her ten cc's of honka-honka.

</line>


<line>
<ital>-Stat!</ital>

-[honking]

</line>


<line>
Oh!

[groans]

</line>


<line>
Hey! Hey! Pardon me. Excuse me!

</line>


<line>
-Oh! Allow me to lead, my lady.

-Wow.

</line>


<line>
-What the shell is this?

-So beautiful.

</line>


<line>
It says so much

without saying anything at all.

</line>


<line>
You gotta be kidding me.

</line>


<line>
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?

</line>


<line>
He owes me a favor

and he can disappear into any role.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, he can disappear so good,

the audience disappears with him.

</line>


<line>
-Tony Shalhoub!

-Tony Sha-who-ub?

</line>


<line>
This is

not "What-time-is-it-fifteen-years-ago

</line>

</line>


<line>
Please. I need this so bad.

You don't understand.

</line>


<line>
This project is my ba...

[hiccups] my ba...

</line>


<line>
-It's my baby.

-Well, if you can't attach a real star,

</line>


<line>
-your baby's dead.

-No!

</line>


<line>
Oh, thank you.

</line>


<line>
There's gotta be a name

that does something for you.

</line>


<line>
Uh, Jack Huston... Hugh... Hugh Jackman.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack Horseman!

-There's someone...

</line>


<line>
-Corbin Bernsen.

-No.

</line>


<line>
-Ben Mendelsohn.

-No, no, no. Hold on.

</line>


<line>
-BoJack. That's an idea.

-Yeah, yeah, sure. A BoJack-type.

</line>


<line>
[sighs] I swore I'd never work

with that asshole again,

but you gotta admit he's got heat.

</line>


<line>
Star of <ital>Secretariat,</ital>

<span style="style_3"/>disappears for a year,

shows up again to do one episode

of a reality show about butts.

</line>


<line>
Right, but--

</line>


<line>
And then you get him playing

a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert,

now there's a show that screams,

"What time is it right now?"

</line>


<line>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

</line>


<line>
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...

</line>


<line>
P.C., can you get me BoJack or not?

</line>


<line>
-Of course I can.

-I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.

</line>


<line>
I don't want to risk that jerkwad

skipping town again.

</line>


<line>
-Make sure he signs it before the pitch.

-Uh, will do.

</line>


<line>
And, uh, go easy on the sauce, huh, kid?

Sloppy don't suit you.

</line>


<line>
<ital>‚ô™ Rubber chicken</ital>

<ital>Rubber chicken ‚ô™</ital>

</line>


<line>
Ah, I got that damn thing

stuck in my head.

</line>


<line>
Guys, that was amazing!

</line>


<line>
But if we're going to convince Yolanda

we're ready for the big top,

we need to really hunker down

over the next week

and put together a show

so undeniably hilarious

and life-affirming,

that she has no choice but to say...

</line>


<line>
Wow! What a great show!

Okay, you can keep your business...

</line>


<line>
-Hooray!

-Perfect!

</line>


<line>
...is what I <ital>would</ital> say

if you'd put on a good show.

</line>


<line>
Just so you understand the rubric

when I declare my actual reaction,

which is: "I did not enjoy that."

</line>


<line>
-[clamoring]

-Oh, no! My hooray was premature!

</line>


<line>
So I must recommend that

you dissolve this venture immediately.

</line>


<line>
All right, you heard the lady.

Get into the car, everyone.

</line>


<line>
I'm taking you to the woods,

out by the old abandoned insane asylum,

near the elementary school

where you belong.

</line>


<line>
[horn honks]

</line>


<line>
[snoring]

</line>


<line>
Hey, so I'm taking

the rest of the day off.

</line>


<line>
What? Why?

</line>


<line>
Just don't feel like working right now,

so I think if I force it,

I'm just gonna do a bad job.

</line>


<line>
Thank you, Stuart.

</line>


<line>
But I did want to remind you

about that bitch meeting you have

</line>


<line>
-this afternoon at that clock website.

-You mean the pitch meeting.

</line>


<line>
Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting

on the calendar.

</line>


<line>
Seemed a little harsh.

I could go double-check,

but the calendar's

all the way downstairs so...

</line>


<line>
-No, Stuart. Thank you.

-You're welcome.

</line>


<line>
[sighs]

</line>


<line>
[dialing]

</line>


<line>
-[BoJack] <ital>What?</ital>

<ital>-</ital>Hey, BoJack, great news!

</line>


<line>
-Bad time. Can't talk.

-Wait, just listen for a...

</line>


<line>
-[dial tone]

-[sighs]

</line>


<line>
Okay.

</line>


<line>
Here we go, baby.

</line>


<line>
Oh, man!

You are not finding what you need!

</line>


<line>
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.

Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!

</line>


<line>
Tina is drawing so many cards.

It's amazing.

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?

</line>


<line>
-[body thuds in distance]

-Hollyhock?

</line>


<line>
[woman] That's her name?

</line>


<line>
Yes, for the third time,

her name is "Hollyhock."

</line>


<line>
And her last name?

</line>


<line>
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...

</line>


<line>
Is there more?

</line>


<line>
I think there's a Lopez

in the mix somewhere?

</line>


<line>
A Chung maybe?

</line>


<line>
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.

</line>


<line>
Okay, just... any information

you can give me

on the 17-year-old horse girl

who came here by ambulance

</line>


<line>
15 minutes ago would be

of interest to my friend,

</line>


<line>
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.

</line>


<line>
If you can't prove you're

her parent or legal guardian,

</line>


<line>
I can't release any information to you.

</line>


<line>
-Guerrero!

-What?

</line>


<line>
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...

Robinson...

</line>


<line>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.

That's her name.

</line>


<line>
And she's about five-eight.

</line>


<line>
And she's 17,

her birthday is in September.

</line>


<line>
And... she looks like me.

</line>


<line>
And she loves apples

but hates apple sauce.

</line>


<line>
And she's funny.

</line>


<line>
But she isn't mean.

Which is pretty remarkable,

</line>


<line>
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think

you have to be mean to be funny,

but Hollyhock is very sweet,

even if she can be sarcastic.

</line>


<line>
But she has this smile with...

</line>


<line>
Does that help?

</line>


<line>
No, man.

Are you her legal guardian?

</line>


<line>
I'm not leaving here

until I get to see her.

</line>


<line>
-Have a seat.

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
<ital>Well, I don't like</ital>

<ital>pedophile murderer hands,</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>but I also don't like people</ital>

<ital>talking trash about avocados.</ital>

</line>


<line>
<ital>-This is a real head-scratcher for me.</ital>

-[groans]

</line>


<line>
<ital>I mean, what's next?</ital>

<ital>The grief for every meal...</ital>

</line>


<line>
-[man] She'll be fine.

-Huh?

</line>


<line>
We have to think

what's best for Hollyhock.

</line>


<line>
-Hollyhock is going to be okay.

-Excuse me.

</line>


<line>
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you...

</line>


<line>
Jose Guerrero.

</line>


<line>
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.

I'm BoJack Horseman.

</line>


<line>
Yeah, we know.

I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.

</line>


<line>
I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.

</line>


<line>
I'm Dashawn Manheim.

</line>


<line>
I'm probably

the right Manheim to mess with,

unless we're talking about

a dance battle, in which case...

</line>


<line>
Five, six, seven, eight. Ha!

</line>


<line>
-You've been warned.

-Okay. Yep.

</line>


<line>
Cupe Robinson III.

I think you're just ghastly,

and I was against

this whole caper from the bell.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-Otto Zilberschlag.

</line>


<line>
Uh, formerly a huge fan.

</line>


<line>
-Now... just a regular fan.

-Got it.

</line>


<line>
I know <ital>of</ital> you,

but not through your work.

</line>


<line>
-Okay.

-I'm Gregory Hsung.

</line>


<line>
I only watch foreign films.

That's my deal.

</line>


<line>
Arturo Fonzarelli, but I'm pretty cool

so people call me the "Ice Man."

</line>


<line>
And I'm Quackers!

</line>


<line>
-Quack, quack, quack!

-Easy, Quackers.

</line>


<line>
How's Hollyhock?

They wouldn't give me information.

</line>


<line>
-Why would they? You're not her dad.

-No, I know. I just... Is she okay?

</line>


<line>
She will be.

The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.

</line>


<line>
What happened?

</line>


<line>
-She overdosed.

-What? No.

</line>


<line>
How could you let this happen?

Quack, quack!

</line>


<line>
-Quackers! Settle down.

-What was she on? I had no idea.

</line>


<line>
You had no idea?

</line>


<line>
Have you looked at her?

She's as thin as a pole.

</line>


<line>
You know I don't care

for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.

</line>


<line>
She told us you were

taking care of her.

</line>


<line>
-I was.

-I knew she was too young

to be on her own like this.

</line>


<line>
She's a child!

</line>


<line>
She called Pedro Almod√≥var's

<ital>I'm So Excited</ital> "excessively kitsch."

</line>


<line>
-Kitsch <ital>is</ital> excessive! That's the point!

-Can I see her? Can I talk to her?

</line>


<line>
-You're lucky we don't call the police!

-Quack, quack.

</line>


<line>
Our kid got hooked on amphetamines

because of you!

</line>


<line>
-No, I didn't...

-Quack, quack, quack, quack.

</line>


<line>
Okay, I feel like there's a lot

of male energy right now.

</line>


<line>
Why don't I come back in a couple hours?

</line>


<line>
Give Hollyhock a chance to rest

before I talk to her.

</line>


<line>
Are you insane?

You are never seeing Hollyhock again.

</line>


<line>
-Look, if I could just...

-Never.

</line>


<line>
[whimpers]

</line>


<line>
[muffled audio]

</line>


<line>
-I have four grapefruits.

-[panting] Okay.

</line>


<line>
Henrietta, would you like a grapefruit?

</line>


<line>
I have but four,

but I will share one with you,

for I am kind and honest.

</line>


<line>
[normal audio] No, no. No, no, no.

</line>


<line>
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

Oh, God.

</line>


<line>
[gasping]

</line>


<line>
[panting]

</line>


<line>
-Where's the girl?

-She's gone, Mom.

</line>


<line>
Oh, yes, I took her, didn't I?

Where did I put her?

</line>


<line>
Oh, Henrietta,

would you help me pack this?

</line>


<line>
-I want to bring it to my son.

-Thanks, Mom.

</line>


<line>
-It's for my son.

-Right. How did I not see it?

</line>


<line>
All this time, I thought

you were a terrible parent.

</line>


<line>
And you were.

But I blew it even worse.

</line>


<line>
It turns out being a parent is impossible,

so I guess I can't be that mad at you.

</line>


<line>
Mad at me? No, Henrietta,

this is the right thing. You'll see.

</line>


<line>
Maybe we deserve each other.

</line>


<line>
Where is the girl?

I made the girl coffee.

</line>


<line>
Jesus, you two and your coffee.

</line>


<line>
Wait. No.

</line>


<line>
-[panting]

-Oh!

</line>


<line>
What did you put in this?

</line>


<line>
That's an old family secret.

</line>


<line>
"Chub-B-Gone?"

</line>


<line>
-Takes the pounds right off.

-This whole time.

</line>


<line>
Just until she learned to take it herself.

</line>


<line>
-Of course it was you.

-Henrietta!

</line>


<line>
No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am

or-who-my-son-stuff" is,

is officially not cute anymore.

</line>


<line>
You ruined the one good thing I had.

</line>


<line>
The one thing I didn't ruin myself,

but of course I did

because I thought it was a good idea

to give you one more chance.

</line>


<line>
-Where is Crackerjack?

-Stop. You are out of chances.

</line>

No, I said "worst available room."

</line>


<line>
FYI, we keep these blinds down

because the window looks out

at a Dumpster.

</line>


<line>
-Noted.

-You know...

you kick me a little coin right now,

</line>


<line>
I can make sure your mother

is very well taken care of.

</line>


<line>
Oh! In that case, please watch me

not reach for my wallet.

</line>


<line>
Well, this is your life now.

This is what it all added up to.
